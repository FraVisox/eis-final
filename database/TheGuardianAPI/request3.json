Aviva is among a number of major European insurers that are backing the expansion of Poland’s coal industry, undermining international efforts to battle climate change, according to research from Unfriend Coal, a global network of organisations including Greenpeace Switzerland, 350.org and the UK Tar Sands Network. Aviva has invested £372.7m in Polish coal, more than any other insurance company apart from the Dutch firm Nationale Nederlanden, the report found. Poland’s coal industry is the second biggest in Europe, after Germany. Pollution from Polish coal is estimated to cause 5,830 premature deaths across Europe every year, Unfriend Coal said. The UN recently called for a stop to new coal power plants and an accelerated phase-out of existing ones. But Polish companies are planning to build power plants able to generate more than 10 gigawatts and open new mines holding more than 3.2bn tonnes of lignite, the dirtiest form of coal. Aviva’s investments are held through its Polish pension fund, OFE Aviva BZ WBK. The fund increased its holdings in Polish coal companies by more than £45m between 2016 and 2017. It has a 2.3% stake in the country’s largest power company PGE, which operates two of Europe’s most polluting coal plants at Bełchatów and Turów and plans to build new coal plants generating more than 5.2GW. Peter Bosshard, Unfriend Coal coordinator, said: “Unlike all other insurers which are taking action on coal, Aviva decided to focus on engagement rather than on divestment, and have only divested from very few companies if engagement was completely unproductive.” Aviva said it invested more than £525m in low-carbon projects such as renewable windfarms and solar energy last year. It added that it engaged with companies that derive more than 30% of revenue from coal to improve their business practices and will divest “where we do not see sufficient movement to transition away from coal”. “In Poland, local pension companies, including Aviva, manage customers’ assets under a strict regulatory regime and are not able to influence the investment strategy for these. The investment guidelines focus on domestic equity where the energy industry is the second largest after the banking sector,” it said. European insurers have invested more than £1.15bn in Polish coal companies and have signed at least 21 contracts insuring coal plants since 2013, according to Unfriend Coal. Europe’s biggest insurer, Allianz, is leading a consortium underwriting the biggest coal power plant under construction in Europe at Opole near Katowice, a PGE project, which is due to start operating next year. The consortium includes Italy’s Generali, Germany’s Munich Re and the Polish insurer PZU. Allianz said: “We will continue to insure utilities and mining companies when they show an adequate sustainability performance or suitable risk mitigation strategies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/22/renewables-roadshow-how-the-nonna-effect-changed-darebins-approach-to-solar","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T01:31:17Z","webTitle":"Renewables roadshow: how the 'nonna effect' got Darebin's pensioners signing up to solar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/22/renewables-roadshow-how-the-nonna-effect-changed-darebins-approach-to-solar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/22/renewables-roadshow-how-the-nonna-effect-changed-darebins-approach-to-solar","fields":{"headline":"Renewables roadshow: how the 'nonna effect' got Darebin's pensioners signing up to solar","bodyText":"In Darebin in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, solar installations have spread rapidly through the area’s low-income households. “We call it the ‘nonna effect’,” says Trent McCarthy, a Greens councillor in Darebin. “The nonna in the street has her solar on her roof. She’s very proud, she tells all of her friends. It’s social marketing 101.” It has spread throughout that area because the council has rolled out a program that allows local pensioners to install solar at no upfront cost and immediately start saving money, while the council recovers the full amount without interest over 10 years. While electricity bills can be a serious cause of stress for low-income households, and solar can help to reduce electricity bills, it is those very low income households that often struggle the most to find the initial outlay to cover the cost of a solar installation. As a result, those that can benefit most are often excluded. That observation was backed up by a survey run by the Darebin city council, says Gavin Mountjoy, the council’s environmental strategy coordinator. “We surveyed a lot of pensioners – about 4,000 pensioners – to see what were their main concerns,” Mountjoy says. Among the results, rising electricity prices jumped out as a major concern. But the survey also revealed pensioners didn’t know who to trust to get solar panels installed and they didn’t have the money to pay for the installation. So the council introduced the Solar Saver program. “The Solar Saver program started as a result of a council initiative to try to explore ways to help pensioners and low-income households deal with rising electricity prices,” Mountjoy says. The basic idea of the program is simple: the council would pay for the panels to be installed and get the money back over 10 years through a small additional charge to the home owner’s land rates. The first round of the program was open to low-income households who were receiving government income support. Colin Sutton lives in a quiet street in Preston, part of the Darebin local government area. He lives at home and cares for his adult son who has autistic spectrum disorder. He was one of the first locals to take part in the program. “I sell about $100 worth of power back to my power company every year, perhaps a little bit more,” he says. “And I estimate that I’m saving about $400 in actual power.” He pays $300 a year back to the council through his rates and estimates he is about $200 ahead already. After 10 years, the panels will be paid off and, assuming they’re still working, he will then be $500 ahead each year. The second round of the Solar Savers program sought to address another barrier to solar ownership: renting. For most landlords, it doesn’t make sense to install solar on a house you own – the tenants pay for electricity so the landlord takes the cost while the tenants make all the savings. So Darebin city council partnered with low-income housing cooperatives and organised a similar deal. Jen Jewel Brown lives in the Northcote Rental Housing Cooperative, which works with low-income renters. The homes are principally state government owned, but are managed and maintain by the co-op and are self-funded. That meant the Solar Savers scheme could recoup the cost of the solar panels through the co-op, which then recouped the cost by adding a small rise to the rent of the residents that received solar. Brown says the savings in the electricity bills immediately make up for the rent increase. And she says the program will help the cooperative itself expand. “Once we’ve actually paid off the panels on the roofs, then that will be a net gain to the co-op that will allow us to do more environmentally friendly things, or house more people – or both hopefully.” As the council survey revealed, one of the key reasons that prevent people from getting solar installed is the complexity of the market, namely what system to get and who to trust to advise them. Positive Charge is a non-profit company in Melbourne that supplies exactly that sort of advice. “We help residents, businesses, schools and community organisations find ways to save energy, reduce their greenhouse impact and also improve the comfort of their buildings,” says Kate Nicolazzo, the manager of Positive Charge. “Positive Charge was, I guess, the trusted adviser. We were in a position where we could make sure people were getting the right advice around the sort of size system they should be putting on their house and that any of the considerations were being taken into account to make sure people weren’t being taken advantage of and that council could actually support their installation of solar.” Nicolazzo says the Solar Savers program broke down the age barriers to becoming a solar owner. “For this project, we had a man in his 80s come along to one of the information sessions and we thought he was the person who was going to be putting solar on their roof,” Nicolazzo recalls. “And he said no, that’s actually for my father. So, with the Solar Savers program, one of our great stories was a 102-year-old man putting solar on his roof because he understood that the benefits lasted way beyond his lifespan.” McCarthy says the program was a first in Australia but is now being explored all around the country. “Solar Savers has been a little bit of a quiet rooftop revolution.” But McCarthy says state and federal governments could help to speed up the uptake of solar around the country, as well as make programs like Solar Saver more effective. “We’d love to see this program scaled up but we know that one of the biggest barriers is actually the feed-in tariff,” he says. “We’d like to see a fair price for solar, which means the power that people are generating on their roof, which is a renewable energy. They’re getting a fair price compared to what they would be paying for fossil fuel energy from a power company.” But, regardless, he says the program has been a success for everyone involved. “This is one of those programs that is a win-win-win,” McCarthy says. The environment and the residents win, while the council makes back most of its money and also gets closer to its zero-greenhouse gas target. “But, importantly, it makes a bit of a community change because it shows that, at the grassroots level, we can make a difference by aggregating the community [and] by bringing people together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/aug/24/james-bond-on-film-ranked","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-24T08:38:07Z","webTitle":"James Bond on film – 007's best and worst movies ranked!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/24/james-bond-on-film-ranked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/aug/24/james-bond-on-film-ranked","fields":{"headline":"James Bond on film – 007's best and worst movies ranked!","bodyText":"26. Casino Royale (1967) Wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Even a cameo from Orson Welles couldn’t lend lustre to this pointless and unfunny spoof, a dire tongue-in-cheeker that slipped past the franchise control of the producers, Eon. David Niven saunters unsexily as the retired “Sir James Bond” in this chaotic film. 25. Die Another Day (2002) Oh lawdy. The Bond franchise was looking lost in the grim and joyless new “war on terror”-era, and this movie featured the worst gadget in the history of 007: an invisible car. What on earth is the point of that? You can almost see the P45 being pressed into Brosnan’s hand. 24. The Living Daylights (1987) This was the turn of straight actor and RSC stalwart Timothy Dalton. He was supposedly there to give Bond a hard and gritty new seriousness, but always just looked a bit humourless. This was during the Aids era of sexual restraint, too, so Bond only cops off a couple of times. 23. Licence to Kill (1989) Bond goes rogue, and Dalton stays dull. This one is notable for the young Benicio del Toro as a humble henchman. After this, legal copyright rows caused a six-year production hiatus during which Dalton quit. 22. For Your Eyes Only (1981) You can hear a whistling and a crackling in the air as Roger Moore begins to tune out. The stunts hold up, but Moore is on the exit ramp and his flaccid relationship with 24-year-old Carole Bouquet is a deathly embarrassment. 21. Never Say Never Again (1983) The title is what Connery’s agent should have shouted at him when he was offered the comeback: (“Never”! Say “Never”! Again!) Connery lumbers back for the remake of Thunderball that no one wanted or needed. He was never a six-pack guy at the best of times, but he’s out of condition here. One to forget. 20. Quantum of Solace (2008) Much mocked at the time, this film wasn’t as bad as that – despite the silliest title in the series’ history. Craig is always watchable and Mathieu Amalric is a very eccentric oddball villain. 19. The World Is Not Enough (1999) Not bad, but some of the fizz has gone. In this film, the distinction between villain and henchman seems to collapse with three bad guys: Robert Carlyle, Robbie Coltrane and, erm, Goldie, who was very big in those days. 18. GoldenEye (1995) Was it a Bondaissance? A Brosnanaissance? Whatever. Stylish yet assertive smoothie Pierce Brosnan had already made an impression in the TV caper Remington Steele. He took to Bond like a duck to water: virile, cool, nice suits. Judi Dench made her debut as M. Bond was back! 17. A View to a Kill (1985) Quite unexpectedly, Moore pulled it back a bit for his last hurrah. (It was also, sadly, the last hurrah for Lois Maxwell’s Miss Moneypenny.) Christopher Walken was always destined to play a Bond villain and it came to pass in this film, as the evil electronics mogul Max Zorin. A good note for Moore to bow out on. 16. Moonraker (1979) A whopping, megabudget Bond in its day, clearly influenced by the Star Wars-led sci-fi revival. It is all about the theft of a space shuttle, but this excursion into space can’t conceal the fact that Moore is looking a bit jaded. 15. On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969) George Lazenby’s sole appearance wasn’t a bad Bond. Had he done more, Lazenby might have become a favourite. Diana Rigg played the woman who shows 007 is no commitmentphobe. They marry, before gunfire poignantly restores Bond’s eternal singledom. 14. Diamonds Are Forever (1971) Uh-oh. Connery was tempted back to the role with a big pay packet, now looking craggier and toupeed. Ernst Blofeld, boringly played by Charles Gray, wants to use diamonds to focus his space laser. Bond girl Tiffany Case was played by Jill St John, whose real-life boyfriend, Henry Kissinger, would have been better as the villain. 13. Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) It took a spanking from Titanic at the box office, but this is a good, underrated Bond: one of the very few films (or plays or books) to satirise Rupert Murdoch and his Chinese expansionist plans – a rather taboo subject in 90s media. Jonathan Pryce has great fun with the role of the villainous mogul. 12. Octopussy (1983) Outrageously daft, but silly and fun. Roger Moore wears a gorilla costume. 11. The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) This has a well-loved Bond song, Carly Simon’s Nobody Does It Better. It also introduced us to the exotic henchman Jaws. The action opens with that staggering skiing-off-a-cliff stunt, just after Moore is seen supposedly skiing in front of an obvious back projection. 10. The Man With the Golden Gun (1974) Despite iffy reviews at the time, this has one of the very best villains, wonderfully played by Christopher Lee: Scaramanga, he of the creepy third nipple. It is a preposterous 70s fuel-crisis drama about a solar energy device. There’s some funky martial arts, too. 9. Skyfall (2012) An excellent, intelligent Bond which shrewdly expanded the role of Judi Dench’s M, developed her relationship with 007 and created a plausible, sympathetic backstory for him. Javier Bardem got his teeth into the villain role. 8. Live and Let Die (1973) And so began the reign of Roger Moore, tacitly conceding the campness that many saw as unavoidable for Bond. Moore was witty, sprightly and a mature 46 when he took over (Connery had started at 32.) This movie has a great song from Paul McCartney and Wings. 7. Thunderball (1965) The evil organisation Spectre had its first appearance in Fleming’s Thunderball novel, but we were used to it by now, this being the fourth outing for 007 on the big screen. Good stuff here, but the franchise faltered a bit, with long underwater sequences. 6. Spectre (2015) Boom! Craig and director Sam Mendes bring off an absolutely storming 007 extravaganza, kicking off with a head-banging action sequence in Mexico City. Léa Seydoux has a Veronica Lake-type sultriness and Ben Whishaw almost steals the show as the geeky Q. 5. Casino Royale (2006) Daniel Craig had to face a lot of internet bickering when he was cast, but he blew everyone away with a performance that was just right: cool, cruel, ruthless, yet sardonic. It was great at the time and looks even better now. One of the best Bonds. 4. Dr No (1962) Sean Connery’s first outing in the Bond role. It gave us the gun-barrel titles and the Monty Norman theme. There was Ursula Andress in the bikini and the exotic Johnny Foreigner villain with an outrageous island lair. 3. From Russia With Love (1963) Weirdly ungadgety and downbeat. Connery searches his hotel room for bugs for what seems like 10 minutes, with the theme music playing deafeningly. There’s a great train fight with Robert Shaw’s Red Grant. 2. Goldfinger (1964) “You eckshpect me to talk?” “No, Mr Bond, I expect you to DIE!” This introduced us to Bond’s Aston Martin DB5 and the weird spectacle of Shirley Eaton suffocating in gold. It established the convention whereby the villain leaves 007 time to escape some elaborate automated death. 1. You Only Live Twice (1967) This great action movie put Connery’s Bond right back on top and introduced us to the Nehru-suit-wearing, cat-stroking master criminal Spectre chief, Blofeld, played by Donald Pleasence. Connery announced his intention to quit after this. Perhaps he knew it could never be this good again?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/may/17/people-power-tasmanian-residents-to-store-solar-energy-and-sell-it-back-to-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-16T23:49:30Z","webTitle":"People power: Tasmanian residents to store solar energy and sell it back to grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/17/people-power-tasmanian-residents-to-store-solar-energy-and-sell-it-back-to-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/17/people-power-tasmanian-residents-to-store-solar-energy-and-sell-it-back-to-grid","fields":{"headline":"People power: Tasmanian residents to store solar energy and sell it back to grid","bodyText":"There are more than 1.5m households in Australia with rooftop solar. And in a few months time, 40 Tasmanian homeswill be acting as mini power stations – not just producing energy for their own consumption and to export back into the grid, but actively trading and profiting from the power they generate. Much has been written about rooftop solar and the impending boom in battery storage but the key ingredient to turning homes into mini-power stations is the software that links the hardware of these technologies. Now the Canberra-based startup Reposit Power is helping to change the way households and energy companies think about solar and storage. The trial that is to start in Bruny Island, south of Hobart, will see the households equipped with rooftop solar, battery storage, and Reposit’s GridCredits software. There are numerous reasons why Bruny Island is an attractive place for the trial. Firstly it relies on a cable link to the mainland for the bulk of its power, and the trial will provide solid information to TasNetworks about how self-sufficient the island can become. The second reason is that Bruny experiences huge spikes of demand during the holiday season, and the use of battery storage can possibly help to reduce those big demand peaks, and therefore the size of the cable that serves the island. The greater the demand, the bigger the connection needed. And lastly it is attractive to the households. The GridCredits software automates trading with the network. Instead of getting the base 5.6c/kWh for exports back into the grid of surplus solar power, households can store the energy until the grid really needs it, and then might be able to receive up to $1/kWh for those exports. That effectively turns them into mini-power stations, although the software is doing all the heavy lifting. A Reposit Power co-founder, Dean Spaccavento, says it is yet another step towards Australia’slong-term goal of switching off from fossil fuels, as well as delivering on predictions that one half of all demand will be sourced from homes, businesses and communities. “The end game is to turn off coal,” Spaccavento says. “The nice way to say it is to improve the operation of the electricity system, both in how it is run, and how solar and other renewables are injected into the grid. “So the idea is to manage the system, keep prices low, ensure everyone has power when they need it, and allow greater penetration of renewables. Reposit Power’s software is the glue that keeps the system together and ensures that customers are being paid properly for the electricity that the system is using.” The trial also involves the University of Sydney, the University of Tasmania and the Australian National University. They will use the trial to research the ideal sizing of solar and storage systems, how much households should be paid, and through what mechanism. The research is important because it is now acceptedthat about half of all electricity demand will one day come from rooftop solar and battery storage from households and businesses, or near the point of consumption. This is known as distributed energy, a different system to the centralised system that has ruled the grid for a century or more. Configuring how this works is crucial, given the complexity of the electricity system. It is not just a matter of setting tariffs, but also recognising the value of various technologies. This has been at the heart of the discussion about the new feed-in-tariffs for rooftop solar, which have been slashed to little more than the average wholesale price of electricity, despite the benefits it brings in reducing and narrowing peaks, avoiding system upgrades, and cutting the amount of fossil fuels burned. Spaccavento says through the Reposit Power systems, consumers get paid for the use of the battery storage at specific times. “The Reposit box is your personal trading desk,” he says. “It operates on your behalf but will take instructions from the local utility – in this case TasNetworks.” It is fast, he says, and can both produce and consume power in an instant. “It’s just the type of power station that the future needs. We think it’s very important that homes across Australia be able to participate in electricity markets.” The software is designed to integrate with the wholesale market, and the newly expanding markets of network support and ancilliary services, which will help to keep the grid stable. And by doing this, Spaccavento says the technology addresses the frustration that households experience by getting paid so little for their solar exports. He argues that households should stay with the grid. “We actively discourage people from leaving the grid. But if you want to clean it up, the right thing to do is to offer a system at the right rates. “When people feel disempowered, they will make radical decisions. We are finding a way to empower them, rather than encouraging them to withdraw.” The Australian Renewable Energy Agency is contributing $2.9m towards the project, but the Arena chief executive, Ivor Frischknecht, is looking beyond just solar and storage. “Because Bruny Island has a very high penetration of renewables and a very good wind resource; [the question] is how can you actually use renewables and storage in combination ...to supply secure energy to the people there? “They have a particular problem, in that lots of holidaymakers go there, so there are times of the year when they have lots of demand. And if they have lots of demand and there’s no sun or wind at that moment, what do they do? And so it’s about designing a whole network that way.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"science/2018/oct/21/frances-arnold-interview-ability-engineer-most-complicated-things-on-planet-nobel-prize-enzymes-chem","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-21T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Frances Arnold: ‘To expect a Nobel prize is rather silly’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/21/frances-arnold-interview-ability-engineer-most-complicated-things-on-planet-nobel-prize-enzymes-chem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/oct/21/frances-arnold-interview-ability-engineer-most-complicated-things-on-planet-nobel-prize-enzymes-chem","fields":{"headline":"Frances Arnold: ‘To expect a Nobel prize is rather silly’","bodyText":"This month, Frances Arnold, professor of chemical engineering at Caltech in California, was awarded the 2018 Nobel prize in chemistry, shared with two others. She’s the fifth female chemistry laureate since the prizes first began in 1901, and the only ever American woman to win in the subject. Where were you when you got the news you had won the Nobel prize? I was in deep sleep in a Dallas hotel room having arrived at midnight to give a lecture the next day. The phone rang at 4am. I was worried that it was some emergency at home. Then I saw that the telephone number was from Europe and I thought maybe I had better answer it. Though I had been given hints in the past, I certainly didn’t expect it. There are many wonderful chemists whose work deserves the Nobel prize and to expect one is rather silly. Were you always interested in engineering? I was always making things, mostly art projects, but I was also very good at and loved maths – especially geometry – and puzzles. And I was always interested in technology. My father was a nuclear physicist who revelled in the scholastic achievements of his children. I had four brothers who I loved to compete with and we were all equally encouraged. I took mechanical drawing, geometry and typing at high school, the latter because that is what they did with smart girls in those days! What turned you on to biotechnology? I studied mechanical engineering at Princeton and worked on solar energy after graduation. But the industry’s prospects changed for the worse in the early 1980s and I decided to do my PhD in chemical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. I had initially intended to work on biofuels but I stumbled on this new field of biotechnology. The ability to engineer the most complicated things on our planet – biological systems – was too much of a draw to ignore. Your Nobel prize was awarded for the “directed evolution of enzymes”. What’s that? It is basically breeding, similar to mating cats or dogs to bring out desired traits, but at the level of molecules. The aim is to create new and better biological material in the form of enzymes, which are proteins that catalyse chemical reactions. And this allows us to use greener biological manufacturing processes to make the fuels, chemicals and materials we use in our daily lives. It starts with a gene, a stretch of DNA that encodes for the particular enzyme to be enhanced. In a test tube under error-prone conditions, the DNA is copied so a small number of random mutations are introduced. The hard chemistry is then actually done by bacteria – which read DNA and make beautiful proteins according to a DNA code. Those millions of genes each with a few errors in them are inserted into the bacteria, which make the enzymes with a few errors in them. The enzymes are then tested to see which are better than the original, for example more active in a particular environment. Their genes are then taken and the cycle repeated to acquire new traits. It is evolution guided and sped up by artificial selection. Your seminal paper which first demonstrated that this method worked was published in 1993. You started with the enzyme subtilisin, which breaks down milk protein, and used directed evolution to produce a version of it that worked not in a water-based solution but in an organic solvent. Did you have a kind of “aha” moment when you suddenly realised it worked? The thinking [prior to this paper] was very different. People thought you should design new enzymes using logic and knowledge of how proteins function – but that approach hadn’t yielded successful results. We showed you didn’t have to do it that way: you could do it by using directed evolution instead. The 1993 paper was the culmination of about three years of work which started in the late 1980s, soon after I joined Caltech. It was an “aha” set of months when we saw we could breed surprising new traits. We had wondered: would beneficial mutations be common enough? Could we measure them? Could we create anything in a short enough timescale that would allow me to get a tenure at Caltech? The ‘“aha” realisation meant the answer was yes! Enzymes developed by your method are used today to make everything from laundry detergents to biofuels and medicines. What applications are you most proud of? I never patented the basic technology, which was a good thing, because it meant use spread to other labs. One of the most compelling applications has been by the drug maker Merck &amp; Co, which developed an enzyme through directed evolution to make the drug Januvia, used to treat diabetes. That was formerly made using toxic metals, with a lot of waste products. Have you worked on any applications? I have worked on enzymes to make better biofuels, co-founding a company, Gevo, to do this in 2005. More recently, I have started a company, Provivi, with two of my former students to make nontoxic alternatives to pesticides that draw on the method. What are you working on in your lab at the moment? Evolution is good for optimising and that is well understood. But evolution also creates things that no one knew were even possible. In the test tube, I can make any DNA I want, recombining it from monkeys, worms, anywhere. So I can explore new rules of breeding with molecules. We’ve recently evolved enzymes that make chemical bonds not found in nature. For example, in 2016, we published the first enzyme to forge carbon-silicon bonds. Products ranging from paint to personal care items contain carbon-silicon bonds, all made using precious metal catalysts like platinum. This work opens up the possibility that biology could make them more cheaply and cleanly. Some people find it remarkable that there are two female winners this year of Nobel prizes because it is usually all men (Donna Strickland became the third woman ever to win a Nobel prize in physics). Are you supportive of the Nobel committees having written to nominators for 2019 to ask them to be more inclusive to make sure they don’t leave women or ethnic minorities out? It is remarkable – and wonderful. But also not surprising because there are women doing fabulous physics and chemistry. I predict this is the beginning of a steady stream. To ask nominators to think about this is a really good thing because it is when you think about it that you realise how many brilliant women there are. To get the prize, you first have to be nominated. That means someone has to care enough about you to take the time to explain your science to someone else. Men often have a good network of people who are willing to do that for them. Women need to cultivate those networks and often they are not as pushy about that as some of the men are. We have to learn how to be pushy or at least ask and I am gratified to see that my younger colleagues are starting to do that. Sexual harassment is rife in the sciences according to a report published this June by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Have you experienced it in your working life? Do we need female scientists to speak out about their experiences? In so far as stupid sexist remarks and behaviour, yes, but I am gifted with the ability to ignore those people and that has served me well. However, I certainly understand that many women are more sensitive than I am. I think that women should talk about their experiences to the extent it helps them come to terms with what they have experienced. And people need to listen and understand that these experiences can have a dramatic, negative effect on one’s career. You’ve been dealt some challenging and tragic events in your personal life – you’ve lost two husbands (your first to cancer, your second by suicide), one of your three sons was killed in an accident and you underwent treatment for breast cancer. Does your work provide certainty – some respite from the randomness and misfortunes of life? I certainly find respite at my institution, Caltech, where I have been for 30 years and have a wonderful group of close friends. I also find grounding in working with students. I have a steady stream of brilliant young people coming through my laboratory whose curiosity and love of science are tremendous positive forces. I have also learned how to be grateful for what I have rather than sorry for what I don’t. That helps me look at the good side of things. Where do you get your ideas? I had one good idea back in the 1980s and have been working on that ever since! I see my job as helping to promote the ideas of my students. They are looking at biology with this whole new set of eyes and their brains are full of possibilities. I am a very good editor of ideas and if I can help them hone those, that is immensely satisfying. What words of advice would you give young women who want a career in science or engineering? Don’t leave this wonderful, fun work just for the men."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/nov/15/climate-change-democrats-oil-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-15T11:00:33Z","webTitle":"Big Oil v the planet is the fight of our lives.

Democrats must choose a side","bodyText":"The world’s leading scientists issued a report warning of total planetary dystopia unless we take immediate steps to seriously reduce carbon emissions. Then, oil and gas corporations dumped millions of dollars into the 2018 elections to defeat the major initiatives that could have slightly reduced fossil fuel use. Though you may not know it from the cable TV coverage, this was one of the most significant – and the most terrifying – stories of the midterms. For those who actually care about the survival of the human race, the key questions now should be obvious: is there any reason to hope that we will retreat from “drill baby drill” and enact a sane set of climate policies? Or is our country – and, by extension, our species – just going to give up? Before answering, it is worth reviewing exactly what happened over these last few months, because the election illustrates how little the fossil fuel industry is willing to concede in the face of a genuine crisis. While the dominant media narrative has been about Democratic voters euphorically electing a House majority and yelling a primal scream at Donald Trump, the loudest shriek of defiance was the one bellowed by oil and gas CEOs. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that we have only 12 years to ward off an ecological disaster, those oil and gas executives’ message to Planet Earth was unequivocal: drop dead. That message was most explicit in Colorado, where a drilling and fracking boom is happening in the middle of fast-growing suburbs. With oil and gas companies seeking to put noxious derricks and rigs near population centers, local activists backed a ballot measure called Proposition 112 that aimed to make sure new fossil fuel infrastructure is set a bit farther away from schools, hospitals, residential neighborhoods and water sources. The initiative was an angry response to a state government so awash in fossil fuel campaign cash that it has blocked legislation to merely allow regulators to prioritize the health and safety of residents when those regulators issue permits for drilling and fracking. According to an industry analysis, Proposition 112 would have left much of the oil and gas reserves near Denver accessible for extraction, but yes, it is true – at a time when climate scientists say we must keep fossil fuel deposits in the ground, there was a chance the initiative would have stopped some extraction. The oil and gas industry could have looked across a Colorado ravaged by climate-intensified wildfires, droughts and floods and decided to accept the modest measure, knowing that the initiative is the absolute minimum that is required at this perilous moment. Instead, fossil fuel companies did the opposite: they poured $40m into opposing Proposition 112 and spreading insidious agitprop. Despite scientists warning that fracked natural gas threatens to worsen climate change, oil and gas operatives in the state promoted cartoonishly dishonest claims that burning fossil fuel “is cleaning our air and improving health”. As Colorado’s local media effectively erased the term “climate change” from its election coverage, the industry managed to defeat the measure by outspending its proponents 40-to-1. In the process, fossil fuel companies’ scorched-earth campaign was a clear statement that in the face of an environmental cataclysm, oil and gas moguls will not accept even a tiny reduction in their revenues. In the Pacific north-west and the south-west, it was a similar tale. In Washington State, petroleum giants funneled $25m into defeating a proposal to require polluters to pay some of the costs of the climate change havoc they are wreaking. The measure, which would have assessed a $15 fee for every ton of greenhouse gases they emit, was beaten with 56% of the vote, after the industry’s ad campaign featured criticism from a former state attorney general – who viewers weren’t told now works at Chevron’s law firm. In all, $13m of the funding against the measure came from BP – a company that simultaneously claims to unsuspecting consumers that it supports a carbon tax. In sun-baked Arizona, you may have thought solar energy would be a fairly easy pitch. However, after the owner of the state’s major energy provider poured nearly $30m into the election, Arizonans soundly rejected a ballot initiative to force the utility to get more of its power from renewable sources. Meanwhile, in a single California county, the fossil fuel industry spent a whopping $8m to defeat a citizens’ initiative to ban new drilling and fracking. Realizing that they may have overreached, some fossil fuel industry spokespeople are now telling lawmakers that oil and gas companies really do want to work collaboratively on environmental issues. However, their behavior in the election proved that the industry is not operating in good faith. Oil and gas CEOs showed that they will gladly accelerate the climate crisis if doing so allows them to rake in more money. And make no mistake about it: the industry’s roughly $100m in campaign spending this year was not just about one individual election cycle. It was a shock-and-awe spectacle designed to intimidate any prospective campaigns, organizations and movements that want to challenge the political supremacy of oil and gas – and some prominent Democrats in Washington seem to be cowering in fear. Always nervous about the donor class and about electoral blowback from Republicans, some congressional Democrats now seem intent on avoiding any direct confrontation over climate change policy. Indeed, days before the election, the Hill newspaper surveyed lawmakers and major environmental groups, and found that “Democrats are unlikely to pursue major climate change legislation if they win the House majority, despite a growing body of evidence suggesting time is running out to address the issue.” As her own state was being incinerated by climate-intensified wildfires, the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, faced pressure for climate action from new lawmakers like New York Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – but Pelosi would only commit to reviving a moribund congressional committee to study the issue. The conflict-averse posture follows the party recently rescinding its policy of rejecting fossil fuel campaign cash, as well as Democratic Representative Vicente Gonzalez of climate-ravaged Texas setting up a new Oil &amp; Gas Caucus to promote the “economic benefits of fully harnessing the country’s natural resources”. Taken together, these developments – coupled with the Trump administration’s opposition to any serious climate policy – have left many voters and activists feeling despondent, even in the aftermath of a “blue wave” election. As former Bernie Sanders campaign aide Claire Sandberg tweeted: “Entire towns are burning to nothing in California. People are being incinerated alive in their cars attempting to flee. But a majority of Democrats still won’t reject fossil fuel money, and no one has put forward a climate plan that is remotely commensurate with the IPCC findings.” And yet, amid the thick smoke of wildfires and industry propaganda, there is still reason to believe that our children are not guaranteed to live in a real-life version of Mad Max: Fury Road. Our fate is not – yet – sealed, as long as those who want humanity to survive pay attention to exactly what science, the fossil fuel industry and the political trends are telling us, and then act accordingly in the arenas where immediate progress is most likely. First and foremost, there are now 14 states that have the trifecta of Democratic control of the governorship and both legislative chambers. Those include major fossil fuel producing states such as Colorado, New Mexico and California. Democratic leaders in these states cannot claim that climate inaction is a product of Republican intransigence – the Democrats in these locales have uninhibited power. And so if activists work to hold these local Democratic lawmakers accountable, there is a good chance they can force legislatures to enact emissions standards, renewable energy mandates and other environmental rules that will bolster the fight against climate change. Similarly, states and cities collectively control trillions dollars of public pension money that can be marshaled for the battle. Shifting that cash out of oil and gas can at once provide more capital for renewable energy and drain fossil fuel companies of resources they need for their extraction binge. Officials like New York comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, incoming Connecticut treasurer Shawn Wooden and North Carolina treasurer Dale Folwell may be unknown compared with the average backbench senator on the Sunday chat shows, but they and their colleagues who control these massive war chests have an enormous amount of divestment power that can both support the climate change fight, and boost investment returns for retirees. There’s a good chance that at least some of them can be spurred to action if they are no longer permitted to toil in obscurity, and instead face consistent grassroots pressure. The courts are another arena where the climate fight seems to be accelerating. There, teenagers are mounting a landmark case arguing that the government’s refusal to restrict carbon emissions is endangering the next generation’s constitutional right to life, liberty and property. A federal judge also just blocked the Keystone XL pipeline, saying that the Trump administration had improperly “discarded prior factual findings related to climate change”. At the same time, state attorneys general are pursuing a lawsuit examining whether the oil industry deliberately buried science that showed the dangers of climate change. Those cases, which bring even more pressure on the industry, can be supported by concurrent hearings and subpoenas from the low-profile House science committee, which is expected to be chaired by Texas Democratic Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who has called for more aggressive action on climate change. So, considering both the election setbacks and opportunities, let’s go back to those original questions: is there reason to hope or are we just going to give up? The answer is contingent on our ability to focus in an age of distraction. Will those who truly care about the survival of humanity muster the discipline to occasionally look away from the Washington DC garbage fire and focus more activism on the state and local level? Will a media that obsesses over Trump’s tweets find the will to more diligently cover a climate crisis that threatens the planet? Will our political class behold the fossil fuel industry’s sociopathy and realize that we face an existential choice between profits and ecological survival? In short, will we as a society finally start treating this emergency as an actual emergency? If the answer is yes, then there is still reason to believe we are not doomed – but we better get to work, because there’s no time to spare.

David Castillo Mejía, the executive president of the company building a dam which Cáceres campaigned against, is the ninth person arrested for the murder, and the fourth with ties to the Honduran military. Castillo Mejía is accused by arresting authorities of providing logistical support and other resources to one of the hitmen already charged. He is the first person to be charged as being the “intellectual author” of Cáceres’s murder and the attempted murder of Mexican environmentalist Gustavo Castro. Cáceres was shot in her bedroom just before midnight on 2 March 2016, a year after winning the prestigious Goldman Prize for leading a campaign against the Agua Zarca dam on the Gualcarque river considered sacred by the indigenous Lenca community. The dam was licensed to the company Desarrollos Energéticos SA (Desa) without the legally required community consultation. Cáceres had led a campaign of peaceful community resistance against the dam which triggered a wave of repression including smear campaigns, violent evictions, sexual harassment, false criminal charges, and ultimately her murder. Before her death, Cáceres had said that she was scared of Castillo Mejía because of his military intelligence background. She told close friends and family that Castillo Mejía hounded her with texts, phone calls, and in person, appearing without warning at her home, work events and even the airport. He was arrested at San Pedro Sula international aiport trying to leave the country, the public ministry confirmed in a tweet alongside a photo of Castillo Mejía in custody. The US ambassador to Honduras Heidi Fulton praised investigators for capturing Castillo Mejía in a series of tweets. Last September, Castillo Mejía used the same platform to thank the embassy for inviting him to a solar energy conference in Las Vegas. Castillo Mejía attended the event in his capacity as president of the energy company PEMSA (Desarrollador de Proyectos de Energía Eléctrica) – one of two major shareholders in Desa. A Guardian investigation into the murder found that Cáceres appeared on a military hitlist given to US-backed elite forces just months before she was murdered. The murder was carried out like a “well-planned operation designed by military intelligence”, a legal source told the Guardian last year. Desa’s board also includes a former justice minister and several members of the Atala Zablah family, part of one of the richest and most powerful clans in Honduras. The company vice-president, Jacobo Nicolás Atala Zablah, is president of the BAC Honduras bank. His cousin Camilo owns the country’s biggest bank, Banco Fichosa. In a statement Desa said neither it nor its president Castillo Mejía had anything to do with the murder. “The company rejects this decision that is the result of international pressure and smear campaigns from various NGOs towards the company,” the statement said. Other suspects charged in connection with the murder are Sergio Ramón Rodríguez Orellana, a Desa manager; Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, a former infantry officer and close friend of Mariano Díaz Chávez, a special forces major who fought with coalition forces in Iraq; and former soldier Henry Javier Hernández Rodríguez, the suspected point man on the night of the murder. The accused hitmen are brothers Edilson and Emerson Duarte Meza, Elvin Heriberto Rápalo Orellana and Óscar Aroldo Torres Velásquez. News of the arrest broke while protests took place across the country to demand justice for the slain leader – who is one of at least 130 environment and land defenders murdered in Honduras since the 2009 coup. The Cáceres family has repeatedly condemned authorities for their secrecy and slow progress on the case. In a statement, the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (Copinh) – the organisation co-founded by Cáceres 25 years ago and now led by her second eldest daughter Bertita Zúñiga Cáceres – said: “The arrest is thanks to the work and pressure by national and international organisations. No thanks is due to the attorney general’s office, who have tried everything possible to cover up the truth in this case … Copinh will continue to denounce the entire murderous, criminal structure behind the assassination of our sister Berta Cáceres, of which David Castillo is just one piece.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2021/mar/30/australia-news-live-brisbane-covid-lockdown-andrew-laming-coalition-labor-qld-nsw-victoria","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-03-30T07:24:48Z","webTitle":"Queensland reports eight new local Covid cases; NT chief minister in self-isolation – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/mar/30/australia-news-live-brisbane-covid-lockdown-andrew-laming-coalition-labor-qld-nsw-victoria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2021/mar/30/australia-news-live-brisbane-covid-lockdown-andrew-laming-coalition-labor-qld-nsw-victoria","fields":{"headline":"Queensland reports eight new local Covid cases; NT chief minister in self-isolation – as it happened","bodyText":"With that, I’m going to wrap things up here. Thanks for following along today. Before I leave you, here’s a summary of the main stories of the day. Queensland reported eight new cases of Covid-19, as greater Brisbane continued its snap three-day lockdown and federal authorities declared the city a hotspot under Commonwealth guidance. The NSW National leader John Barilaro and the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, called for the upper house MP and former Nat Michael Johnsen to quit parliament, following reports alleging he sought to arrange for a sex worker to visit him in the state’s Parliament House. The Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, remained in self-isolation after developing cold-like symptoms. The first day of Labor’s national conference took place over Zoom, with the opposition unveiling a new manufacturing policy, and Anthony Albanese being introduced by former leader Bill Shorten. Scott Morrison’s new ministers were sworn in by the governor-general, also over Zoom. The Victorian government rejected a controversial AGL gas import terminal at Crib Point, in a win for environmental campaigners. We’ll see you tomorrow. With the Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, in self-isolation, his deputy, Nicole Manison, has been providing an update in Darwin. She says from 4.30pm NT time, the territory will declare Byron Bay a hotspot. It means anyone who is travelling to the NT from Byron Bay after 4.30pm will be required to go into mandatory supervised quarantine – at a cost of $2,500. Anyone now in the NT who was in Byron Bay after 26 March will also need to remain in self-isolation for 14 days. They must also get tested. People who have been in the Gold Coast are now in the NT who have cold-like symptoms should also self-isolate and get tested. AAP has this markets update at the close of play. Australia’s share market had a downbeat day as spikes in bond yields prompted investors to sell equities, while Brisbane’s growing coronavirus outbreak hit Easter travel plans. The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index closed down 61.1 points, or 0.9%, to 6,738.4 on Tuesday. The All Ordinaries closed lower by 66.6 points, or 0.95%, to 6,969.8. The indices rose early but soon moved lower, then extended losses. The heavyweight sectors of materials and health lost 1.88 and 1.05% respectively. There were notable losses for the smaller sectors of utilities and energy, down 1.77 and 1.56%. Deep Data Analytics chief executive Mathan Somasundaram said losses were to be expected nearing the end of the financial quarter, as fund managers tried to lock in profits. He also noted rises in US and Australian bond yields, which he said was part of the reflation trade. The Australian 10-year bond yield was 1.7%. Investors expect governments’ reflationary policies, which stimulate the economy by increasing money supply, to eventually lead to inflation. This has been particularly the case in the US, where investors expect strong economic recovery from the pandemic. Investors have already demanded better returns in the bond market. “If yields are higher, bonds become more attractive, which has the opposite effect on equities and other asset classes,” Somasundaram said. Domestically, Queensland tourism operators’ Easter trade has been hit by the unfolding virus outbreak. Authorities reported another eight infections have emerged, totalling 15 since the initial case last week. People in Brisbane are in their first full day of a three-day lockdown. IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda said while it was tempting to believe ASX losses may have been tied to the outbreak, higher yields were the cause. The Queensland doctors’ union has called for a full investigation into how a doctor and nurse at the same Brisbane hospital contracted coronavirus, leading to two separate clusters of community transmission and a city-wide lockdown. Ben Smee has the story. NSW Health has provided updated advice for venues visited by previously confirmed Queensland cases of Covid-19 who visited the Byron Bay area. The following are close contact venues. Anyone who attended the following venues at the times listed must immediately get tested and self-isolate for 14 days from the date they were at the venue, regardless of the result: Byron Bay: Beach Hotel, 1 Bay Street, Friday, 26 March, 7.15pm-9pm Ewingsdale: Three Blue Ducks restaurant – Terrace, 11 Ewingsdale Road, Sunday, 28 March, 8.45am-9.30am The following is a casual contact venue. If you have been to this location at the listed time, you should get tested immediately and isolate until a negative result is received. Continue to monitor for symptoms, and if they appear, get tested again: Ewingsdale: The Farm – any other area not listed above (including Poppy and Fern, Wormticklers and other sections of Three Blue Ducks) 11 Ewingsdale Road, Sunday, 28 March, 8.30am-10.30am NSW Health says: The fourteen people still in NSW have been directed by NSW Health to undergo a Covid-19 test and to self-isolate for 14 days, regardless of the result. These people will receive regular follow-up contact from NSW Health during this time. Liberal senator Amanda Stoker, who was among the Coalition women handed additional responsibilities in the recent Morrison government reshuffle, says she is not seeking to run in Andrew Laming’s seat at the next election. Some of Western Australia’s most vulnerable people are flocking to receive their coronavirus jabs as the rollout begins in remote Aboriginal communities, reports AAP. About 200 people were expected to be vaccinated on Tuesday in Beagle Bay, on the Dampier Peninsula in the state’s north. It is the first remote community in WA to receive the vaccines, which are being administered by Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Services. Medical director Lorraine Anderson says the successful start bodes well for keeping the virus out of vulnerable communities. “We’ve been blown away today by the enthusiasm of the community coming to be vaccinated, and especially the older people,” she told AAP. “There’s queues of people here wanting to get the vaccine. We’re really excited that people are accepting this vaccine as well as what they are today.” Tourists and travellers remain barred from entering more than 200 remote Aboriginal communities across WA as part of the state’s Covid-19 response. But the vaccination program remains a major safeguard for when access is eventually restored. “I think it’s fairly well-known that people in remote Aboriginal communities have a much higher rate of chronic disease, in particular diabetes and heart disease,” Anderson said. A thousand doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were delivered to Broome on Friday. KAMS reaches just over half the Aboriginal population in the Kimberley, and it’s aiming to vaccinate 90% of people in the remote communities it looks after. Health workers spent about eight weeks visiting remote communities to discuss the vaccine and address any concerns. The KAMS graphics team also went to work on translating the health department messaging to make it more accessible. Liberal MP Jason Falinski is on the ABC with Labor’s Peter Khalil, who has criticised the speed of the vaccine roll out. Falinksi says: I mean, you can say a lot about this federal government but to suggest that the vaccine rollout has not been well planned and well executed by the federal government is, I think, a total miscarriage of the facts that are in front of us. Khalil replies: This is your responsibility. The one thing that Morrison has actually claimed that they have full responsibility for can’t handball it off, fob it off, throw it to the states, it is your responsibility. You promised four million by the end of March and you have failed? OK? When will phase 1a be completed? Kelly says: On the phases, we are looking to complete the 1a in the coming weeks, and then by the middle of the year 1b will be completed. On reports AstraZeneca has been suspended for people under 55, Kelly says Australian authorities are “aware of it” and “looking at it closely”. But for the moment we are pushing ahead with that same AstraZeneca rollout, and that is our workhorse at the moment in our state and territory clinics. And that’s the end of the press conference. Should states have a unified response to outbreaks, and with the vaccine program rolling out, when will states chose to “stop closing their borders in response to outbreaks”? Kelly says: Firstly, as we have said all the way through the pandemic, the public health responses are a responsibility of the states and territories, they need to do what they see fit to protect the populations of their own states and territories. I would beg to differ about states and territories taking different responses. I am actually very much, I very much welcome what has been pretty much the same response all the way through in relation to the events in Brisbane over the last few days. Western Australia has gone a bit further than the others, and particularly in their geographic understanding of the hotspot being the whole of Queensland, but most of the rest of the states have been, have taken a similar approach to grated Brisbane. On the second question, he says there have been “very frank and productive conversations over the last couple of weeks in relation to how the vaccine rollout will assist us and modify responses to these sorts of outbreaks”. We are in a situation where we are as a higher risk as we have been since the beginning of the pandemic. We know as we mostly open and there are very few restrictions on our movement, on the things we can do as a society, that means that the outbreaks can spread quickly, and so that’s why that very strong public health response is absolutely crucial at the moment, and the more vaccine that gets out there, the more people that are protected, that will decrease the outbreaks in the spread over the coming months. Asked about reports of vaccine wastage, Kelly says “cold chain logistics is a challenge for any vaccination program” and says he’s aware of a “small number” instances but does not have figures on hand. First question to Kelly. Why is the vaccine rollout so slow? He says: We have a fantastic partnership with the states and territories and that is working very well and has done from the beginning, and I’m not going to call out any particular state or territory in this regard. We are working very closely together on this massive logistic exercise. I will make one point though, and I recognise that this has been said differently in other press conferences today, but from the beginning, we have been very clear from the commonwealth how much vaccine is coming in and how much is being distributed to the places where the vaccine can be given, including each state and territory. We have been very clear in relation to the Pfizer vaccine, because the second dose needs to be given is three weeks after the first, the commonwealth, as part of our responsibility. will be keeping a second dose available for every single person that gets a first dose. There is no need for a state or territory to be keeping any vaccine aside for that purpose, that is the commonwealth’s responsibility. Kelly says authorities “will be watching very carefully what happens in Brisbane over the coming days and indeed in northern New South Wales”, because there were confirmed cases that also visited that area. Kelly says: Two clusters have been identified in the community in Queensland. There has been eight cases in the second cluster and they are both related to the B1 17 variant, the so-called UK strain which we know isa variant of concern and is more transmissible in the community. We also know that they are likely to be two quite separate incursions of this into the Brisbane community and so at this stage they are not connected outbreaks. Numerous locations have been visited by cases during their infectious period including locations in Gladstone, Moreton Bay regional city council, Byron Bay and Toowoomba. Due to this increased risk posed by the B1 17 variant and the variance of cases that have been in the community while infectious over a number of days and other factors indicating the risk of transmission, this is proportionate to the change in circumstances and the commonwealth has offered therefore the Queensland government support and assistance as is the case with a hotspot declaration. The chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly has stepped up. He says that he is declaring greater Brisbane area a Covid-19 hotspot for the purposes of commonwealth support. This is quite a statistic. We are expecting an update from the chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, shortly. Today’s development that the Victorian government has blocked AGL’s gas terminal at Crib Point is not the only news coming out of the energy company today. As AAP reports, AGL today confirmed it wants to split its business in two as it comes under increasing pressure to move to clean energy. AGL, which has traded for more than 180 years, on Tuesday unveiled plans for a “New AGL” business focused on low carbon-emitting technologies offering consumers electricity, gas, internet and mobile services. The other business – dubbed PrimeCo – would continue operating its coal-fired power stations to generate electricity. AGL has the coal-fired Bayswater and Liddell power stations in NSW, and Loy Yang stations in Victoria. The gas-fired power station on Torrens Island, South Australia, has also been controversial for its environmental impact. There are plans to build grid-scale batteries at each site, which will provide clean energy. PrimeCo would mostly serve wholesale and industrial customers, and be less consumer-focused. The chief executive Brett Redman said concerns about climate change, shifts in government policy and cheaper technology had changed the electricity market. He said structural separation would give each business the freedom to execute its own strategies. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility’s Dan Gocher was sceptical of the proposal. He said any responsible investor would surely avoid PrimeCo, due to its coal-fired power stations. “The demerger does nothing to reduce emissions, but it may appease some institutional investors who have been demanding AGL do something to reduce its carbon exposure,” he said. The splitting of the business will need shareholders and regulators to approve. The Greens are blaming the Queensland lockdown on the slow vaccine rollout and, therefore, also blaming the Morrison government. In a statement, the party’s Senate leader Larissa Waters said: The people of Brisbane and Queensland can thank the Morrison government for this lockdown. The PM promised us that four million Australians would be vaccinated by early April. But with two days until April less than 15% of that number – 550,000 people – have received a dose. In Queensland that number is only 65,000. The PM must explain why there are still unvaccinated frontline healthcare workers treating Covid patients in Queensland hospitals. Not only has this government failed the people of Queensland and Australia with its flawed vaccine rollout, it’s abandoned businesses and workers by pulling away the safety nets that have allowed hundreds of thousands to remain employed and kept millions above the poverty line. By ending jobkeeper the government consigned 150,000 to unemployment nationally, right at the time when the jobseeker unemployment benefit is being slashed to $43.57 a day. The Brisbane lockdown will guarantee that more people will be forced out of work and into poverty. It’s unconscionable that this government can leave thousands of businesses and millions of workers to fend for themselves knowing full well that their failure to bring Covid under control leaves them vulnerable. A floods update from AAP: A handful or residents in Sydney’s north-west are still awaiting the all clear to return home more than a week after being ordered to evacuate amid major flooding. Large tracts of NSW went under water over the past two weeks as rivers filled by torrential rain broke their banks. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from homes across the state, with Sydney’s Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley and the mid-north coast the hardest hit. As the cleanup from the widespread flood continues in earnest, evacuation orders remain in place for four areas along the Hawkesbury River. Residents living in parts of Pitt Town Bottoms, Cornwallis, Freemans Reach and Pitt Town North are still waiting for the State Emergency Service to allow them to return after evacuating on 21 March. A sewage spill has also kept some people from returning home in Stuarts Point, near Nambucca Heads on the NSW mid north coast. An evacuation order was issued on 26 March, after septic systems overflowed into yards and streets, impacting 45 homes, police say. NSW Health deemed there to be a health risk from faecal matter and bacteria in the discharge. Impacted streets have now dried out and been disinfected, and all roads are open again. Individual homes are still part of the exclusion zone however, with authorities assessing them before people are allowed to return.

South Australia has recorded no new community cases of Covid-19, with the three infections detected over the past 24 hours contained in medi-hotels. As we noted earlier, the New South Wales deputy premier, John Barilaro, has called for upper Hunter MP Michael Johnsen to immediately resign from parliament following reports alleging he sought to arrange for a sex worker to visit him in the state’s Parliament House. For more details, my colleague Michael McGowan has filed this report. The Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, remains in Covid-19 self-isolation after coming into contact with family members visiting from Queensland and developing cold-like symptoms, reports AAP. Gunner’s family arrived in Darwin from Toowoomba on Friday, a week after a man infected with the UK strain of the virus started moving about the state’s south-east. “He’s at home isolating waiting for his Covid test results to come back,” the NT deputy chief minister, Nicole Manison, told reporters on Tuesday. “The advice from the chief health officer is that the risk is very low.” The NT declared Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan, the Toowoomba region, the Moreton Bay region and Redland hotspots from 4.30pm on Monday. Another eight coronavirus cases emerged overnight in greater Brisbane, which was locked down for three days at 5pm on Monday to slow infection rates. Gunner went into self-isolation late on the same day after calling into an NT’s Covid-19 state emergency management committee meeting from another office at NT Parliament House. “Some family members arrived and he’s got some minor cold-type symptoms and he’s doing the right thing and taking extra precaution here,” Manison told reporters on Monday afternoon. Manison said Mr Gunner’s family members were also self-isolating and would be tested for the virus. “Clearly there’s a risk. I think the risk is really small but the fact the chief has some symptoms it’s very appropriate to go and get a test,” the NT chief health officer, Hugh Heggie, said. Manison said she did not know when the chief minister’s Covid-19 test results would be made public. I won’t go through the new ministry again, but the new ministers have now been sworn in. Morrison and Hurley have just taken a photo with the new ministers, which is to say they stood on either side of a large TV screen, where the ministers’ faces were visible on Zoom. And that’s that. Christian Porter, who has been shifted from attorney general to minister for science and industry, has been sworn in. It is the first time Porter has appeared publicly since he took mental health leave. For those wondering, the oath is: I, Charles Christian Porter, do swear that I will well and truly serve the people of Australia in the office of minister for industry, for science and to and that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, so help me God. Linda Reynolds also appeared for the first time since she took leave for health reasons. Scott Morrison is currently sitting down with the governor general, David Hurley, to present his new ministry. The swearing in is taking place online, meaning the new ministers are hoping up their signature to their computer screen after taking the oath. It’s all a bit weird, but so are the times, I guess. This is from AAP. The Australian Academy of Science has apologised for welcoming incoming minister Christian Porter to the portfolio after copping widespread backlash. The organisation of Australia’s top research scientists has backtracked on an initial statement, which read: “We look forward to working with incoming Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Christian Porter.” It described the tweet as “poorly worded” after dozens of people replied by raising historic rape allegations against Porter, which he strenuously denies. “We apologise. We are deeply aware of the challenging circumstances created by the reshuffle. We will always work to advance science in Australia for all,” the academy said on Tuesday. The backlash highlights ongoing problems plaguing Scott Morrison after rejigging his frontbench lineup. Porter has been demoted as attorney general but will remain in cabinet. Linda Reynolds will also stay on the frontbench – moving from defence to government services – despite mishandling rape allegations raised by former staffer Brittany Higgins. Morrison has used a cabinet reshuffle to try and lift his government out of a crisis over the treatment of women. The number of women in cabinet has been restored to seven and a new ministerial task force has been established to deal with women’s equality, safety and economic security. The prime minister and governor general David Hurley will attend a swearing-in ceremony in Canberra on Tuesday, while ministers gaining new roles will appear via video conference. AGL’s chief executive, Brett Redman, has responded to the Victorian government’s decision to reject the company’s proposal for a new gas terminal and pipeline at Crib Point off the Mornington Peninsula because it would have unacceptable impacts on the environment. At an investor briefing on Tuesday, Redman said the government told the company it was blocking the project based on the recommendations of an independent review by an inquiry and advisory committee. Redman said: As you can appreciate, it’s quite a complex decision, we were given a copy late last night, the team is still pulling it apart to understand it. I’m not really in a position therefore to talk to it directly today beyond acknowledging the decision of the minister, and the detail that has come out that we need to consider properly. He told investors that in the context of AGL’s broader gas portfolio, the project was one proposal among “many sources of supply”. “I note that in this financial year alone, in the last nine months, we’ve signed around 150 petajoules of new supply arrangements, and that’s in this financial year alone,” Redman said. “So, while I had been hoping to have made a seventh announcement today, clearly we will be satisfied with six for the moment, and the seventh we still need to understand properly.” Apple will allow independent repairers in Australia and New Zealand to sign up to a new program this week that will provide access to its tools and spare parts, as the company faces heat on the right to repair. Josh Taylor has more. Long-serving South Australian Greens MP Mark Parnell will quit parliament early after previously announcing plans not to contest the state election in March next year, reports AAP. Parnell has served in the upper house for more than 15 years, but says he will retire from politics next week. The Greens recently chose former senator Robert Simms to be the party’s lead candidate at the state poll, giving him a strong chance of being elected to the Legislative Council. Simms will now be named as the party’s nominee to fill the casual vacancy caused by Mr Parnell’s decision. “As I won’t be re-contesting the next election, it makes sense to give Rob an opportunity to make his mark in state parliament and to become more familiar with key state issues before the election next year,” Parnell said on Tuesday. Hello everyone, Luke Henriques-Gomes here. Thanks to Matilda Boseley for her excellent work steering the ship. I’ll be with you for the afternoon. You can get in touch by email via luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or on Twitter at @lukehgomes. Let’s get into it. And with that, I will hand you over to Luke Henriques-Gomes, who will guide you through the afternoon. Victoria’s latest round of $200 travel vouchers was snapped up in three minutes, AAP reports. The 50,000 vouchers for travel in regional Victoria were released on Tuesday morning. It is the largest release of the vouchers, with 200,000 now taken up by Victorians. The website crashed when the first batch was released last December. “It’s quite it’s quite extraordinary how quick, whether it’s the 40,000 we had allocated for greater Melbourne or all the rounds of vouchers for regional Victoria – they just go like that,” said acting premier James Merlino. The scheme was launched to boost the local tourism sector, which was ravaged by the state’s Covid-19 lockdowns. Each of the latest vouchers involves $400 being spent on accommodation, tours or attractions in Victoria between 6-31 May. If you are playing the blog drinking game (which I’ve just made up) it’s time to take a shot because Annastacia Palaszczuk has once again delivered some truly baffling graphic design choices on Twitter. I beg you, if the premier’s social media person is reading this right now, please message me. I need to know if she demands these or if you have just gone totally rogue. We knew this already but no new local cases in NSW over night! The amazing Amy Remeikis is doing the Lord’s work and is liveblogging the ALP national conference, something I have neither the know-how or the patience to do. And, most amazingly, she is making it really interesting. Check it out here: The Victorian government has rejected AGL’s proposal for a gas import terminal in Western Port in the state’s south because of unacceptable impacts it would have on the environment, including internationally significant wetlands. AGL had proposed constructing a terminal at Crib Point off the Mornington Peninsula and building a pipeline from the terminal to Pakenham. The proposal had attracted fierce opposition from local councils, community and environment groups, the local federal MP, Greg Hunt, and the Victorian Liberal and National parties. On Tuesday, the state’s planning minister, Richard Wynne, said the government had concluded that marine discharge from the project would have unacceptable effects on the environment of Western Port, which is listed under the Ramsar convention as an internationally significant wetland. He said his decision was based on both AGL’s environment effects statement and an independent review by an inquiry and advisory committee that had received more than 6,000 submissions. This has been an exhaustive, open and transparent process and this is the right outcome for the local community, the environment and Victoria as a whole ... It’s very clear to me that this project would cause unacceptable impacts on the Western Port environment and the Ramsar wetlands – it’s important that these areas are protected. The South Australian government had denied using state websites to collect and track data for the Liberal party, reports AAP. Recent media reports suggested people accessing government websites were being redirected through a data harvesting platform called NationBuilder. But premier Steven Marshall said in a statement on Tuesday there had never been any retention of information. No data is being collected or retained when clicking on the links referred to in media reports... As NationBuilder has confirmed this morning, ‘this URL is not redirecting any users to NationBuilder’s platform – it is a reference link generated by Mimecast, a website analytics provider and no data is being collected or retained when users click on these links. Marshall said it was likely that when parts of media releases were copied and pasted into SA government websites, the original links were still being detected by Mimecast. The premier said to ensure there was no confusion among journalists or members of the public, the government would now use a different system for distributing media releases. But the Labor opposition called for an independent inquiry into the issue. Government accountability spokesman Tom Koutsantonis said South Australians turned to government websites for trusted information and had every right to ask what was happening to their personal data. Albanese: We are going to invest in Australian workers and Australian skills, a new era of national reconstruction to achieve our potential, a country that makes things and creates better jobs to go with them. Victory over the pandemic followed by victory for those whose sacrifices made it possible. This new platform that will be considered by our delegates reflects many things that I know to be true – my unwavering belief in Australians, my respect for the frontline workers, underpaid and undervalued, who endured so much to keep our country safe, the nurses, the aged care workers, the childcare workers, the retail workers, the cleaners, the truckies, the public servants and those in emergency services and more. I am determined to repay them with a better future, but words, of course, aren’t enough. So let’s win the next election and give Australians a government that’s on their side, a government that believes in their capacity to build a stronger, more secure nation. Anthony Albanese is going hard on the election pitch, and is also speaking in extremely long sentences: Unlike [the Liberals], we refuse to accept that the world before the pandemic, with all its imperfections, is the best our nation can do, because the pandemic laid bare some unacceptable truths, about an aged care system in crisis, about millions of Australians in jobs that simply aren’t safe or secure, millions more in jobs that don’t pay enough or have enough hours, women’s voices going unheard, a voice for First Nations people being denied, and the realities of climate change being ignored. A government so addicted to marketing spin that it is now spinning itself and the country into the ground. They have no plan for the future, none. My question for the country is this: after such a year of sacrifice, is this all they can offer us in return? Labor will offer more. We will say to Australians, we are on your side. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese is speaking now at the ALP conference in Sydney. He will officially launch his proposed $15bn kitty to drive pandemic recovery and bring manufacturing jobs back home. I have the feeling this is going to be very dull but I shall bring you the best bits. Reports are emerging from Hobart that next year’s controversial arts festival Dark Mofo may not go ahead. The Mercury is reporting that following the furore caused by Spanish artist Santiago Sierra – who was calling for First Nations people to donate their blood into which a Union Jack flag was to be immersed – the festival’s organisers, the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA), are pulling the plug for the 2022 event and replacing it with an all-Indigenous event called Blak Mofo. Authorities from the museum and festival have yet to confirm the rumours, which the Mercury says were outlined in an email sent to staff on Monday. The Guardian is seeking comment from MONA owner David Walsh and Dark Mofo creative director Leigh Carmichael. One point from that press conference that’s worth highlighting again is one of the five new cases from the Byron Bay hen’s cases was a man who has since visited an aged care home in the Gold Coast. He was reportedly the entertainer at the party. Palasczcuk says all residents of the home had been vaccinated with at least one dose, but the staff had not: One of the positive cases in that second cluster attended the hen’s party as an entertainer. And he came back and he lives in the Gold Coast and he works as a tradie, and he did go to an aged care facility in the Gold Coast. But every resident in that aged care facility has already been vaccinated, had their first dose. I haven’t got confirmation about whether any have received their second dose. He’s one of those five [new cases from the nurse cluster]. So, we’re working with the commonwealth to respond to that aged care facility. The team down at the Gold Coast are organising to go to the facility today and vaccinate the staff of that facility. News from South Australia: Australians stranded overseas due to strict caps on quarantine spaces have filed a petition against the Australian government to the United Nations’ human rights committee in Geneva. The group StrandedAussies.org is claiming that Australian government has “arbitrarily breached their right to return to the land of their birth or citizenship”, and that the caps on incoming flights have prevented them from returning, despite the fact that they are willing to comply with all necessary public health measures, including 14 days’ quarantine in Australia. Their petitions also point out that Australia has breached the UN’s international covenant because they have no effective remedy – they cannot go to court to require the government to live up to its obligations to permit its citizens to return home. The action is backed by constitutional law Professor Kim Rubenstein, who has provided evidence, as well as Geoffrey Robertson QC, who has given legal advice to the petitioners. Robertson said: International law recognises the strong bond between individuals and their homeland and no respectable government would impose travel caps to prevent, for over a year, its citizens from returning if they are prepared to do quarantine. Both our political parties have, in the past, done what they can to help Australians overseas but Mr Morrison is behaving as if in a moral vacuum – he does not seem to care very much about the suffering caused to fellow Australians. More than 36,000 Australians remain stranded overseas as a result of the arrival caps – limits requested by state and territory governments to ease pressure on their quarantine facilities that the commonwealth government, which manages international borders, mandates. Labor have called for the government to introduce more commonwealth quarantine facilities to help boost capacity for Australians to return. The Australian National Audit Office is currently examining the caps as part of its audit of the international border management during Covid, while constitutional law experts first raised concerns about the caps in August. Arrival caps have also proved controversial in other countries. Earlier this month, Israel’s high court annulled its government’s daily arrival cap of 3,000 – far larger than Australia’s intake – ruling it was unconstitutional as it was disproportionate and violated the country’s civil rights. The next thing to figure out is what happened with health worker vaccination. Some are blaming the federal government for not rolling out the vaccine fast enough; others are blaming the state government for not prioritising health workers. Here is what we heard today from the state government: Chief health officer Jeannette Young says it was always the plan that once all frontline health workers were vaccinated THEN the state would dictate that only vaccinated workers could interact with Covid-19 positive patients. This is set to come into effect tomorrow when the first dose vaccinations are completed. About 89% of frontline health workers are vaccinated now. The infected/unvaccinated nurse did work on Covid-19 wards BUT it’s not believed this is where she picked it up. Young says she was infected on 23 March during a shift where she had no direct contact with infected people, which means another hospital worker could have had the virus and spread it from a traveller to her. The nurse wasn’t vaccinated yet as she was on leave. Young says because of the boom in infected returned travellers they had too many Covid-19 positive people in hospital to only use staff who had had a vaccine dose. Queensland health minister Yvette D’Arth blamed the slow vaccination of healthcare workers on the slow and stuttering supply of vaccine doses from the federal government. She says they couldn’t use all the Pfizer vaccine doses they were given because they had to save half, as there was uncertainty on if the second dose would be delivered from overseas. OK so let’s break down what we just learned: There are eight new locally acquired cases of the UK variant of coronavirus: five of those active cases are definitely linked to a known cluster, one active case that’s probably linked, and two historical cases that are likely linked to the old cluster. Rather than there being one large cluster, as was suspected yesterday, there is actually two totally distinct clusters both starting at the Princess Alexandria Hospital in Brisbane. We will call them the “doctor cluster” and the “nurse cluster” for now. Doctor cluster – likely seven cases (not including original traveller): The first person in this cluster was a doctor at the Princess Alexandria Hospital who was diagnosed in early March. It was originally thought she did not infect anyone. A man in Stafford was diagnosed last Friday and it’s believed he infected a man in Strathpine. The brother of one of these two men was found to be a historical case. He is no longer infectious but is believed to be the missing link between this cluster and the doctor. Two of the the Strathpine man’s workmates were diagnosed on Monday, including one who travelled in Gladstone while infected. On Tuesday two more historical cases were discovered and are believed to be linked to this cluster. Nurse cluster – likely seven cases (not including original traveller): An unvaccinated nurse was infected while at work and had the exact same genomic sequences as a traveller from India who was admitted to the hospital on 22 March. She worked in the Covid-19 ward on 18 March but is NOT believed to have contracted it then. She then worked on 23 March in a non-Covid-19 ward. She is believed to have been infected that night but they do not know how yet. Another worker may have been infected by the traveller and then infected her. She then infected her sister. Before they knew they had Covid-19 but while infectious they travelled to Byron Bay, reportedly for a hen’s night. Five other attendees at the Byron Bay party have now been infected. One of those infected was a male entertainer who works as a tradie on the Gold Coast. He visited a Gold Cost aged care home afterwards, but all residents had been vaccinated with at least one dose. All have returned to Queensland, one may be in Hervey Bay. One other case – There is one other local case. They are definitely a close contact to another case but they aren’t sure which cluster they belong to yet. (Go figure!) Chief health officer Jeannette Young says there may be a case in Hervey Bay related to the nurse cluster: There’s a case in the Hervey Bay area that we’re just looking at, at the moment. There may or may not be an issue there, but we’re looking at it ... That’s one of the cases related to the second cluster. Queensland deputy police commissioner Doug Smith says while no fine has been handed out, one man was arrested in part due to Covid-19 infractions: We’ve seen one arrest related to Covid but that person was intercepted for serious criminal offences and during the arrest, decided to cough on police and has been charged with a serious assault as a result of that ... A number of intercepts, street checks and the like. No fines have been handed out and all of the concerns so far have been reports of people coming out of affected areas and checking on them. In all instance, no reports of parties. We’ve handed out 216 masks to date and we’ll continue to do that and we’ll work with the community to make sure that they continue to do the right thing. Yvette D’Ath says the infected nurse hadn’t been vaccinated as she was on leave: Inevitably, there will be staff who were on leave and this nurse at the PA had actually been on leave for a month was due to get her vaccine this week. So there is always going to be those on leave, who are sick and for other reasons, hadn’t come forward and got vaccinated yet. And we are identifying all of those people now so we can get them vaccinated, but irrespective of whether they’re vaccinated or not, we’ll get to that point as of tomorrow that we have to use only vaccinated staff. Queensland health minister Yvette D’Ath has taken a gentle swing at the federal government, aiming to push the blame for unvaccinated healthcare workers back on the slow national vaccine rollout, rather than decisions made by the state: In relation to the vaccine, first of all, the amount of vaccine that we have been supplied by the commonwealth did not all arrive on the first day. So it has progressively increased, just as our vaccinations have progressively increased. In fact, we did 6,004 vaccinations yesterday, so that is a record number of vaccinations and we’ve done 65,129 now. So 65,129 as of yesterday. So every day, we’re increasing the vaccinations, but, we had to wait for consistency of supply. Also remember, we also had to keep some in reserve for the second vaccination because particularly around Pfizer, so the majority of all of our 1as, this the Pfizer. So certainly in the six major hubs, they all got Pfizer. We have to hold back enough Pfizer to give them their second vaccination because we can’t be sure and even the commonwealth can’t be sure when that Pfizer delivery is goings to come to Australia, and also when it is going to get out to the individual states ... Until we get the CSL AstraZeneca out to every state on a weekly basis, we have to be careful to make sure that we manage the vaccines. Young has defended the state’s vaccine rollout program for health workers. (It’s interesting to note that the nurse wasn’t working directly on the Covid-19 ward the night it’s believed she was infected, as was previously assumed. However non-vaccinated workers were still allowed on the ward generally.) Young says all frontline health workers will be vaccinated in the next 48 hours: So, as of tomorrow, I will mandate, as I have been saying now for several weeks to the hospital and health services, that only people who have had their first dose of the vaccine, whether it be Pfizer or AstraZeneca, can work directly with confirmed cases of Covid, and that was always our plan. So, we did set ourselves that target for between four and six weeks to get all of 1a workers vaccinated. We’ve reached that. We believe we’ll have finished that by tomorrow. And then the plan was always, once we had people vaccinated, because we needed to have people available to look after all these cases. As you heard earlier, we’ve gone very, very rapidly from five cases in just over a month to 78. So, we need staff to look after these cases. And I’m very grateful to the staff who have been doing this work ... And now all of those staff will have had the opportunity to be vaccinated, so it will be mandated that only vaccinated staff can work directly with Covid-positive cases. All these clusters are a bit confusing but Young has broken it down a bit: I have initially got three cases related to the PA doctor back earlier in March [the doctor cluster]. Right? Then I’ve got an additional five cases that are confirmed that are related to that cluster [the doctor cluster]. Then I have got two more cases that I’m investigating that I suspect are related to that cluster, right? So, that’s one cluster. [These are the two historic cases, likely linked to the doctor cluster.] Then my second cluster, I’ve got seven confirmed cases related to that cluster [the nurse cluster]. Plus, of course, the original case who travelled from India that has led to that cluster. So, one plus seven. Then I’ve got another case that’s one or the other cluster. Personally, I’m still confused. I’ll bring you a simpler version as soon as the presser is over. Young says she doesn’t know which cluster that last community transmission case is linked to but she does know they are a close contact of a previous case. It sounds like all the information gathering for this press conference was pretty down to the line. Young says the two cases under investigation are historic cases that are likely linked to the older “Doctor cluster”: So, there are two cases that I believe at this stage – but I do need more confirmation – are linked to the first cluster. And they are positive on serology ... So we’ve just got to do some more work on those two cases. They’re PCR-negative, so they are not currently infectious, but they are reactive on serology and they are close contacts of people involved in the first cluster. Young: Then there are a further five cases that I’ve been informed of overnight linked to that nurse or her sister. So, they’re all linked cases, and they all attended a party together down in Byron Bay. So, we’re just working through all of those specific details. This is very recent information. So, we have those five cases linked to that nurse, so we now have seven in that cluster. Young says it’s believed the Covid-19 positive nurse she announced yesterday acquired Covid-19 while at work: The first cluster is related to that doctor at the PA Hospital who treated a confirmed case. And you would remember that she acquired it from a confirmed case in the hospital, and also that case had passed it on to another traveller in the hotel when they were in hotel quarantine. So, there were those three cases earlier [in] March. Then since then we now have these new cases that we picked up in the community. And I’m very grateful to that first young man who came forward and got tested, and the second gentleman – so, they live in northern Brisbane – so, those two cases. Then we’ve had other cases connected to those. And we know they’re all linked because of the genome sequence. They’re all a B117 linked back to that case at the PA Hospital. Then we have a second cluster, and this is the nurse that I told you about yesterday. So, she worked at the PA Hospital on 18 March in the Covid ward. But we now have the genome sequence result back ... she has exactly the same genome ... to a gentleman who arrived and was treated in the PA Hospital and was tested on 22 March. So, after the nurse worked in the Covid ward, she did do a shift on the night of 23 March, so that shift started 10pm that night, she worked through the night into the next day on the 24th. So, my hypothesis ... is that she has acquired the infection when at work that night. Now, I don’t know whether she’s got it directly from that patient, because she wasn’t working with Covid cases that night, but we have to confirm that, or whether she’s got it from someone else in the hospital. Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young says the two cases under investigation are likely linked to the older cluster: So, we’ve had 10 new cases overnight. Six of them are locally acquired cases. Five of them related to the second cluster ... One, we’re still working out which cluster they’re related to, but we know they are a contact of a case. So, we have six linked locally acquired cases, which is good – they’re all linked. Then we have two cases that were acquired overseas and detected in hotel quarantine. So, both came from the Philippines via Papua New Guinea into Queensland. So, they’re fine and being managed. Then we have two other cases that are under investigation, so we’re just working through those cases. We believe they’re older cases linked to the first cluster. Palaszczuk: The good news is that these cases are linked and we now believe that there are two distinct clusters. So, we have a cluster linked, of course, to that PA doctor. And we have a second cluster linked to the PA nurse. So, close contacts of both of those clusters. And Dr Young will go into more details. No words yet on how those two under investigation cases are linked to these clusters. Annastacia Palaszczuk is speaking now: I can report that we have 10 new cases overnight. Now, eight of these are community acquired cases. Six are close contacts of confirmed cases. And two are currently under investigation, but we believe that they are also linked to the two people. So, two are also overseas-acquired, and once again coming via Papua New Guinea. Criminal charges against the missing Sydney conwoman Melissa Caddick will be dropped by the corporate watchdog, five weeks after her badly decomposed foot washed up on a beach. A warrant for the 49-year-old’s arrest had been issued on behalf of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, which had laid almost 40 charges against Caddick. The charges will be formally withdrawn in Sydney’s Downing Centre local court on Tuesday. The fraudster went missing last November, a day after Asic executed a search warrant at her eastern Sydney home. You can read the full report below: Victoria reports no new Covid cases We are standing by now to get a Covid-19 update from Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. That’s due to start any moment. Foreign affairs minister and, as Scott Morrison said yesterday the new “prime minister for women” Marise Payne has spoken to Sydney radio station 2GB this morning. She was asked for her reaction to reports that NSW state nationals MP Michael Johnsen had allegedly sought to arrange for a sex worker to visit him in Parliament House. Johnsen stepped aside from his position as a parliamentary secretary and moved to the crossbench after it was revealed he was the subject of a six-month police investigation into rape allegations made by the same sex worker. It is completely, absolutely, utterly inappropriate, and it is deeply, deeply distressing for many of us who work and have an enormous respect for the role that we’ve held for so many years ... We as parliamentarians have to own the problems, have to own the failings, and frankly, we must own the solutions because if we don’t, it won’t change and that’s our obligation. But despite talking about owning solutions, the minister for women didn’t seem too open to the “solution” to the “federal Liberal MP Andrew Laming problem” that many are calling for. Laming has been accused of harassing two women online and “upskirting” another. He has said he will not contest the next election but the Liberal party has not asked him to move to the crossbench or resign from parliament, a move that would plunge the government into minority. Radio host Ben Fordham asked if Payne was comfortable with him retaining his roll with a salaray of “more than $200,000 a year”: Well, importantly, he has taken responsibility for his actions and there are two things that are happening as a result of that. The first is that he is [has] been taking time to do the sorts of training and instruction, and awareness-raising that frankly should have been in place before, and that is something that he has decided to do of his own volition, and he should. Secondly, he has indicated that he has taken a very serious decision to leave parliament at the completion of [his term]. He’s been elected by the people of Bowman, they made that decision, they’ll serve out his term, and then he leaves the parliament. I think that that is the response to these behaviours but importantly, I hope it shows that others would seek to engage in this sort of activity that is completely unacceptable and that it must change. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese is speaking now about Labor proposed policy to bring manufacturing back to Australia if elected: Australians making sacrifices to look after each other is seeing us through the pandemic, but it’s also shown up some of the weaknesses in our economy. The fact that we’re not resilient enough, that we’re susceptible to shocks, the fact that we didn’t have enough PPE, we didn’t have enough ventilators, there’s a whole range of products that we’re simply not producing ... [The] Australia’s national reconstruction fund that Labor would create, of $15bn, to partner with the private sector, including superannuation funds, will drive future jobs growth and our economy. It will be particularly beneficial for our regions. It will apply to sectors across the board, such as defence industry, such as existing businesses that need to transition towards zero net emissions. It will be an important tool going forward to build confidence in our economy. We know that investment is actually going backwards, that we’re not seeing enough business investment in this country. And we also know that Australia has been fantastic at research and innovation, everything from new solar energy technology through to wine casks, through to wi-fi... It’s a part of Labor’s focus on jobs, which will be the centre of our recovery. You can read more here: Over the past year, various members of the Redfern Shanty Club found different ways to cope. Robert Boddington, with his thespian’s voice and easy stage patter, gathered a few friends and tried to sing in public places, “just turning up in the dead of night and quietly singing away”. Robin Howard says he got “the shakes”. Emma Norton, a train driver with a soaring Celtic voice, says: “I sang to myself a lot, I guess.” On Monday night, as restrictions in Sydney were almost completely lifted – with relaxed caps on capacity in bars, and no limits on singing – this devoted and joyous community finally returned to their favourite weekly ritual. The sea shanty night, which operates out of the Dock bar in Redfern, was put on hold early last year. It had been running for seven years, after being started by the Sydney comedian Carlo Ritchie, who Boddington says “used to sing in Berlin with some mates over a roast dinner on Mondays”, and brought the idea back home. You can read Naaman’s full (very entertaining) story below: The nation’s stocks of blood after running low after widespread, record-breaking floods across NSW saw a drop in donations, reports Tiffanie Turnbull from AAP. The Australian Red Cross is calling for more people to roll up their sleeves ahead of the Easter weekend, with O-negative bloods donors in particular need. O-negative is particularly important over the Easter period when supplies are often challenged, Lifeblood executive director Cath Stone said in a statement: O-negative is the universal blood type and can be given to anyone in an emergency, such as a road trauma, when there simply isn’t time to find out someone’s blood type ... Only 9% of Australians have O-negative blood, but it makes up 17% of orders from hospitals because it saves lives in emergencies. An extra 8,000 donations are needed to boost stocks back to normal levels. We understand so much has been asked of Australians over the last 12 months, from bushfires, to the pandemic and now floods ... While we’ve appealed for donors multiple times already this year, the number of people responding simply isn’t meeting patient demand. Berejiklian has flagged the possibility of stricter Covid-19 restrictions in NSW if cases are discovered. If you’ve attended any of the venues in New South Wales which New South Wales Health has identified, get tested, stay home and isolate for the full 14 days and, as Dr Chant said, we also expect you to take a second test towards the end of your isolation period to make sure you haven’t developed the disease or been diagnosed in the meantime ... This all is all to keep the broader community in New South Wales safe. This is to make sure that we do everything we can to not unnecessarily burden our citizenships. We want to continue the path that we’re on in New South Wales. But I want to say the situation is evolving and if cases are identified in New South Wales, we will have to respond. I’m hoping it doesn’t come to that but, given that we did have two infected people at a number of venues in New South Wales, we should brace ourselves. NSW is on high alert after two of the Covid-19 positive people in the Queensland cluster visited Byron Bay while infectious. Gladys Berejiklian says there are no cases identified in the state so far but has urged people to renew their hygiene efforts. We’re asking everybody to be alert, to make sure you get tested if you have the mildest of symptoms and, of course, if you’ve been to Brisbane since 20 March, please make sure you continue to update yourself on the venues which the Queensland government have stated have been attended by infected persons. Please also make sure that if you returned to New South Wales [from] Brisbane, that you comply with whatever lockdown provisions are in place in Brisbane. If you’ve come back since 20 March and the Queensland government said that Brisbane residents have to be in lockdown for three days, you hve to follow that here in New South Wales, but for those exemptions that are available. I hope that we do not have any cases arise in New South Wales but I would not be surprised if we did, so we must brace ourselves. The New South Wales government is confident that we have provisions in place to get on top of it if any cases are revealed. Dr Chant is in regular contact with Queensland authorities and she will be able to provide an update on those conversations but suffice to say we are expecting more cases from Queensland and hopefully most of those cases will be people in isolation although we have to assume this is an evolving situation. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian is speaking now. Michael McGowan has more on that news from NSW: The New South Wales deputy premier and leader of the Nationals, John Barilaro, has called for Upper Hunter MP Michael Johnsen to immediately resign following reports in the ABC claiming he had sought to arrange for a sex worker to visit him in Parliament House. Johnsen is a Nationals MP who stepped aside from his position as a parliamentary secretary and moved to the crossbench after it was revealed he was the subject of a six-month police investigation into rape allegations made by a sex worker. On Tuesday the ABC reported Johnsen had offered the woman $1,000 to attend NSW parliament for sex, as well as sending the woman a string of lewd text messages and an obscene video while parliament was sitting. Responding to the reports, Barilaro said he had contacted Johnsen on Tuesday morning and “expressed the view that his position as member of parliament is untenable”. This is disgusting behaviour and will never be acceptable, nor should it be and I’m calling for him to resign from parliament immediately ... It is now up to Mr Johnsen to reconsider his position as an independent member of parliament.” Also responding to the reports, the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said the reports were “beyond disgusting”. If that’s correct I’m absolutely disgusted ... For many women in public life we know challenges that exist, but when colleagues and former colleagues do that type of thing it’s beyond disgusting. I want people, not just in politics but in all spheres of life, to be respectful of women and treat them equally. Johnsen stood aside from his position as a parliamentary secretary and moved to the crossbench after the Labor MP Trish Doyle used parliamentary privilege to claim that an unnamed member had allegedly sexually assaulted a sex worker. He released a statement saying he was “devastated” by the allegations, and that he was “confident any investigation will conclude that I am an innocent party”. I have voluntarily spoken with NSW police and I have and will continue to fully cooperate with their inquiries. I am confident any investigation will conclude that I am an innocent party. Johnsen said “as the matter is with the NSW police I will make no further public comment”. NSW Nationals leader and deputy premier John Barilaro has called on MP Michael Johnsen to resign from parliament immediately. This came after an ABC report alleged he paid a sex worker $1,000 to come to parliament for sex and sent the woman lewd text messages and an obscene video while he was sitting in the parliamentary chamber. The report comes a week after the Upper Hunter MP went on leave and moved to the crossbench after denying allegations he raped the same woman at the Blue Mountains in 2019. This morning Barilaro released this statement: There is currently a police investigation under way which we must let proceed without prejudice. In light of this investigation, last week Michael Johnsen was removed from the Nationals and Coalition party rooms and suspended from the National party. Following reports this morning I contacted Mr Johnsen to express the view that his position as a member of parliament is untenable. This is disgusting behaviour and will never be acceptable, nor should it be, and I’m calling for Mr Johnsen to resign from parliament immediately. It is now up to Mr Johnsen to reconsider his position as an independent member of parliament. With a lockdown in Brisbane and fears in NSW over two of the infectious people travelling through Byron Bay, testing around the country has ramped up. In the ACT there aren’t that many testing clinics still operating, given the territory has had approximately one trillion days since a locally acquired infection. Looks like that this has lead to some pretty extensive lines this morning. Mandatory read for this morning is political editor Katharine Murphy’s analysis on the federal cabinet reshape: “Morrison’s cabinet reshuffle makes women responsible for helping men who should know better, be better.” Incredible, really, (and yet crushingly predictable, somehow) that Andrew Laming would have the audacity to make an appeal for privacy while finding the time to front his local radio station and dish some alternative “facts” about unsavoury incidents that have forced him to signal time on his parliamentary career. Also incredible (and yet not, somehow) that the Nationals MP Anne Webster would need to make a formal complaint to the party leadership after being sexually harassed by a male colleague in the House of Representatives chamber (a public place last time I looked) during a week where the government was lurching from disaster to disaster. You can read the full story below: NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian says she’s disgusted by a report that a Coalition colleague offered a woman money to have sex with him at NSW parliament, AAP reports. The NSW premier was asked about an ABC report that NSW National party MP Michael Johnsen offered a sex worker $1,000 to come to parliament for sex and sent the woman lewd text messages and an obscene video while he was sitting in the parliamentary chamber. The report comes a week after the Upper Hunter MP went on leave and moved to the crossbench after denying allegations he raped the same woman at the Blue Mountains in 2019. The woman told the ABC she exchanged hundreds of messages with Johnsen after responding to his online advertisement for sex in August, 2019. Berejiklian was asked about the latest report on Sydney radio 2GB on Tuesday. If that is correct I am absolutely disgusted ... For many women in public life when you know the challenges that exist – when colleagues or former colleagues do that type of thing – it is just beyond disgusting. Berejiklian said police were investigating the rape allegation “so I can’t really say more than that”. I want all workplaces and not just in politics, in all spheres of life, to be respectful to women and to treat them equally. She wanted people to acknowledge the subconscious bias that exists against women – “especially those in leadership positions”. My job and the job of others is to lead by example and to call out what is unacceptable behaviour. Not strictly Australian news, but it certainly affects us: maritime passage through the Suez Canal can finally resume after the giant Ever Given cargo ship has been fully refloated. Navigation in the canal resumed at 6pm local time (4pm GMT and ADET), the head of the Suez Canal Authority said, with livestock ships the first to be allowed through. At least 113 of over 420 vessels that had waited for Ever Given to be freed are expected to cross the canal by Tuesday morning, but analysts expect it could take at least another 10 days to clear the backlog on either end. If you want to know more, check out Guardian Australia’s TikTok channel where I’ve broken the whole situation down into bite-size chunks! The Queensland premier has been asked if the state government will step in to provide economic support to business during the lockdown given the federal jobkeeper system has now expired. Palaszcuck didn’t really give a straight answer on this point: I have been very strong that I absolutely believe that jobkeeper should have been extended, and especially targeted at some further relief measures for especially those businesses in the tourist industry that have been hard-hit by the closures of international borders. A lot of operators across Queensland, of course, are very much looking forward to the school holidays. And we are keeping our fingers crossed that this current breakout can be contained in the three days, which will allow people to go ahead and enjoy their Easter plans. But it’s unfortunate, but we’ve gotta keep the community safe. And I think the tourism industry would be very unforgiving if there was a mass outbreak in one of their tourist hot spots. That would be damaging not just locally, nationally, and in the future internationally. Palaszcuck has been questioned as to why Queensland health authorities could not handle an outbreak of seven cases without locking down the city: Well, we need to do this because this is a highly infectious strain. And we needed to do it quickly. We needed a sharp, hard lockdown. It worked effectively when we did it last time. It is a very big and a very tough call, but I have to take the advice of Health, and I took the advice of Dr Young... And her advice was to do this because we were seeing community transmission out there. And when you have free-flowing, unlimited restrictions in a lot of areas, that means a lot of people gathering, a lot of people meeting, and we needed to contain it quickly, so we needed to do this snap lockdown. Annastacia Palaszczuk says the number of active Covid-19 cases in returned travellers has dramatically increased: We currently have 73 active Covid patients in our hospitals at the moment. Sixty-three of those, I’m told around 63, are people who have acquired that from overseas, that have been in our hotel quarantine. So, a few months ago, we were down to, I think it was two or three positive Covid patients in our hospitals. We have seen a dramatic increase, particularly over the last month, because we are seeing large numbers of returned travellers that are testing positive and are testing positive to that UK strain. Annastacia Palaszczuk says the nurse who has Covid-19 worked one shift while unvaccinated: Well, what I can say is that 41,000 of our frontline health and our hotel quarantine staff have actually received their first vaccine. That’s around 89%. So, that’s a good sign and it’s just unfortunate in this issue that this particular nurse worked one shift in this ward where she was unvaccinated. My understanding is that over the next couple of weeks that will be 100% of people vaccinated, and around 7,000 people have been getting their second vaccinations. So the vaccination rollout is going ahead. But, of course, we want to make sure that that particular cohort gets their vaccine as soon as possible. The Queensland premier says she will give an official update on Covid numbers at 9am Queensland time – 10am in Melbourne and Sydney. She is speaking with ABC News Breakfast now. Scott Morrison’s standing with female voters has taken a hit as the political crisis triggered by the mishandling of Brittany Higgins’ rape allegation became the water cooler issue for the electorate, with the prime minister’s approval rating down 10 points in a fortnight and disapproval up by 10%. The latest Guardian Essential poll confirms Morrison’s approval rating slipped from 62% to 57% in the past fortnight as the the prime minister sought to contain the fallout of federal parliament’s #MeToo moment – with the slide driven by Australian women. While Morrison’s approval with women voters is now down 16 points since the Higgins story broke in February, the prime minister’s standing with male voters has remained unchanged through the fracas, with only a minor uptick in disapproval recorded within the poll’s margin of error, which is plus or minus three points. You can read the full report below: A huge reward is being offered for information about the cold case murders of a brother and sister in Melbourne’s south-east more than 30 years ago, AAP reports. Doris McCartney, 71, and Ronald Swann, 69, were found dead in their Keith Street home in Moorabbin on 22 October 1989. Both had been assaulted but investigators have been unable to discover why they were killed. Homicide squad Detective Inspector Tim Day said police believed that someone had come to the property to see Doris and there was an altercation: Doris was a widower and her younger brother had moved into her Keith Street home to support her ... From all accounts, they lived a quiet life and police have never been able to determine why they were both murdered. Police are now offering a reward of up to $1m for information about who was responsible for their deaths: There will be someone out there who knows why Doris and Ronald were killed and by who – 31 years is a long time to carry a secret. Labor is rolling out its plan to bring manufacturing jobs back to Australia today. Their plan centres around “a national reconstruction fund”, a $15bn kitty to drive pandemic recovery if Anthony Albanese becomes prime minister. Essentially the government bank would financially support projects across a range of areas such as mining, food and beverage processing, local train manufacturing, car and shipbuilding. Medicines, vaccines and medical devices, defence capabilities and other projects across software, engineering and robotics would also be eligible. The former secretary of Andrew Laming’s Bowman branch says she is surprised it has taken so long for complaints against the Queensland MP to be made public, given his history of making constituents “uncomfortable”. Suzi Foster was one of three branch executive members suspended from the Liberal National party in 2018 when a letter they wrote to members calling for Laming to be disendorsed was made public before electorate pre-selections. Foster told Guardian Australia concerns had been raised about Laming’s “erratic” behaviour from 2016: What has been alleged doesn’t surprise me. I’m just surprised it didn’t happen sooner. Foster quit the LNP after the suspension but had been a member since 2007 and was originally a supporter of Laming. She said she and other members had concerns about Laming’s “temper tantrums” and had pressed for change. You can read the full report below: Plenty of interesting thing from this interview but finally new home affairs minister Karen Andrews has been asked about the Biloela family– a Tamil family with two young children now being held in detention on Christmas Island while legal fights continue over the government’s attempts to deport them. Previous home affairs minister Peter Dutton has been steadfast that the family cannot stay, but some hope Andrews may take a different approach. She has declined to make any decisive comments this morning: So I understand all the issues from the community, I understand that there are a range of legal issues that still need to be addressed, and I will be briefed on that particular case, in more detail, probably tomorrow morning ... There are a significant number of issues, it would be very unwise and inappropriate of me to be commenting on that particular case or any case until I’m fully briefed on all the issues. You can read more about the Biloela family here: Karen Andrews has also been asked about Liberal backbencher Andrew Laming who has been accused of harassing multiple women both on and offline. While he says he will not contest the next election he could remain in parliament for up to a year with the government unwilling to remove him from the Liberal party – a move that would plunge the government into minority. At least one female Liberal MP has come out to condemn Laming, and although Karen Andrews sounded deeply unhappy with him, she stopped short of calling for him to move to the crossbench: Andrew Laming’s behaviour is just not acceptable. It’s just not, and it cannot be rationalised, it cannot be just covered up, and he does need to take responsibility for that. Now he has said that he will own mistakes and he will take action to address that through counselling. Good. I’ll be looking to see what the outcomes of that are, but I would expect significant changes in Andrew Laming’s behaviour because it hasn’t been acceptable ... Fran Kelly: He could sit on the crossbench. Andrews: Well, he could probably do a lot of things. I think the strongest signal that he’s given is that he’s not trying to contest the election. Part of Scott Morrison’s renewed focus on protecting women involved cracking down on social media abuse – which many feel is a slight cop-out given that the majority of the alleged sexual harassment issues in parliament have not been online. New home affairs minister Karen Andrews is being asked about this on ABC radio: The issues that social media presents is not going to be the only solution that we need to look at. It’s clearly exacerbating issues. Going back to the days where kids were able to come home from school or at least get a break, that doesn’t happen now … It has an impact on adults as well, so there are some things that we need to be looking at with social media, and its impact on our lives, not walking away from having to take strong action needed to deal with that. There’s a level of anonymity in social media that is concerning, that people are not making comments under their own name, and they can hide, and I don’t think they should be allowed to hide. Yesterday Scott Morrison announced a major reshuffle of the cabinet, with a special emphasis on women in the cabinet (although he actually added just one woman to the cabinet). Christian Porter and Linda Reynolds were the clear losers in the reshuffle – getting shunted to lesser portfolios – but one of the big winners was Gold Coast MP Karen Andrews, who is the new home affairs minister. Andrews is speaking to ABC radio now and says the new woman’s taskforce in the cabinet really will make a difference to women in Australia. She hasn’t provided many specifics on exactly how: Well, there are specific responsibilities in relation to women ... [There is] a very concerted effort to make sure that the voices of women are heard. And we are reflecting the views of women in the community ... I think what is really, really going to happen is a stronger role for women in developing policies to making sure that the policies that are being developed across government, and being mindful of the impact that they will have on women. Good morning, to everyone, but especially to the Brisbane readers waking up in lockdown today. Matilda Boseley here to make your morning a little less boring and bring you all the news from around the country (since some of you aren’t allowed out your front door). Obviously, Queensland is top of mind today. We are likely to have an update on the overnight Covid-19 numbers sometime this morning, which should give us a sense of how likely the lockdown is to continue – although we won’t get any official word until tomorrow. It’s likely the role the federal government’s slow vaccination rollout played in the outbreak will come to the fore – one of the more worrying community infections in the outbreak is from an unvaccinated nurse working at a Covid-19 ward in a Brisbane hospital. Yesterday premier Annastacia Palaszczuk took a subtle swipe at the federal government, saying local outbreaks and lockdowns were going to be part of the Australian way of life until everyone was vaccinated: It is very important that the vaccination rollout continues and that people continue to book in with their GPs, especially those GPs that are administering the vaccine. But until we have the population vaccinated there is of course the risk of community transmission. More than 541,000 Australians have received their first vaccines, including 259,000 in the past week, but given that the federal government aimed to have 4 million people immunised by April, people are less than impressed. This lockdown also came just as jobkeeper support payments ended, so I dare say that will come up a bit today as well. And it wouldn’t be a 2021 morning without some new news about behaviour towards women in the political world. (Yesterday I chose to listen to a violent true crime murder podcast rather than an update on the state of the gender relations in the government because it was less stressful.) Last night Queensland police confirmed they received information about Liberal backbencher Andrew Laming allegedly taking a photo of a woman whose underwear was showing as she bent over in the workplace. The woman and a witness to the incident on Monday told Nine News they had initiated a complaint with Queensland police. But police later said in a statement the woman had spoken to them on Monday afternoon and was “not proceeding with a formal complaint at this time”: Police are in the initial stages of assessing allegations against a man. Laming claims the photo attempted to show someone trying to fit an impossible amount of stock into a fridge. Although he says he will not contest the next election the government has refused to remove him from parliament, despite Liberal senator Sarah Henderson calling for it, a move that would plunge the government into a minority. The backbencher is now on leave and undergoing empathy training. That might be enough to get us started for today, let’s dive in.

Is the climate crisis the biggest issue the UK faces as a nation and will you commit to making it Labour’s priority for the duration of this parliament? Rebecca Long-Bailey The climate crisis is the greatest challenge we face as a nation and as a globe, not just for this parliament but in the decades and century to come. The inactions of previous governments have escalated the urgency of the challenge we face; and it is a challenge we can only meet by addressing the crisis in our living standards and the crisis of faith in our democracy. As leader I will continue the work I’ve been doing with trade unions, Labour activists and technical experts to develop a plan on how we do this, for example, developing our policies such as insulating 27m homes, using public ownership to transition to a green, affordable energy system, creating an industrial strategy to deliver high-quality, unionised jobs across the country and developing a detailed, properly funded plan to make sure no one loses out from this transition. As a Labour party we need to work with communities about what policies they want to see that would transform their lives and meet the climate crisis. We need to continue to harness the energy and enthusiasm of campaigners and young climate strikers who have helped push the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda through their actions, and work with them to show the world we are opposed to Trump’s climate crisis denial when our country hosts Cop26 this year. Lisa Nandy Yes. As prime minister I would make reaching climate safety the top priority for the whole of my government. I know it is not beyond us not only to build a zero-carbon economy but also to lead the global effort required to reach climate safety. I know that solving the climate crisis means integrating the solutions into every part of what the government does and that means hard-wiring the answers into the very foundations of our country’s economic and foreign policies. One of the first things I did on becoming Labour’s shadow energy secretary back in 2015 was to read Elizabeth Kolbert’s book, Field Notes From A Catastrophe. It brought home to me the scale of the risks from the climate emergency. Climate breakdown isn’t just a far-off threat to other people in other places in some distant future. You can already see the impact that even the warming to date is having in terms of the horrific fires raging across Australia and California, the shifting rain patterns damaging livelihoods for millions of people across Asia and Africa, and the unprecedented flooding we’ve seen here in Britain in recent years. We don’t have the luxury of time so yes it would be a top priority for me during this parliament too. Kier Starmer Yes – and for the next parliament when we are in government. We all have a common interest in rapid decarbonisation, so it needs to be a guiding thread across all policy areas: from foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing. 2. As Labour leader, how will you tackle the climate crisis between now and the next general election [ie what can be done while you are in opposition?]. Can you give three specific examples? RLB As leader I will continue my record of forcing the Tories to U-turn and back down on some of their most destructive policies, such as their support for fracking. It was Labour that meant parliament declared a climate and environmental emergency, work that I led. In parliament we need to keep piling the political pressure on the Tories, for example, using our presence there to bring an end to the ban on onshore wind in England and fighting any attempt to water down our environmental commitments in any trade deals we strike, particularly with the US. At the Cop26 later this year as Labour leader I will be stood shoulder to shoulder with campaigners and activists fighting for a landmark series of commitments and agreements. The eyes of the world will be on us when Trump, the climate breakdown denier, arrives and our prime minister gives him a warm welcome. Moves to curb the civil liberties of, or label peaceful activists as extremists, must be resisted. As Labour leader I also want to give prominence to what Labour can do in power. Many Labour local councils and mayors are declaring climate emergencies and developing their own Green New Deals with their local communities. The Labour councillors and community activists taking this lead are examples of how we can reach into local communities, organise and campaign – lessons we need to learn ahead of the next general election. LN As shadow energy and climate secretary, before the Paris summit, I initiated a collaboration between more than 60 Labour councils across Britain to cut the UK’s carbon footprint by 10% through action in the places where Labour is in power. Before the next election there is the opportunity to build on this with more on-the-ground activism to deliver on the Paris agreement through everything from solar energy coops to community tree-planting schemes and investment in bus services. By showcasing the solutions in our communities, and seizing on the opportunity for good new jobs in every town, Labour can help build out the climate movement into the more broad-based, society-wide force that we need it to be. Only through a movement will we stop a reckless Trump trade deal, which would threaten decades of hard-won rights and protections, and pave our way back to No 10 Downing Street. KS The climate crisis cannot wait until 2024. So, I will work with Labour administrations wherever they are in power – from councils, city mayors to devolved governments – as they involve communities, trade unions and businesses, to design their own pathways to zero net carbon by 2030. We need to encourage bottom-up solutions through supporting climate assemblies and green cooperatives. We must also be an effective opposition in parliament, holding the government to account on the basis of the pace of decarbonisation our planet needs – not the unambitious targets they have set themselves. 3. Will Labour under your leadership commit to: • Retrofitting all UK homes [27m] and buildings by 2030 and fight to ensure all new buildings are zero carbon by the end of this parliament? • Producing 90% of the UK’s electricity from renewable sources [through 7,000 offshore, 2,000 onshore turbines and 3x expansion of solar] by 2030? • Producing 50% renewable heating through 8m heat pumps and investment in hydrogen? RLB Yes, I commissioned the expert report, Thirty by 2030 (pdf), these recommendations are based on. It gives us a real plan to not only hold the government to account on what they are failing to do – but also helps turn what can be abstract targets to most people into real, everyday changes for the better. Insulating homes will end fuel poverty. An active industrial strategy will make sure that Britain is the producer of the wind turbines and other technologies we need for the future, creating good jobs and apprenticeships in our towns, cities and regions. The opportunities for large-scale renewal are endless – we just need to be ambitious and creative. It is a central part of how I believe Labour can sell our aspirational socialism to people across the country. LN I know we need a wholesale transformation in the way we power and heat our homes and businesses but that this is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities. As a windswept nation we can be the Saudi Arabia of clean energy, but all too often we are losing out on the jobs and factories to other countries with a different approach to industrial strategy and that has to change. KS I fully support Labour’s Green New Deal and the proposals for a Green Transformation Fund (pdf) and a National Investment Bank (pdf). The proposals offer a pathway to a greener economy married to social justice, which our country badly needs. It should be hardwired into everything we do as a country and as a party. 4. If yes, how should this work be financed and organised? RLB These are huge challenges and it requires bold and ambitious thinking. We already have deepening wealth inequality in this country and a crisis in living standards. The Conservative approach has been to load costs on to households that are already struggling, while letting energy companies profiteer. We can’t have this approach if we are going to turn this into an opportunity to deliver better lives and a better Britain. It’s why the proposal I set out at the 2019 election had public ownership and public investment in our energy system as a central plank, so we can be strategic and make sure that extra costs are not loaded on to homes that can’t afford it. For example, when it comes to insulating homes, it makes sense for the government to pay for the work upfront, and for the costs to be repaid by households who can afford it over time through savings on their energy bills. Lower-income households should not have to repay the cost of the works, so they can benefit from all the bill savings immediately. Delivering such a large programme in partnership with local communities, with local councils and public bodies playing a central role, can guarantee the quality of work to people’s homes and the quality of jobs we create. When it comes to developing the renewable energy sector and where the public is helping to provide the investment, the public should also get a long-term stake in what are profitable enterprises. The UK, as the world’s largest offshore wind market, should have a far greater role in manufacturing the technology, creating good, skilled jobs here, rather than relying on imports, as is currently the case. We should use our public stake to make sure these projects benefit communities, with local procurement boosting local supply chains. LN I would like to see a bigger role for people in every part of the country to influence and shape the transition so I’m fascinated to see what ideas will emerge from the first national citizens assembly on climate change. What’s clear is that the transition to date has not been funded fairly because low-income households have paid a disproportionately high contribution and the debate so far has been too technocratic and too driven from Brussels and Westminster. For the transition to work the solutions in the next phase must have broad support and benefit communities across the country and that’s more likely to happen if everyone can get involved. KS (see previous answer) 5. How will you ensure the poorest people in the UK and around the world are not made to pay disproportionately for the climate crisis? RLB For too long in this country, too many of our communities have been ignored and seen the erosion of their local public services. We cannot tackle the climate crisis by loading the costs on to the shoulders of those just making ends meet. As leader I will continue to pursue progressive mechanisms, such as public ownership and strategic public investment in the infrastructure we need for the future, in a way that delivers our broader goals of aspirational socialism. For example, expanding our bus networks and creating a public transport system that is integrated, accessible and affordable will improve our air quality and cut emissions, while improving regional connectivity, making life more convenient for millions. Internationally, we need to make sure the UK is a world leader not a world lagger – as the first in the world to industrialise and one of the wealthiest, we need to reduce our emissions at a rate that takes our fair share of the global responsibility to avoid more than 1.5 degrees of warming, as well as ensuring we are doing it in a way that is just and equitable at home. Social justice and aspiration go hand in hand with global justice. When Trump comes to this country for Cop26 Labour needs to join the voices from around the globe calling for urgent action. The poorest parts of the globe are already experiencing the worst impacts of climate breakdown, which they are least responsible for creating. That is why I support increasing the amount of international public climate finance the UK provides for mitigation and adaptation, and channelling these funds through the UN’s green climate fund, and away from the World Bank. Rather than welcome Trump to our country, we should be leading international efforts to establish a new fund to compensate countries in the global south for loss and damage suffered due to climate impacts. We can ensure the technologies developed in the UK and create jobs here through our green industrial revolution are also made available at reduced cost in the global south. LN It’s a tragedy and an injustice that it is the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world who are most exposed to the impacts of the climate crisis around the world. Their voice must be heard as we debate the solutions to the crisis, not just because it’s the right thing to do but also because it will help unlock the answers to a just transition. It was Europe’s approach of working together with the small island states of the South Pacific and the vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which built the global alliances that unlocked the Paris agreement. Britain’s leadership in international development helped to build these special relationships and shows why social justice and environmental justice go hand in hand. We should never see offsets as a cheap alternative to reducing pollution here at home and we must pay for the investments needed by ensuring the wealthiest who did most to cause the problem invest the most in fixing it, and by exploring the role that well-designed pollution taxes could play to ensure the fossil fuel industry helps clean up the mess it caused. KS The Green New Deal needs to be married to social justice both domestically and internationally. Domestically we need a just transition which provides good unionised green jobs, addresses regional inequalities and does not leave workers behind. The UK has profited from burning fossil fuels in the past, so we must assist developing countries in their leap forward, skipping our bad habits, building renewables rather than coal power stations. We should use our development budget – and work for greater international financial assistance – to help developing countries grow their own low-carbon economies. 6. Do you support more new nuclear power stations after Hinkley C is completed and, if so, how will they be funded? RLB I support new nuclear power where it is needed for the UK’s future energy security. We need to find the right funding model that will guarantee value for money for the taxpayer and ensure any public stake is used in a way that benefits local communities. Lisa Nandy I’m not writing my manifesto for the next general election just yet but I have argued consistently and for many years that now – right in the middle of a climate emergency – is not the time we should rule out a role for nuclear power or any other low-emission technology. The biggest challenges for the nuclear industry are the high costs associated with new nuclear stations, and their lack of a long-term sustainable solution to deal with the harmful waste they produce, but we will have to weigh these problems against the contribution nuclear power can make to meeting our energy demands in a way that creates good jobs and is consistent with building a zero-carbon economy and it is most important that we are guided by the science and the evidence on this. KS I support the Labour position that nuclear power is part of the mix of moving away from fossil fuels. But our overwhelming focus must be on increasing the energy share of renewables including solar, wind and tidal energy, and with decentralised energy. 7. Do you support HS2? RLB Yes. The government’s mismanagement of the cost and delivery date is a national scandal, and much more needs to be done to manage the local environmental impacts. However, HS2 is needed to increase the UK’s rail capacity, reducing reliance on our roads for passengers and freeing up capacity for more freight travel. This should be part of a more ambitious programme for public transport. For example, we should be building high-speed rail down from Scotland, projects like Crossrail for the north, connections between our towns and reopening branch closures. LN The government has completely mishandled the HS2 project. They have let costs spiral and failed to make the argument for the merits of the scheme. HS2 should never be allowed to justify any failure to invest in the bus networks and other clean public transport projects, which should be a higher priority than this single railway, but it should be possible to both improve the capacity of the existing rail and bus network and expand it too so yes, it should go ahead. KS If we are serious about the climate emergency, we must invest in green public transport. For that to work effectively there has to be a national plan for an integrated public transport network, and HS2 should have been a part of that. I voted against HS2 because of the social and environmental impact it will have on Euston in my constituency. But the project is now inevitably going ahead, and my focus is compensation and mitigation locally. I recognise the need for connectivity in the north and Midlands but the project should have started there, not from London. HS2 should not proceed at the expense of other really important rail upgrades like Crossrail for the north. 8. Do you support or oppose the third runway at Heathrow and/or all airport expansion? RLB Labour was clear in our manifesto that any expansion of airports must pass our tests on air quality, noise pollution, climate change obligations and countrywide benefits, including the current proposals for Heathrow expansion. We need to be rigorous in upholding these tests; as leading scientists have again pointed out the proposals do not meet Labour’s tests, particularly on climate change and as such I do not support them. LN I voted against a third runway at Heathrow because of the extraordinary environmental damage it would clearly cause, not just to our climate but to Londoners’ air quality too. I was a councillor in west London and the experiences I witnessed of people suffering from asthma was already shocking many years ago, and it absolutely can’t be allowed to get so much worse because of a failure of imagination in fixing our transport system. On airport expansion elsewhere in the country, we must be guided by the expert advice of the Committee on Climate Change in terms of what level of aviation growth could be consistent with our climate change laws and international commitments. KS I voted against Heathrow expansion because of the impact on climate change. We need to be serious about the climate emergency and our commitments under the Paris agreement. I personally don’t think that’s consistent with approving airport expansion but, of course, I’ll look at any proposals and measure them against climate tests. 9. Do you back financial support specifically for rewilding projects and commit to Labour’s existing policy to create 10 new national nature parks; rewild the 10 existing national parks and create “natural corridors” in the form of local parks, walking pathways, cycling lanes and canals? RLB Yes. These are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about. LN Tackling the climate emergency needs to go hand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment. Our country is one of the least wooded in the whole of Europe, and yet we know that trees lock up carbon, provide vital habitat for wildlife, and improve air quality in towns and cities. I also believe that every child deserves to have access to trees and green spaces as they grow up, wherever they live and whatever their parents’ income. So I would absolutely create 10 new national nature parks and back natural corridors. I would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them. Rewilding is something I think we need to explore with local communities in the places where schemes like this might go forward. I am convinced we can find the right mixture of natural regeneration, new tree-planting and support for sustainable farming in this country, but to do so we first need to see off the risks of a Trump trade deal that would sacrifice environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards and throw many UK farmers on the scrapheap. KS Rewilding is an essential part of the fightback against the climate and environmental emergency. I support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets. Our children are breathing toxic air in 71% of UK towns and cities - this is a national scandal and more green spaces must be part of the solution. 10. Do you support a post-Brexit agricultural subsidy regime to support environmental schemes such as tree planting, soil and peat restoration and flood protection? Should that funding be at least £1bn a year, ie a third of the current EU CAP scheme? RLB I support maintaining the current level of funding support to British farming and farmland management. However, I will pursue a “public money for public goods” approach, and would want to see agricultural subsidies conditioned on sustainable land use practices like tree planting, soil and peat restoration, flood protection and biodiversity promotion. Under my leadership, Labour would invest in forestation and landscape restoration, for example, our commitment to invest £3.7bn over a decade in tree planting, but this funding would be additional to payments in the agricultural subsidy regime. LN It’s bonkers that millionaires on the rich list are still raking in vast subsidies of taxpayers’ cash from farm subsidies. Investing public money should always be about securing public goods, not offering backdoor handouts to wealthy Tory donors. Our farmers will need to play a crucial role in restoring nature, storing carbon to cut emissions, and growing healthy and sustainable food, and these are public goods our subsidy regime should be helping us to meet. With Boris Johnson pursuing such a hard Brexit, there is a real risk that these goals could be undermined in the pursuit of a low-standards, reckless trade deal with Trump and we must fight that every step of the way. KS Trees, soil, and peat are natural carbon sinks so restoring and replanting them will be key to our aims of net zero carbon emissions. As the recent floods across much of England and Wales demonstrate, the UK’s flood protections are already insufficient, and the worsening climate crisis promises even more violent weather and rising sea levels. Significant investment in flood defences is therefore a priority to mitigate the worse effects of climate change. 11. Do you support the implementation of policies to reduce red meat consumption in the UK? If so what form might that take? RLB Growing numbers of people are cutting down on red meat, or becoming vegetarian and vegan, as people think about the environment and their health. It’s been really positive how we’ve seen businesses respond to that growing demand in producing substitutes for old favourites like the sausage roll. Too often the green movement has been painted as telling people what they can and can’t do. We need to find a different way of having discussions as a country on these issues while not losing focus on the most urgent questions facing us. Fighting climate change is about key players across the world coming together to collectively address the challenge we face, and working out in this country how we can restructure our economy so that it is both sustainable and able to support a high quality of life for everyone. LN The priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food. In my view this is not about telling people what to eat – it’s about tackling food waste, working with farmers to reduce pollution from things like artificial fertilisers and pesticides, and protecting high-quality food production in the UK from the impacts of reckless trade deals. I also think we have to have a much stronger focus on food poverty. Children going to school hungry in one of the richest countries in the world is both heart-breaking and shameful. KS After fossil fuels, the food industry – particularly the meat and dairy sector – is one of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, to deforestation. All of us should therefore think about how we might reduce our consumption of red meat. But changes in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change. That’s why I support Labour’s plans for a radical Green New Deal to combat the climate and environmental emergency. 12. Do you support a frequent flyer tax to reduce air travel? RLB At the moment the vast majority of the population fly once a year or less – they shouldn’t be unfairly taxed. We don’t want to penalise or make it harder for people to go on holiday. But it is right to consider how we ask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights. In government as Labour leader I would ensure we review aviation taxation and consider and consult on the development and implementation of proposals recommended by the Committee on Climate Change. LN It cannot be right that when 70% of flights are taken by just 15% of the public, the wealthiest people who are polluting the most do not pay a level of tax to reflect this and instead pay the same as the family taking their hard-earned rest once a year, so yes as prime minister I would look to make the system fairer and greener. KS Air travel is a particularly fossil fuel-intensive form of travel so, especially while we do not have the technology for green flights, we should encourage people to use alternative forms of transport where possible. We need to make sure that our tax system encourages that. 13. Will you commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building? RLB Yes. We need greater funding for and an expansion of public transport, cycling and walking for all sorts of reasons – not just in tackling the climate crisis, but to improve our economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air. LN It is absolutely scandalous that when 60% of journeys are by bus, literally thousands of local bus routes have been cut since the Tories came back to power, hundreds just in the last year, and fares have been allowed to rocket too. I would invest properly in public transport – and yes nationalise the railways, but also give councils the power to run bus routes for people not profit so they can set the fares and the routes and ensure all the buses in the fleet are zero carbon by 2025. I know that where Labour is in power, our mayors and councils are paving the way on cycling and as a result the number of cyclists is going up, so I would work with them to ensure communities get the investment they need to build on these successes. KS The government has made a political choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport. I would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system – with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians. 14. Do you back clean air zones that charge or ban polluting vehicles in urban areas, which government research shows are the most effective policy to reduce air pollution? RLB Yes, I support a new Clean Air Act enshrining the World Health Organization’s advisory air quality standards into domestic law. This would include clean air zones around schools. I was proud to announce Labour’s electric car revolution at Labour conference last year, setting out how an industrial strategy can support the sector to transition to manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries, and proposing creative measures such as electric community car clubs. So alongside an expansion in public transport we are also ensuring that we are transitioning over to zero emission vehicles, and that transition supports jobs and industries here in Britain. LN It is truly shocking that one in 19 deaths in our largest cities and towns are linked to air pollution when we can and should do much more to prevent this. In London, Oxford, Reading and most of the south-east, levels are above the limits recognised as safe by the World Health Organization and on some days many kids can’t even play outside in their school playgrounds without a high risk of suffering an asthma attack caused by the toxic state of the air. Labour in local government is leading the way on tackling this through schemes like [London mayor Sadiq Khan’s] Ulez [ultra-low emission zone] and [Bristol mayor Marvin Rees’s] diesel ban in Bristol. We need the new clean air legislation expected this year to ensure our air is healthy to breathe, in line with WHO advice, and to bolster the strong local government action Labour is leading. KS Air pollution already contributes to over 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, and is particularly damaging to the health of our children, who are breathing unsafe levels of air pollution in 71% of our towns and cities. That’s why I’ve called for an immediate Clean Air Act to tackle air pollution by creating clean air zones. 15. The Committee on Climate Change says the UK is unprepared for the impacts of climate change. Will you increase funding for adaptation and what policies do you support to prepare for the inevitable increases in flooding, heatwaves and summer water shortages? RLB Yes. I stand by Labour’s 2019 commitment to invest an additional £5.6bn to level up flood defences over 10 years, paid for through public capital investment. The new fund will prioritise areas of need, particularly in regions such as the north-west, Yorkshire and the east Midlands that have been neglected under the Tories. Climate change will place huge pressures on our freshwater resources. But the UK’s privatised water companies have done a terrible job managing that resource, with only 14% of rivers safe for swimming, record fines issued for sewage leaks, and 20-25% of our water wasted before it even reaches our taps. That is why managing our water security in a warming climate will require publicly owned, democratically accountable water companies. Better insulated homes, delivered through Labour’s mass retrofitting programme, will be better adapted to extreme summer heat as well as keeping us warm in winter. LN Short-term Tory cuts to flood budgets left scars on communities across the country and are one of the worst impacts of their damaging austerity programme. We’re lucky to have some of the foremost experts in the entire world in the Met Office, the Committee on Climate Change, and in many of our universities, to advise us on what we should do to prepare for climate change and so we should heed their advice about what dangerous impacts we must prepare for to ensure we are limiting the damage from worsening extreme weather wherever we can and that means properly investing in flood defences. KS As demonstrated by the recent flooding of much of England and Wales and the fact that the last five years have been the hottest five years on record, the effects of climate breakdown have already begun. Mitigating those effects will be essential and funding needs to match our new needs – but it should not distract from our absolute commitment to prevention through urgent emission reductions and a Green New Deal. 16. What direct diplomacy should Labour undertake with international partners to help make Cop26 a success? RLB The eyes of the world will be on us at Cop26; we need to show them we reject those who deny the climate crisis or continue to fail to act on its urgency. World leaders have to heed the warnings of young climate activists whose future is at stake; the world is increasingly in flames as we have seen in the Amazon, California, Australia and in Scotland last spring. As Labour leader I will work directly with our sister parties in Europe and across the world, both in power and in opposition, to help make sure an ambitious set of demands and commitments are agreed at Cop26. LN I was proud to lead Labour’s international delegation to the historic Paris summit and to meet the civil society leaders and diplomats who worked so tirelessly to secure that deal. So I know how precious and hard-won it was and is and why it is essential we now defend it and see it implemented in full. Across the world it is gutsy, young women like the prime ministers of Finland and New Zealand, who are carrying the hopes and dreams of Greta and the youth movement into the global diplomatic arena and making strides forward and if I am prime minister I promise to join them. Ahead of the Cop26 summit in Scotland later this year, there is an opportunity for Labour to build on the initiative I kick-started five years ago to showcase climate solutions where we are in power in local government, city halls and the Welsh assembly and to share the learning from these experiences internationally, as I know Sadiq has been doing with London’s experiences through the C40 network of cities who helped secure the Paris agreement. KS We know that climate change is an unavoidably international problem. So we must match our efforts for a Green New Deal at home with our efforts abroad. The UK should use our Cop26 presidency to build and lead an international net-zero coalition. On 8 March 2020, I’m meeting with activists and experts in Birmingham to begin co-designing the demands that we think the Labour party should make of our government and of governments around the world at Cop26. We will be there in Glasgow alongside our European sister parties to hold governments to account for future generations. 17. Would you support a progressive alliance with the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Greens and Plaid Cymru around climate action and backing for a green new deal? RLB Labour’s green industrial revolution is one of the most ambitious policy platforms in the world for how a country can decarbonise and be sustainable. It can be a rallying call for the concrete demands we need to implement to meet our climate targets, and put the achievement of social justice and the creation of good, unionised jobs at its heart. I will work with anyone who supports those demands in parliament, across our trade unions, the labour movement, civil society and activists. As Labour leader I will make sure that Labour is part of the coalition keeping this issue high on the political agenda and will resist any moves to restrict the civil liberties of peaceful activists and campaigners ahead of Cop26. At Cop26 I think Labour should push for the UK to adopt more ambitious national targets on climate change, to provide increased levels of public climate finance, and to lead international efforts to establish a new fund for loss and damage. LN I have seen the leadership [Green party MP] Caroline Lucas has brought to the climate debate, and I know that like me she has championed a Green New Deal so yes of course I would work with her and MPs from all parties to make it a reality. KS We need a Labour government to implement a Green New Deal, hardwired into all our policies to mitigate the damage of climate and environmental breakdown, while empowering communities and creating good, green jobs across the country. Every community deserves the right to vote for a Labour government. But we will work with other parties in parliament where they share our aims."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/26/solar-power-breaks-uk-records-thanks-sunny-weather","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T15:09:00Z","webTitle":"Solar power breaks UK records thanks to sunny weather","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/26/solar-power-breaks-uk-records-thanks-sunny-weather","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/26/solar-power-breaks-uk-records-thanks-sunny-weather","fields":{"headline":"Solar power breaks UK records thanks to sunny weather","bodyText":"Solar power has broken new records in the UK by providing nearly a quarter of the country’s electricity needs, thanks to sunny skies and relatively low summer demand. National Grid said the thousands of photovoltaic panels on rooftops and in fields across the UK were generating 8.7GW, or 24.3% of demand at 1pm on Friday, smashing the previous high of 8.48GW earlier this month. Experts said the unprecedented share for solar energy meant about 60% of the UK’s power was low carbon, taking into account Britain’s wind farms and nuclear power stations too. That figure is normally around 50%. National Grid, which is tasked with ensuring a match between supply and demand for electricity, said it was excited but unfazed by the challenge of accommodating “significant volumes” of renewables. Duncan Burt, who manages day-to-day operation of the grid, said: “We have planned for these changes to the energy landscape and have the tools available to ensure we can balance supply and demand.” Hannah Martin, head of energy at Greenpeace, said: “Today’s new record is a reminder of what the UK could achieve if our government reversed its cuts to support for solar, and backed the clean technologies that could provide jobs, business opportunities and plentiful clean energy for decades to come.” The milestone reached on Friday is the latest in a series of records for solar, which has grown from almost nothing seven years ago to 12GW of capacity today. Last summer it provided more power than the UK’s last 10 coal-fired power stations. In April this year, Britain achieved its first-ever full working day without coal power since it started burning the fuel in 1882, thanks in part to solar energy. Solar’s rapid growth is overturning conventions for the managers of the UK’s power grid. In March, for the first time ever, the amount of electricity demanded by homes and businesses in the afternoon was lower than it was in the night, thanks to the cut in demand due to solar panels. Alastair Buckley, a solar expert at the University of Sheffield, said of the latest record: “I think it’s a positive sign. It’s free electricity today, for the consumer, and we should make the most of it.” He said that with solar continuing to be installed despite the government’s drastic subsidy cuts in 2016, further records will certainly be broken this summer and for years to come. Buckley said the grid could handle a far greater proportion of solar power than currently seen, because gas power stations could be ramped down. For National Grid, periods of high pressure bringing lovely weather to the UK like this week were: “really predictable, so easy to plan for,” Buckley said. Robert Gross of Imperial College said: “This doesn’t pose fundamental problem for the grid – many sunnier countries manage a similar proportion of solar on a much more regular basis.” Government statistics published on Thursday show that UK solar power capacity has grown from 11.3GW in April last year to 12.1GW this year, enough to power 3.8m homes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/mar/08/solar-energy-pioneer-monica-oliphant-on-charting-her-own-path-in-science","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-07T22:35:18Z","webTitle":"Solar energy pioneer Monica Oliphant on charting her own path in science","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/08/solar-energy-pioneer-monica-oliphant-on-charting-her-own-path-in-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/08/solar-energy-pioneer-monica-oliphant-on-charting-her-own-path-in-science","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy pioneer Monica Oliphant on charting her own path in science","bodyText":"It was 1973 and Monica Oliphant, a recently widowed mother of two, was washing the dishes one night when she first heard about the potential for solar energy. “[It was] at the time of the Arab oil crisis, and I heard on the radio someone saying, if we had solar energy, we wouldn’t have to fight over oil. That was the 70s and I managed to get work in this area. That was tremendously exciting.” While the word “pioneer” gets bandied around a lot, it seems apt when talking to 75-year-old Oliphant. Recently named South Australia’s senior Australian of the year, her long and brilliant career was recognised last year when she was appointed an officer of the Order of Australia for her work in the renewable energy sector as a research scientist, particularly in solar photovoltaics and power generation. It is even more inspiring considering she studied in the male-dominated area of physics in the early 60s, and went on to carved her own path in the energy sector, all while raising a family single-handedly. As a child, Oliphant had a keen interest in astronomy. She remembers joining a group called the moon watch group, which tracked the Sputnik and explorer satellites, and she had a holiday job at Mount Stromlo Observatory near Canberra. But she realised the sector wasn’t for her; it was “too abstract”. She did enjoy science and maths, and went on to study physics. She was the only female physics graduate at the University of Adelaide. “There weren’t many in the physics areas when I did honours in physics at Adelaide [University]. I was the only female in my group in 1960 but I never felt I was any different to anyone else in class,” she says. At university she met her husband and fellow physicist Michael Oliphant, son of pre-eminent scientist and former South Australian governor Sir Mark Oliphant. She began working in the male-dominated electricity supply sector at the Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA), after completing her studies. “People would ask me where I worked and I’d say, and they’d ask, ‘Are you a receptionist?’” Oliphant stopped working for a time to raise children, but then Michael died of cancer in 1971. He was 35. “My husband died a couple of weeks before my second daughter was born. There was a big mortgage so I had to go back to work. I had to survive financially”, she says. “I wanted to be independent, and I had a five-year-old and newborn to support, so I moved back to Adelaide and got part-time work as a research assistant.” She worked in atomic research at the University of Adelaide and later Flinders University. By 1973, she had become fascinated with solar photovoltaics and renewable energy, and she spent 18 years focusing on renewables at ETSA. There was very little formal childcare in the early 70s, even for women who were single parents. “I only worked part-time initially. There wasn’t much childcare available, so I mainly improvised, but being at a university was helpful.” These days she looks at her adult daughters, both working mothers, and sees that there are still challenges for working women. “My two daughters have husbands, they have been able to have access to childcare but they work enormously hard and they are stressed out in their daily living. It’s not easy. I don’t think it’s easy for females to manipulate both a job and home life.” Oliphant’s career flourished, she says, mainly because she was left alone to pursue her own interests. “I reckon I was the employee from hell but I wanted to do these things and if it wasn’t in the work plan, I would say, ‘maybe I can get funding.’ I would do what I wanted, and they let me. Then I would get funding, so they couldn’t stop me. They thought it was easier to let me go and I probably wouldn’t do much harm.” She had no formal mentors. “The people I worked with were always helpful, but I didn’t have anyone in particular to work with, except for the people in the Australian Solar Energy Society.” Oliphant was also president of the International Solar Energy Society from 2008 to 2009 and it remains one of her career highlights. Much of Oliphant’s work would turn out to be ahead of its time including work in the early 1990s with public housing and examining the impact of energy efficiency of low-income families. “Back then the residential sector was regarded as too diverse and small to be looked at. Monitoring household energy use became mainstreamed shortly afterwards. So there was a lot of interesting work done then. It was enjoyable.” Currently an adjunct associate professor with the division of information technology, engineering and the environment at the University of South Australia, Oliphant remains active in the renewable energy sector. She is working on several projects. “One is on community-owned solar – trying to increase penetration within the community. I have [also] just finished ... a feasibility study on the potential to have a UN university on renewable energy and training in China.” That feasibility study took her and a group of international scientists to Malaysia, Russia and China. The team are currently waiting to see if their work is accepted. She is also the patron of the Corena Fund, a not-for-profit citizen group that collectively funds new renewable energy installations. “I’m fairly busy and I’m having an enjoyable time. If you are involved in something that [you] really believe in and you love, it keeps you going.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T03:08:49Z","webTitle":"China on track to lead in renewables as US retreats, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says","fields":{"headline":"China on track to lead in renewables as US retreats, report says","bodyText":"China is moving towards becoming a global leader in renewable technology as the US pulls away, a new report has said. China is the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and still invests in coal but in recent years it has become the largest investor in domestic renewable energy. The country is now on track to lead international investment in the sector, according to the report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). “As the global transition toward renewables gains pace and as battery storage and electric vehicles technologies pick up momentum, China is setting itself up to dominate these sectors globally over the next several decades of this century,” said IEEFA. IEEFA identified a record high spend of more than US$44bn by China on international takeovers and projects worth more than $1bn – a 38% year-on-year growth. China’s One Belt One Road agenda, which drives infrastructure investment along ancient trade routes, is leading the country’s growth. $8bn of solar equipment has been exported from China since it began, and the country has overtaken the US and Germany to become the number one exporter of environmental goods and services. “China’s presence in wind power globally is also on the rise, led by international activities of companies such as Goldwind and by China Three Gorges’ diversification away from hydroelectricity,” the report said. The trajectory is in stark contrast to that of the US, which last year pulled out of the Paris climate accord and has renewed its support for the coal industry. The decision to abandon the Paris agreement “led to China’s quick reaffirmation of its emissions-reduction pledge”, the report said. “That allows it to further project itself globally as a responsible major power while addressing its domestic air pollution concerns and building world-leading capacity in new energy markets.” As part of its Paris commitments, China pledged to peak its emissions by 2030 while making best efforts to peak earlier. It would also increase the share of renewable or nuclear energy sources to 20%. Co-author of the report and director of IEEFA, Tim Buckley, said China was setting itself up as a global technology leader “whilst the US government looks the other way”. “Although China isn’t necessarily intending to fill the climate leadership void left by the US withdrawal from Paris, it will certainly be very comfortable providing technology leadership and financial capacity so as to dominate fast-growing sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles and batteries.” The report noted the August 2017 merger of China’s top coal mining company, Shenhua Group Corp, with one of the “big five” power utilities, China Guodian Corp. The newly named China Energy Investment Corp created the world’s largest power generator, and with the clean-energy assets of Guodian, Shenhua’s growth was no longer dependent on the pursuit of coal. “[This] strategic posture [of pursuing coal] has burdened China’s power companies and limited their appetite for innovative new clean energy technologies,” the IEEFA said. The report also found China was “outmanoeuvring other economies” in securing energy commodity supplies such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, allowing them to dominate manufacturing of batteries and electric vehicles. On Monday, the US federal energy regulatory commission rejected a plan by the Donald Trump-led US administration to provide subsidies for coal-fired and nuclear power plants. Last year the energy secretary, Rick Perry, proposed moves to slow the phasing out of the ageing plants and Trump vowed to repeal Obama-era environmental regulations in a bid to end a so-called “war on coal”. However, independent analysis found the subsidies plan would cost taxpayers $10.6bn a year, and the commission on Monday said there was no evidence that retiring coal-fired power plants threatened the reliability of the nation’s electricity grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/18/web-of-australian-adani-solar-companies-leads-to-offshore-tax-havens","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T01:01:40Z","webTitle":"Web of Australian Adani solar companies leads to offshore tax havens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/18/web-of-australian-adani-solar-companies-leads-to-offshore-tax-havens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/18/web-of-australian-adani-solar-companies-leads-to-offshore-tax-havens","fields":{"headline":"Web of Australian Adani solar companies leads to offshore tax havens","bodyText":"Adani has spread its use of offshore tax havens to its Australian solar projects, providing another avenue that could allow the wealthy Indian family behind the transnational to legally minimise tax paid on income from local operations. Six companies linked to Adani’s renewables business, which chairman Gautam Adani wants to make the biggest in Australia by 2022, were registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 3 August. The companies all have Australian-based Adani executives as directors. But they fall into two groups – three companies in each – which follow a markedly different path to their ultimate owners. One trail leads back to Adani Enterprises, the stockmarket-listed company in India which is vying to build Australia’s largest coalmine, and in which the Adani family are the major shareholders. The other bypasses the public company in India entirely, leading back to the Adani family via privately owned companies based in the Cayman and British Virgin islands, recognised tax havens. The companies were registered a month before the energy giant said it would proceed with “one of the world’s most advanced solar energy plants” at Rugby Run near Moranbah, the largest of three plants Adani proposes in central Queensland and South Australia. Gautam Adani trumpeted the group’s Australian solar ambitions when announcing a power purchasing agreement for Rugby Run with an unnamed but “significant power retailer”. “We are the largest generator of solar energy in India and we aim to replicate that in Australia,” he said. Adani bought Rugby Run – a former cattle property once earmarked as a rail thoroughfare for transporting coal from its contentious Carmichael mine – for $1 on 9 June last year from Queensland beef barons the Acton family, transfer documents show. The site gives its name to one of three companies that signal the start of the tax haven trail from the Australian solar business: Adani Rugby Run Operations Pty Ltd, Adani Renewable Operations Pty Ltd and Adani Renewable Operations Holdings Pty Ltd. All three companies have a parent company in Singapore, Global Renewable Energy Holding Pte Ltd, which was incorporated in January with Vinod Shantilal Adani as sole director. Singapore company filings show Global Renewable Energy Holding Pte Ltd is owned by Atulya Resources Ltd in the Cayman Islands. Atulya Resources is in turn owned by ARFT Holding Ltd in the British Virgin Islands. Documents held by the Singapore corporate regulator disclose that “the Adani Family” is an ultimate shareholder of ARFT Holding Ltd. Back in Australia, the other three companies registered in August were Adani Renewable Assets, Adani Renewable Asset Holdings and Adani Rugby Run. They are held by Adani Global Pte Ltd in Singapore, which is held by Adani Global Ltd in Mauritius, in turn owned by the public company Adani Enterprises Ltd in India. Adam Walters, the principal researcher for Energy Resource Insights, who uncovered the new tax haven links, said Adani’s use of tax havens and parallel company structures was entirely legal. But he said they could enable the Adani family to generate income from operating the solar farms, via agreements with the public Indian parent company that owned the assets. These profits could then be channelled to the Adani family via the Cayman and British Virgin islands, which would have favourable tax implications for them, Walters said. “Rather than benefit because of their shareholdings in listed companies in India where they have to pay lots of tax, they could benefit via the British Virgin Islands,” he said. “What could well be the case is the listed companies have got the money behind them, they can build the things, but then the profits can be generated in the family-owned businesses.” Walters said this was a pattern suggested elsewhere in Adani’s corporate structures around Australian mine and rail projects. It arose when Adani Mining had an opportunity to dispose of a future liability worth billions, in the form of a $2 a tonne royalty deed held by the original owner of the Carmichael mine site, Linc Energy. When a distressed Linc agreed to offload the deed for $150m in 2014, it was not Adani Mining that bought it. Instead, Adani Mining lent $150m to an Adani family-held trust, linked to the rail project, to snap it up. “This means that the family could potentially receive over a billion dollars in the Caribbean even if the mine is unprofitable in Australia,” Walters said. “Adani Mining, rather than spending $150m, now have an IOU on their balance sheet for $150m. In the short term, the company looks healthier than it actually is and in the longer term, if the mine does go ahead then the Adani family make the money.” The trust that could enrich the family through coal royalties is held via the same tax haven companies as the solar companies. The $150m was one of several multimillion-dollar loans in Australia by public Adani company subsidiaries to private Adani family-owned companies. “If [the solar business] is the same as elsewhere, we know the Adani family has not actually put a single dollar into Australia – they’re inter-company loans to the family from the listed company,” Walters said. He said there were another three trusts registered by Adani in Australia around the solar projects but “beneficial ownership of these remains unclear at this stage”. The chief executive of Adani Mining, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, has dismissed any suggestion the Australian operations would be “hiding profits” via holding companies in tax havens. “There is absolutely no implication of this, as everything that is being done in Australia or in India is transparent,” he told India’s Economic Times. “We make regular filings to the tax offices and government authorities. This report is a desperate attempt by the activists who were not able to legally stall the [Carmichael] project or get the government to do it. “This is their last attempt to hurt the goodwill we enjoy, but we are going ahead with the project as planned.” The 175-megawatt plant would rate among Australia’s biggest solar projects, along with Adani’s proposed 100MW farm at Crinium Creek, also in central Queensland, and a 140MW far near Whyalla in South Australia. Adani is the largest solar generator in India. Adani declined to comment on the company arrangements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/ng-interactive/2015/nov/26/please-think-again-readers-respond-to-solar-energy-cuts-interactive","type":"interactive","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-26T08:00:11Z","webTitle":"'Please think again': readers respond to solar energy cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/nov/26/please-think-again-readers-respond-to-solar-energy-cuts-interactive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/nov/26/please-think-again-readers-respond-to-solar-energy-cuts-interactive","fields":{"headline":"'Please think again': readers respond to solar energy cuts","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/dec/05/american-wilderness-trump-energy-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-05T11:14:16Z","webTitle":"Lost lands?

The American wilderness at risk in the Trump era","bodyText":"In the great expanses of the Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument, the silence hits you first. Minutes pass, smooth and unbroken as glass. The smallest sound – a breath of wind, a falling rock – can seem as loud as passing traffic. Colter Hoyt knows this landscape well. As an outdoor guide, he walks the monument almost daily. Yet these days he is full of fear. This remote paradise of red rocks, slot canyons and towering plateaus faces an uncertain future, following a controversial presidential proclamation that removed 800,000 acres from the monument and opened land up for potential energy development. When Trump took office in 2016, he promised the energy industry a new era of “American energy dominance”. This would only be possible by exploiting America’s 640m acres of public land: mountains, deserts, forests and sites of Native American history that cover more than a quarter of the country. The US government has the discretion to decide what use a parcel of public land should be put towards, such as conservation, energy development or grazing. Under Trump, environmental advocates fear a shift to the extreme: land offered indiscriminately for mining and drilling, with disregard for other potential uses. Two years after Trump came to power, a new study produced by the Wilderness Society, a not-for-profit organization advocating for the protection of public lands, and shared exclusively with the Guardian, reveals the full extent of his government’s efforts. Key findings include: 13.6m acres onshore have been made available for leasing by the Trump administration, far more than in any two-year period under the Obama administration. More than 153m acres of ecologically sensitive habitats – from the California desert to the Arctic national wildlife refuge – have seen conservation protections rolled back in some form. More than 280m acres have been made available for offshore leasing in the Gulf of Mexico and along nearly 90% of the US coastline. For Hoyt, the prospect of mining on formerly protected lands is a scenario almost too painful to contemplate. On a recent August afternoon, as temperatures climbed to 95F, he bumped and shuddered down a winding road at the wheel of his expedition vehicle. His destination: a lookout point, from which the Circle Cliffs, an almost incomprehensibly vast segment removed from the monument, could be viewed. Motoring through the auburn hills, he became visibly emotional. “This is where the mining trucks would be driving in and out.” The Guardian profiled three affected communities in the American west – in the Utah desert, the southern Rockies, and valleys of western Colorado – to see three different responses to this shift toward energy development. The lost monument: the future of Grand Staircase-Escalante Many longtime cattle ranchers in the area had been upset by Clinton’s move, fearing their cattle would be kicked off grazing lands. “It felt like a pretty big disrespect to us,” explains Link Chynoweth, 57, a fourth-generation rancher and alfalfa farmer. He and other ranchers welcomed Trump’s rollbacks. The monument is an archeological, paleontological and environmental wonder, and its special new status brought change: tourists, new businesses and outdoor enthusiasts searching for a slice of frontier magic. While that has benefited some, it has left many others feeling ostracized. “I’ve been here all my life,” says Chynoweth. “So when environmentalists say we have to make this a monument because they have to protect it, I’m saying: ‘Who do you have to protect it from? Me?’ The message I’m getting is: if we don’t protect it, you guys will ruin it.” While cattle grazing on the monument remains a point of contention, it’s the energy industry that has environmentalists most concerned. A section removed from the monument known as the Kaiparowits Plateau sits on top of an enormous coal reserve – albeit one that may be too remote to develop. Meanwhile, a Canadian mining firm has boasted of its acquisition of the Colt Mesa, a former copper mine on land once circumscribed by the monument. In a recent draft management proposal for the monument and the now-excluded land around it, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) expressed a preference for a plan that would be the “least restrictive to energy and mineral development”. At auction land can be leased for as little as $2 an acre, but that doesn’t mean it always gets bought. Leases can also be purchased by companies simply to increase their asset portfolio, with no plans to develop it. The result is land being offered without a guarantee it will translate into more energy or other returns on investment for the American taxpayer. For Nicole Croft, the executive director of Grand Staircase Escalante Partners, the benefits of the monument are now at risk. “The monument has brought diversity,” she says. “It’s brought opportunities. It put this place on the map.” Ricki Brown, who came here more than 20 years ago, was one of the first to put the new tourist economy to the test. He built guest houses that now rent out to visitors from around the world, who enjoy sweeping views of flat-topped mesas and desert shrubs. “Basically everybody has jumped on the tourist wagon,” he says, “whereas we used to be the only ones doing it.” Blake Spalding, a Buddhist chef, opened her restaurant, Hell’s Backbone Grill, in 2000 – and has watched business flourish. “We now do in a month what we used to do in a whole year,” she says on a warm evening over a green salad and a glass of red wine. As hikers and adventure seekers file in to fill their stomachs, she insists “tourism has brought opportunities galore” beyond the food business. “You can start a guiding business. We need electricians, carpenters and janitors, too. The notion that we need an extractive industry is a lie.” To mine or not to mine: Colorado’s North Fork Valley faces a choice The closure of two key mine sites in 2013 and 2016, Elk Creek and Bowie #2, saw hundreds of coalminers laid off. Vineyards and cherry orchards now span the green valley floor, blossoming under the shadow of nearby mountains and sitting side by side with the former mines. When the BLM put 8,000 acres on the table for leasing in its December auction, it pushed people to decide what future they really wanted: bring back the energy industry, or embrace the new agricultural economy. While the majority of the lease sales were for methane gas reclamation from sealed coalmine sites, land near the Paonia Reservoir, which supplies the region’s irrigation water, would still be open to horizontal drilling for oil and gas. For the valley’s farmers, water contamination would be devastating. Alison Gannett is one of those farmers. At Holy Terror Farm, the 53-year-old grows all her own food – except for coffee, cocoa and salt – on her land and in sun-dappled greenhouses. A former professional free skier, Gannett moved to the town of Paonia 10 years ago after growing concerned about toxic drinking water near her previous home. Five years later, she developed brain cancer. “My favorite thing about the valley is to be able to grow my own food without being surrounded by toxins,” she says. Julie Bennett, too, depends on the water. She owns Skyhawk Vineyards: 35 acres of dark red pinot noir grape. When leases still loomed in late summer, Bennett was in the middle of making cherry wine she planned to sell at her new tasting room and cafe. “Water is the key to our success,” she says. “If an accident were to happen that diminished water quality, we would be out of business.” Tom Huerkamp has lived in the county for 51 years, with a front row seat to its economic transformation. “Do you know how many coalmines have closed in Delta county?” he asks. “Twenty-seven.” Huerkamp isn’t against change – he’s invested in solar energy himself. But as the board vice-president of Delta County Economic Development, he worries organic farming alone won’t be enough to make up for lost jobs. “As a community, instead of just digging our damn heels in, we need to talk to each other, objectively, without all of this emotional crap that goes in,” he says. But for Gerren Anderson, a former North Fork coalminer, fossil fuels aren’t the answer. Anderson was laid off in 2015 when the Bowie #2 mine closed and today lives on disability benefit. The decades underground left him with black lung, chronic bronchitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. “I don’t have any regrets,” he says. “I had a good career. I raised my family. I knew the risks. I just ran the machine longer than anybody else should.” Though many of his co-workers went into oil and gas after the mine closures, Anderson says he doesn’t support drilling in his own backyard. “I’m a hunter and a fisher, so I like to see our landscape the way it is.” Faced with the chance to welcome back the industry that once sustained it, the North Fork seems to be imagining a different future. A proposed 20,000-acre sale was successfully defeated in 2012, prompting local residents to develop their own, citizen-driven management plan for how they would like to see the valley used. In November, the North Fork tasted victory when the 8,000 acres were taken off the table: the BLM said it would defer all the leases in the valley until the completion of its Uncompahgre Resource Management Plan, which will guide management of the region’s public lands for the next 20 years. “People no longer see the future of this valley as tied to extractive industries,” says the environmental activist Pete Kolbenschlag , who campaigned against the proposed leases. “And we’re smart and sophisticated enough that we know what economic future we want for ourselves.” ‘The area is sacred’: Native American resistance in the Great Sand Dunes But a proposal to lease the mineral rights beneath their land – rights owned by the federal government – prompted a national outcry. Leases would have fallen within a mile of the park and Mt Blanca (Sisnaajiní in the Navajo language), a mountain so sacred it appears on the Navajo Nation flag. “The mountains are very symbolic,” explains Daniel Tso, a member of the Navajo Nation and a grassroots activist. “They are the real leaders who hold this land. Since time immemorial, they haven’t moved or been shaken.” Many saw echoes here of the energy industry’s longstanding encroachments on Native American lands – from the extraordinary Standing Rock reservation protests over the Dakota Access pipeline to the Havasupai tribe’s tireless resistance to uranium mining in the Grand Canyon. Kathleen Sgamma, the president of the energy lobbying group Western Energy Alliance, counters that “our modern lifestyle would not exist without oil and gas”. On a table in her glass-walled office in downtown Denver, golf caps, T-shirts and stickers bear the motto “Keep Calm and Frack On”. “We can all wish there was some other source of energy,” she says, “but the reality is that it’s keeping us safe, gives you clean water, heats your home, gets you where you need to go.” Across the mountain ridge from Great Sand Dunes, Bill Dixon runs a shop crammed with books, saddles, jackets and jewelry. Traveling indigenous groups often stop by while paying homage to the mountains, Dixon says. “The whole area is all sacred.” A member of the Menominee Indian tribe of Wisconsin, Dixon has lived here for the past 16 years. “This isn’t a town full of millionaires,” he says. “This is a town full of people who came here for quality of life. We came here for the clean air, the clean water, the lifestyle, the nature.” Like others in the valley, he worries that oil and gas development would affect the local water supply. “If they were to be fracking out there, they’d probably end up polluting the aquifer. I don’t see how they wouldn’t. We got the mountain in between us, so we might be safe, but I can’t be sure.” Ahead of the proposed recent lease sale, the local resistance mobilized. Organizers gathered and submitted public comments to the BLM. They staged a three-day campout at the proposed drilling site. They even organized a flight over the region to educate public officials about what was at stake. Christine Canaly, the director of the San Luis Valley Ecosystem Council, helped lead the effort. “We’re in the most remote part of the southern Rockies,” she said. “What are we going to do? Populate it with oil and gas drilling? That’s the antithesis of why this area has remained intact.” Their bid worked. The BLM has since agreed to delay lease proceedings to allow time to consult with the Navajo Nation. A date for consultation has not been set but, for now, the land is off limits. In the second week of December, the BLM will hold its final public lands auction of the year. More than 293,000 acres across Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming will be on the block. Meanwhile, environmental groups are preparing for two more years of resistance. “We accept some energy development will occur, but it has to be in the right places. There’s room for multiple uses,” said Nada Culver, the senior counsel at the Wilderness Society. “But this administration seems to only see room for one kind of use: developing fossil fuels at the expense of everything else, especially conservation.” All aerial photography by Bruce Gordon, courtesy of Bruce Gordon and EcoFlight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/21/whitefish-energy-company-halts-work-to-restore-puerto-ricos-power-over-unpaid-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T04:30:18Z","webTitle":"Whitefish energy company halts work to restore Puerto Rico's power over unpaid bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/21/whitefish-energy-company-halts-work-to-restore-puerto-ricos-power-over-unpaid-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/21/whitefish-energy-company-halts-work-to-restore-puerto-ricos-power-over-unpaid-bill","fields":{"headline":"Whitefish energy company halts work to restore Puerto Rico's power over unpaid bill","bodyText":"Whitefish Energy Holdings has said it is halting work on restoring power in Puerto Rico because it has not been paid by the US territory’s government. The company said late Monday that invoices for work done in October were outstanding and that it could no longer keep working. A letter sent to Puerto Rico officials stated the government owed Whitefish more than $83m. CEO Andy Techmanski told CNN, which first reported the news: “We stopped because of the financial situation and lack of payment with [the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or Prepa] has gotten beyond its maximum threshold of what we can sustain as a business. The exit plan is to try to get payment out of Prepa so we can continue to work for the last 10 days of our contract. “We took a huge leap of faith in coming here when others were very doubtful or scared to come because of the bankruptcy issues with the island and Prepa,” Techmanski said. “We came here to try to do something positive for the people of Puerto Rico.” Prepa said that pending payments had been halted after a Whitefish subcontractor contacted the authority requesting the stoppage because Whitefish owed them money. “Faced with this claim, Prepa had to stop the pending payments to Whitefish until the situation with the Whitefish subcontractor is clarified,” its statement read. The authority also said both sides were in talks to reach an agreement that would satisfy everyone involved. On Monday, Bill Clinton met with those left homeless by September’s category 4 storm and arrived with medical supplies and solar energy equipment donated by the Clinton Foundation, which has already shipped 76 tons of such aid. Governor Ricardo Rosselló said Clinton’s visit would help people realize that Puerto Rico still needed relief. “It’s important to have him here because he has a vision of how to emerge from the emergency phase, establish normalcy and begin to rebuild,” he said. The power dispute comes nearly a month after Rosselló’s administration canceled a $300m contract with Whitefish that is undergoing a local and federal audit. The contract had drawn scrutiny after the small Montana company – which at the time employed two people – won the contract to restore the island’s power system following Hurricane Maria. Federal committees have been trying to investigate how the contract was awarded to Whitefish, which is based in the home town of Donald Trump’s interior secretary, former congressman Ryan Zinke. The secretary has said that after the contract was awarded, he was in contact with Whitefish, and that his son had had an internship with the company. In October, Zinke criticised “dishonest media”, adding that “only in elitist Washington DC would being from a small town be considered a crime.” He denied any knowledge of or influence over the deal. The White House has also denied any impropriety. When asked by the CNN interviewer if he would do this again, Techmanksi paused and replied: “I would, I would do a lot of things different.” “I would probably get paid a lot more up front to cover the risks.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/jul/31/2017-is-so-far-the-second-hottest-year-on-record-thanks-to-global-warming","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-31T10:00:45Z","webTitle":"2017 is so far the second-hottest year on record thanks to global warming | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/jul/31/2017-is-so-far-the-second-hottest-year-on-record-thanks-to-global-warming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/jul/31/2017-is-so-far-the-second-hottest-year-on-record-thanks-to-global-warming","fields":{"headline":"2017 is so far the second-hottest year on record thanks to global warming","bodyText":"With the first six months of 2017 in the books, average global surface temperatures so far this year are 0.94°C above the 1950–1980 average, according to NASA. That makes 2017 the second-hottest first six calendar months on record, behind only 2016. That’s remarkable because 2017 hasn’t had the warming influence of an El Niño event. El Niños bring warm ocean water to the surface, temporarily causing average global surface temperatures to rise. 2016 – including the first six months of the year – was influenced by one of the strongest El Niño events on record. Reality has debunked the ‘warming stopped’ myth For a long time one of the favorite climate denier myths involved claiming that we hadn’t seen any global surface warming since 1998. That myth has fallen by the wayside since 2014, 2015, and 2016 each broke the global surface temperature records previously set in 2010 and 2005 (which were also both hotter than 1998). Yet the myth persisted for years because 1998 was anomalously hot due to the monster El Niño event that year, which meant that global temperatures weren’t much hotter than 1998 until 2014 to today. Now the first six months of 2017 have been 0.3°C hotter than 1998, despite the former having no El Niño warming influence and the latter being amplified by a monster El Niño. In 1998, there was also more solar energy reaching Earth than there has been in 2017. In terms of El Niño and solar temperature influences, 2017 thus far has been most similar to 2006, but 2017 has been 0.3°C hotter than 2006 as well. No, Rick Perry, the oceans aren’t to blame In a recent Senate committee hearing, Trump’s Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry said that he didn’t believe human carbon pollution is the primary control knob for the Earth’s climate (it is; hence the title of this NASA paper published in the journal Science in 2010), but instead placed most of the blame on “naturally occurring events – the warming and the cooling of our ocean waters.” That’s a simple hypothesis to test. If global surface temperatures were rising due to an exchange of heat from ocean cycles, then as Perry noted, ocean temperatures would be alternatively warming and cooling. When oceans transferred heat to the surface, their temperatures would cool, and vice-versa. That’s simply not happening – measurements show that the oceans have steadily built up heat: Instead, every component of the Earth’s climate is warming. Surface air temperatures, lower atmospheric temperatures, ocean temperatures, and sea levels are rising as ice around the globe melts. That’s a key signature not of an internal Earth cycle, but of an external influence – either an increase in incoming energy from the sun, or a decrease in outgoing energy, for example due to an increase in the heat-trapping greenhouse effect. And as we’ve established, there’s actually been a slight decrease in incoming solar energy. The culprit is quite clearly human carbon pollution. That’s how the first six months of 2017, despite lacking solar or El Niño ocean warming, can be hotter than 1998, and 2006, and every year before 2016. In fact, research has shown that global surface temperatures are already rising about 20 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate change, during the transition in and out of ice ages. And unless we take serious action to cut carbon pollution, that rate will rise to perhaps 50 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate change. Climate deniers have recently been shifting to the ‘global warming isn’t bad’ myth. It should go without saying that such rapid climate change is dangerous. Species can only adapt so fast. The IPCC concluded that we’re already approaching the point at which up to 30% of global species are at increasing risk of extinction. If we don’t take action to curb global warming, the IPCC projects that by century’s end, 40% or more of global species could go extinct, as we approach Earth’s sixth mass extinction. Today’s remarkably hot temperatures, caused by human carbon pollution, are a sign of what’s to come. If we don’t get global warming under control, the consequences will indeed be bad."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/creation-history-brilliant-ideas-build-on-the-past","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Creation history: brilliant ideas build on the past | David Eagleman and Anthony Brandt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/creation-history-brilliant-ideas-build-on-the-past","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/creation-history-brilliant-ideas-build-on-the-past","fields":{"headline":"Creation history: brilliant ideas build on the past","bodyText":"To understand one of the secrets of creativity, just peek into an art classroom in Denver, Colorado. The teacher asks her pupils to imitate the style of Vassily Kandinsky. The students mimic Kandinsky’s geometric abstractions, mastering brushwork and learning colour theory. If that was all there were to the lesson, it would be a hands-on class in art history. But the art teacher asks the students to cut up their paintings and build 3D sculptures out of the pieces. They have all started with the same source, but their works all end up looking extremely different: some rise straight up in a column, while others are a jigsaw of different forms and angles. The students learn to treat the past not as a landing point, but as a launching pad. Creativity does not emerge out of thin air. Instead, it is a process of derivation and extrapolation. No idea is ever wholly original; there is always a link from the known to the new. We rely on culture to provide us with a storehouse of raw materials which we then transform. Each generation adds another layer to the cliffside of history. One of the keys to fostering inventiveness is not to treat the past as sacred. Artists and musicians sometimes earn reputations as provocateurs for their irreverent treatment of history – but they are actually doing what is necessary: putting culture on to the workbench and remodelling it. Beethoven didn’t write symphonies because he thought there was anything wrong with Mozart’s. Picasso didn’t paint variations on canvases by Velásquez and Manet because he rejected the old masters, but rather because he revered them. While we sometimes tinker with the imperfect, we also remake what we love, showing our admiration for the past by passing down its DNA. Sometimes inventors attempt to cover their tracks. Stravinsky denied that The Rite of Spring, his revolutionary ballet about pagan Russia, included any actual folk tunes, but scholars found a volume of them in his library after his death. It took Apple seven years to acknowledge that the iPod was based on schematics created by inventor Kane Kramer two decades earlier. But whether it’s obvious or obscured, new ideas always have a family tree. Creative minds always start from a precedent and move from there, but how far should they go? The challenge is that staying too close to the familiar can dissatisfy, while wandering too far can fail to find followers. As a result, inventive people cover the spectrum from the incremental to the disruptive. Thomas Edison made small changes to the telephone, dramatically improved the lightbulb – and at the far end imagined underwater cities powered by solar energy. The designer Norman Bel Geddes designed a host of practical products, such as cocktail shakers and furniture – but he also ranged much further, sketching flying cars and houses in which the walls rose up into the ceiling like garage doors. Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations illustrate the same principle of covering the spectrum from familiar to novel: the first few variations stay recognisably close to what’s come before, and then Beethoven gradually drifts further away until we barely recognise the theme any more. The DNA of the original is still there, but by the end it has evolved to something new. Each of us is creating our own variations on themes passed down to us. We’re at our most inventive when we summon history not to limit our imaginations, but to launch them. That’s a lesson that can start young – and that never ages.

Each day, more than 8 million people drive to work or study – about 78% of all Australians aged over 18 – and three-quarters of all vehicles carry just one person. Worryingly, our cars collectively belch out damaging greenhouse gases at levels roughly the same per year to Queensland’s entire coal and gas-fired electricity supply. Transport is Australia’s third-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, with emissions from transport increasing nearly 60% since 1990, more than any other sector, according to the Climate Council. To halt that trend, we must start choosing smarter and more energy efficient modes of getting from A to B. Use cars sparingly and consider low-emissions vehicles A major solution is to simply drive less, but sometimes that’s not practical and, in rural and regional areas, may even prove impossible. So the type of car used can make a difference. Diesel engines have been hailed as a more sustainable option, as they typically deliver up to 40% better fuel efficiency than petrol, which equals less CO2 emissions. But such engines perform best when towing and driving long-distances. For stop-start city driving, which tends to clog diesel exhaust filtration systems, a small and fuel-efficient petrol engine may prove better. Or – if cash is less of an issue – purchase a hybrid car, which uses a combination of battery technology and a smaller petrol engine. Electric cars, too, are slowly entering the Australian market, but owners must be cautious to charge their vehicles from sustainable sources, rather than coal-fired power sources. To help consumers choose more efficient vehicles, the Australian government-backed Green Vehicle Guide rates cars dating back to 2004 using a colour-coded CO2 emissions meter. Consider joining a car-sharing scheme Already embraced in some European cities, car sharing remains something of a fledgling concept in Australia; most schemes are as yet only available in major capital cities. Yet the concept is promising for short distance city travel: avoid the cost and emissions of owning your own car and instead book from a share fleet only when needed, helping reduce road and carpark congestion – and proving cheaper than taxis and Uber. The City of Sydney has been most proactive in promoting such systems, with about 20% of Sydneysiders now belonging to car-share schemes. The Sydney share fleet alone has taken about 10,000 cars off the road, according to a 2016 report. Consumers can essentially choose from three systems. Companies such as GoGet, Flexicar, GreenShareCar and Student Car Share allow members to book cars from a fleet, usually by the hour or day. Peer-to-peer systems, such as Car Next Door and DriveMyCar operate more like Airbnb – you’re basically renting out your neighbour’s car. Community car-pooling schemes, while still few and far between, are another option. “Car share users get direct personal benefits because they save on transport costs,” says Car Next Door co-founder Will Davies. “They also use public transport and walk and bike more often, which brings more physical activity into their day-to-day lives.” Car Next Door offsets its carbon emissions through non-profit Greenfleet; the scheme’s 60,000 members have helped plant 12,500 trees since 2013. Switch to public transport as much as possible Only 16% of Australians aged over 18 use public transport – many who don’t often say they find services inconvenient and unreliable, or they simply don’t have access to a service at all. While the system can be frustrating in Australia, choosing public transport where possible is doubly beneficial: buses and trains have a far lower environmental impact, and services often improve as patronage increases. Rail transport, especially, is one of the world’s most energy efficient modes of getting around, producing up to five times less greenhouse gases per passenger kilometre than cars. “Many public transport systems around the world, and some in Australia, are switching to 100% renewable energy – cutting pollution even further,” says Petra Stock, Climate Council’s energy and climate systems analyst. A third of Brisbane’s bus fleet runs on compressed natural gas, while Canberra last August began trialling two new electric buses and one hybrid, and may eventually replace the entire fleet. In Adelaide, the council’s electric solar bus Tindo is the world’s first to be recharged using 100% solar energy. Choose the best option: cycling and walking It’s a no-brainer: burning our personal energy rather than fossil fuels is the most sustainable way to get around – and good for our health and hip pockets, too. But few Australians regularly choose active travel, with just one in 26 people usually walking or cycling to work or study. Again, the sheer size of our country is partly to blame. But for city dwellers and those who live close to work, active transport is attractive when the maths is considered. “Owning and operating a car costs about $225 per week, not including parking,” the Bicycle Queensland chief executive, Anne Savage, says. “Riding 10km to and from work regularly will save the average household at least $1,700 per year in transport costs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1.5 tonnes annually.” Plus riding to work can dramatically lower the risk of heart disease and cancer, Savage says. These days, one doesn’t even need to own a bike. Sharing schemes such as Reddy Go, oBike, ofo and mobike all operate via mobile phone apps, while many major cities also offer local sharing systems. And if puffing up hills puts you off, consider electric bikes (ideally if you have solar power at home for recharging). Going carless won’t always be possible, but considering more sustainable modes of transport can make a big difference.

Look around any urban centre and you’ll see the built environment itself exacerbates summer temperatures. Vehicles stuck in traffic emitting heat. Airconditioners pumping waste heat into the air. Concrete and asphalt across almost every surface, absorbing and radiating the sun’s rays. Urban canyons formed between tall buildings, trapping heat at the street level. All these factors contribute towards a phenomenon called the “urban heat island” effect, which results in cities being up to 10C hotter than the surrounding countryside. How do we to tackle this? A typical response on a hot day might be to turn up the aircon. But this fuels a vicious circle of heating the outdoors to cool the indoors, making external spaces more uncomfortable still, and at a significant cost. Airconditioning currently accounts for around one-fifth of building-related global electricity usage, or 2.5 timesthe total electricity use in Africa. A thermal imaging photograph of Sydney shows high surface temperatures of asphalt roads and buildings, with lower temperatures in the shade With a warming climate and rapid population growth in hotter, increasingly wealthy countries, our use of airconditioning is set to skyrocket in what the International Energy Agency calls a “looming cold crunch”. They estimate that the energy needed for cooling buildings will triple by 2050 – a growth equivalent to the current electricity demand in the USA and Germany combined. Yet our disproportionately warm cities do not simply pose an energy challenge. Ultimately, urban temperature presents us with life-or-death situations; an increase in mortality and strokes is reported when temperatures head above 25C. In the US heatwaves kill more people on average than any other natural disaster, while in the UK heat-related deaths are set to increase 257% by 2050 and 535% by 2080. And it is not just an issue in hot countries – in Moscow an estimated 11,000 people died due to a heatwave in 2010. The Cityscape: get the best of Guardian Cities delivered to you every week, with just-released data, features and on-the-ground reports from all over the world With the frequency and intensity of heatwaves increasing we need to urgently tackle the excess heat we face both inside our buildings, and in our cities’ outside spaces. Fortunately, there are many ways in which we can mitigate the urban heat island effect – while also creating more attractive places to live, work and play. Gardens in the sky As is obvious to anyone who has sat under a tree on a hot day, vegetation can be a powerful tool in the fight against excessive city heat. Not only does greenery provide shade, it stimulates evapotranspiration, the process by which water evaporating from plants’ leaves reduces the adjacent air temperature. Many cities recognise the value of parks and trees for urban cooling, not to mention residents’ psychological wellbeing, but few have embraced greenery to the extent of Singapore. The city-state embarked on its ambitious “garden city” plan in 1967 through intensive tree-planting and the creation of new parks. As the population grew and buildings got taller, the focus shifted to include skyrise greenery encompassing “skygardens”, vertical planting and green roofs. Today Singapore accommodates 100 hectares (240 acres) of skyrise greenery, with plans to increase this to 200 ha by 2030 – an area equivalent to Regent’s Park. This growth is fuelled by building regulations such as the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (Lush) policy. Lush requires any new building to include areas of greenery equivalent to the size of the development site. These can be at ground level or at height, and often include luxuriantly planted balconies, shaded skygardens and vertical green walls – which can help cause temperatures to drop by 2-3ºC. Green buildings in Singapore Many new buildings go far beyond the minimum required. The Oasia Hotel, designed by WOHA Architects, accommodates greenery across virtually every surface. Wrapped in a dramatic 200m-tall planted trellis, the building almost drips with vegetation, and is wildly at odds with the corporate steel and glass of many urban structures. “We’ve almost created, in some ways, the notion of a huge tree in the city,” says Wong Mun Summ, Founding Director at WOHA. “[It’s] a device in the city that really supports a thriving eco-system three-dimensionally in a very dense environment.” The result is a building that accommodates greenery equivalent to 11 times its own footprint. As well as cooling, such abundant vegetation contributes many other benefits too – absorbing pollutants from the air, producing oxygen and creating a calming, natural setting within the hyper-dense city. Reflective roofs If we are to make cities cooler we must also change the materials they’re built from. Urban areas are dominated by dark and hard materials – concrete, asphalt, paving – most of which absorb, rather than reflect, solar radiation. According to Australia’s Cooperative Research Centre for Low Carbon Living, conventional paving can reach temperatures up to 67C and conventional roofs up to 50–90C on a hot day. Such temperatures can have significant health impacts. According to Arthur Rosenfeld of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, living on the top floor of a building with a dark roof was identified as a risk factor of mortality in the 1995 heatwave in Chicago. “Government has a role to ban or phase out the use of black or dark roofs, at least in warm climates, because they pose a large negative health risk,” he said. The best way to overcome this is to use cool coatings– typically lighter pigments in asphalt or white-coloured coatings applied to roads, roofs and facades, which reflect more solar energy away from the city. Trials of a reflective road coating in Los Angeles The New York Cools Roofs initiative, for example, has seen more than 500,000m² of roof space covered in a white reflective coating, saving an estimated 2,282 tonnes of CO2 per year from cooling emissions. Cool roofs are installed at no cost in public buildings, for non-profit organisations and in affordable housing. In other buildings free labour for installation is offered by the city with the owner just paying for the materials. It may sound simple, but the results can be significant – research by Nasa has suggested a white roof could be 23C (42F) cooler than a typical black roof on the hottest day of the New York summer. In Los Angeles, it’s roads, not roofs, that arethe challenge. More than 10% of the city’s land area is black asphalt, which absorbs up to 95% of the sun’s energy, contributing to the urban heat island. The city is responding by painting roads in a white-coloured sealant with a high reflectivity, at a cost of $40,000 per mile. Initial measurements suggest a reduction in temperature of 10-15ºF, though one road was found to be as much as 23F cooler after painting. Water: a tool to cool Water has been used as a tool to cool cities for centuries. The 14th century palace of Alhambra, for example, housed courtyards with pools and arching fountains, stimulating the evaporation of water and cooling the hot, dry Andalusian air. The contemporary heat-proof city could follow suit, accommodating ponds, pools, fountains, sprinklers and misting systems to cool outdoor spaces. Chongqing is known as one of the “three furnaces” of the Yangtze River Delta, given its long hot summers. To provide moments of relief, the city is experimenting by using water misters at local bus stops. These spray clouds of water chilled to 5-7C, cooling the air as well as the waiting passengers. Combining water with other urban cooling strategies can yield significant temperature reductions. The University of New South Wales, the CRCLCL and Sydney Water studied the urban heat island effect in western Sydney, where temperatures can often be 6–10C hotter than the coastal regions of the city little more than 15 miles away and found that adding water features and cool coatings would reduce cooling requirements by 29–43% and lower the overall average air temperature by 1.5C. Temperatures taken adjacent to water features were up to 10C lower, the study found. Dynamic shades One of the challenges in keeping the built environment cool is overreliance on fully-glazed facades. Many windows permit desirable natural light and views but can mean buildings trap unwanted heat in summer and don’t retain it in winter. We can easily design shading systems to protect buildings from the sun, but for the best possible results, these shading systems need to move in tune with the local weather and the path of the sun. A radical example is in Abu Dhabi, where summer temperatures rise as high as 48C and buildings need to be shielded from the harsh desert sun. The Al Bahr Towers take inspiration from a Middle Eastern shading device known as a mashrabiya. Historically, these are wooden screens, patterned with Islamic geometry to allow for filtered light and views while protecting inhabitants from the intensity of the sun. But the modern mashrabiya in the Al Bahr Towers move to create a dramatic, adaptable façade, estimated to reduce the building’s CO2 emissions by 20%. The exterior of Al Bahr towers in Abu Dhabi A building management system operates 1,049 hexagon-shaped shades, opening and closing them like flowers. Their movements follow the sun, shading the parts of the building in direct sunlight but opening up to allow for natural light as the sun moves by. The result is a constantly changing and adapting façade, one that reflects daily and seasonal patterns of weather, climate and occupation and responds to changing needs of heat and light. Adaptable buildings and infrastructure like this one, which can morph to respond to different seasons and weather events, will be crucial in the future battle to keep cool and comfortable in a warming climate.

However, on average these outages represent a much smaller quantity of lost generation compared to the day-to-day intermittency of wind or solar. Nuclear plants spend a high proportion of the time generating at their maximum capacity. On emissions, some proponents of both nuclear and renewables do fall into the habit of referring to their technologies as “zero-carbon”, even though there are some greenhouse gas emissions produced with all forms of generation. But there is remarkable academic agreement that the emissions from nuclear, wind, solar and many other non-fossil generation sources are similarly low per unit of electricity generated and these emissions are tiny fractions of those associated with burning coal and gas. We desperately need to cut emissions in our electricity mix to as low as possible. The nuclear industry’s Harmony programme has a goal of 25% of the world’s electricity being supplied by nuclear energy by 2050. The remaining 75% would need to be supplied by a broad mix of other almost zero-carbon generation options, alongside energy storage and smart grids to help deal with intermittent generation and variable demand. We should work together for a strong, clean future for electricity generation rather than quibble while coal burns. Agneta Rising Director general, World Nuclear Association • The simple engineering facts that solar only functions less than one-third of the day and wind only functions when winds are just right mean that they are unreliable and must be backed up at a moment’s notice. In most areas, that’s by burning gas in low-efficiency “peaker” turbine plants that never get shut off fully to protect their expensive equipment. So, wind/solar energy is far from free, has high related emissions and is far more expensive than a nuclear plant that runs 90% of every year for decades. Nuclear power provides far better capacity, stability, longevity and jobs than can wind/solar enterprises, all while providing local communities with reliable power and great economic benefit to boot. The combustion industry loves renewables because their use commits poorly informed electorates and legislatures to installing emissions-producing backup.

The most obvious would be to pursue the following line: hit hard by the effects of climate change, the world can save itself by building a sustainable future in renewable technology. It’s also a message that falls squarely in the tell-us-something-we-don’t-know box. Many moons have passed – and much discussion has transpired – since Al Gore brought us the world’s first blockbuster powerpoint presentation, 2006’s An Inconvenient Truth. That film ended with what is now considered a cliché in environmental documentaries: a “what can I do to help?” section intended to turn audiences into campaigners. For her Sundance-supported feature documentary debut Catching the Sun, which screens in Australia as part of environmental documentary film festival Transitions this month, film-maker and activist Shalini Kantayya took a different route. She framed the discussion not as a “world gone to hell” prophecy of doom but as the means to argue renewable tech is – or can be – all about the economy, stupid. The film begins in Richmond, Virginia, a place that acts as a symbolic stand-in for any number of other American cities. The manufacturing industry, long its backbone, has withered and unemployment is rife. A program called Solar Richmond creates “green-job opportunities”. It equips citizens, often those from rough-and-tumble neighbourhoods, with skills necessary for employment in solar panel installation. As one interviewee puts it: “You can’t talk in a neighbourhood like this about saving the polar bear. They’re not gonna feel ya.” What they can feel is the difference between being trained and ready for employment and living on welfare. This is where Kantayya starts – the issue of job creation – viewing the word “renewable” in both an environmental and economic context. “When I went to the Solar Richmond training program, I thought this is a symbol for the kind of transformation all cities must make if we’re going to move our global economy towards a renewable future,” she says. “I really got excited with that idea, which is really about the economics. Could solar do for America what the automotive industry did?” Catching the Sun largely ignores the kinds of discussion about climate change synonymous with binary politics, and is intended for intelligent audiences who don’t need to be convinced about the environmental benefits of clean energy. It has already screened in front of people for whom its messages about financial opportunity could make an impact – including at COP21 and for 100 mayors from around the world, at the invitation of the US secretary of state, John Kerry. “One of the most moving things about the film is that it is actually reaching policymakers,” says Kantayya. “Solar energy isn’t just good for the polar bears, it’s good for the middle class and the working class,” says the director. “I found in the many years making this film that there’s a story that’s not been told – that solar energy is the foremost economic opportunity of our time.” One interesting case study is staunch conservative Debbie Dooley, one of the founding members of the US’s Tea Party and a participant in the documentary. She is also an outspoken advocate for solar energy. This may be generally perceived as a left-leaning cause, but Dooley is adamant her passion for solar is because of her ideological beliefs, not despite them. Kantayya says her and Dooley’s political opinions are diametrically opposed (“We don’t talk about any other issues, let’s be clear,” she says, chuckling). But she views their collaboration as representative of the potential to break down barriers. “I think our friendship is a symbol of what can be possible when we push our differences aside – this labelling of left and right – and say: what is it that we actually both want? “Arguably the most environmental president [the US] has ever had was Richard Nixon. He gave us the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act. All of those things were signed under Nixon and you can hardly call him a granola hippy.” Catching the Sun arrives at an interesting time in Australia. Freed from the weird cheerleading of Tony “Coal is good for humanity” Abbott, there is a sense that a corner has been turned. In January, two new solar plants (now the largest in the country) were formally opened in Nyngan and Broken Hill, prompting speculation they may signal the “the birth of large-scale solar”. The Asia-Pacific manager for First Solar, which partnered with AGL, said costs for large-scale solar have fallen about 30% in recent years. Uptake for individual homes and offices remains high, with recent data revealing more than 1.5m Australian homes have rooftop solar panels. And last month an Australian family became the first in the country to get a Tesla Powerwall unit installed. But the danger is that political seesawing and changes in policy will stymie growth. Recently in Nevada, for example, thousands of workers were let go after the state’s energy commission passed rules that roll back solar incentives. Similarly energy campaigners in the UK blamed government policy for the collapse of two solar panel installers last year. Kantayya reiterates the message that governments should “send strong signals to the business community” and believes root-and-branch reform has to be a part of it: “The rewiring of our energy system is also going to involve the rewiring of our political system.” She singles out Germany’s feed-in tariff, which pays individual people to be power producers, as an example of an effective initiative. “A large portion of the solar that came to Germany was actually owned by ordinary people. Industrialists were almost left out of Germany’s solar revolution.” Catching the Sun does, by the way, end with that eco-activist doco cliché: a call-to-action imploring audiences to contact their elected officials. But the film is so logically argued, and advocates such highly pragmatic workable solutions, you can hardly fault it for doing so. “Of course we need to make big federal changes but it is about ordinary citizens going to their local government, going to their state governments, and saying this is what we want.” • Catching the Sun is part of Transitions Film festival.

The row has erupted after a key polar satellite broke down a few days ago, leaving the US with only three ageing ones, each operating long past their shelf lives, to measure the Arctic’s dwindling ice cap. Scientists say there is no chance a new one can now be launched until 2023 or later. None of the current satellites will still be in operation then. The crisis has been worsened because the US Congress this year insisted that a backup sea-ice probe had to be dismantled because it did not want to provide funds to keep it in storage. Congress is currently under the control of Republicans, who are antagonistic to climate science and the study of global warming. “This is like throwing away the medical records of a sick patient,” said David Gallaher of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado. “Our world is ailing and we have apparently decided to undermine, quite deliberately, the effectiveness of the records on which its recovery might be based. It is criminal.” The threat to the US sea-ice monitoring programme – which supplies data to scientists around the world – will trigger further accusations at this week’s international climate talks in Bonn that the Trump administration is trying to block studies of global warming for ideological reasons. Earth’s sea ice has shrunk dramatically – particularly in the Arctic – in recent years as rising emissions of greenhouse gases have warmed the planet. Satellites have been vital in assessing this loss, thanks mainly to America’s Defence Meteorological Satellite Programme (DMSP), which has overseen the construction of eight F-series satellites that use microwaves sensors to monitor sea-ice coverage. These probes, which have lifespans of three to five years, have shown that millions of square kilometres of sea ice have disappeared from the Arctic over the past 20 years, allowing less solar energy to be reflected back into space – and so further increasing global temperatures – while also disrupting Inuit life and wildlife in the region. At present three ageing satellites – DMSP F16, F17 and F18 – remain in operation, though they are all beginning to drift out of their orbits over the poles. The latest satellite in the series, F19, began to suffer sensor malfunctions last year and finally broke down a few weeks ago. It should have been replaced with the F20 probe, which had already been built and was being kept in storage by the US Air Force. However it had to be destroyed, on the orders of the US Congress, on the grounds that its storage was too costly. Many scientists say this decision was made for purely ideological reasons. They also warn that many other projects for monitoring climate change, including several satellite missions, face similar threats from the Trump administration and Congress. Such losses have serious consequences, say researchers. “Sea-ice data provided by satellites is essential for initiating climate models and validating them,” said Andrew Fleming of the British Antarctic Survey. “We will be very much the poorer without that information.” The heading, standfirst and first paragraph of this article were amended on 8 November 2017 after an editing intervention erroneously accused President Donald Trump of obstructing satellite research into climate change.

He shouldn’t have been so surprised. Ross is the mayor of Georgetown, population 65,000, and he has become a minor celebrity in environmental circles as a result of a pioneering decision in 2015 to get all the city’s electricity from renewable sources. Georgetown’s location in oil-and-gas-centric Texas and Ross’s politics add to the strangeness of the tale. The mayor is a staunch Republican at a time when a Republican president – and his Environmental Protection Agency administrator – reject the scientific consensus on climate change and are trying to revive the declining coal industry. Ross has appeared in a National Geographic documentary, a forthcoming film about clean energy for HBO directed by James Redford (son of Robert) and in this year’s follow-up to An Inconvenient Truth, which saw the advocate and former vice-president Al Gore visit Georgetown. The day after we met at city hall, just off Georgetown’s charming main square, Ross was set to fly to Utah to introduce a screening of An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power. Then it was on to Las Vegas to reunite with Gore, a fellow speaker at Friday’s National Clean Energy Summit, an event co-hosted by Reid, a Democrat from Nevada. Next week, a conference in Oakland, California. Next month, a green energy panel in Nova Scotia. “You should see the fan mail that I get, especially with the movies,” Ross grinned. The 58-year-old said the decision to follow the lead of Burlington, Vermont – the first US city to run solely on renewable energy – was not the product of liberal do-gooder vapours wafting up Interstate 35 from nearby Austin. It was based on cold-eyed pragmatism, the fruit of the kind of careful numerical analysis he performs in his day job as a certified public accountant. “The revolution is here,” he said. “And I’m a good little Republican, a rightwing fiscal conservative, but when it comes to making decisions based on facts, that’s what we do.” The facts, Ross said, are that when Georgetown negotiated power supply deals the cost was about the same between natural gas and wind and solar, but the natural gas option would provide only a seven-year guaranteed contract whereas 20-25 year proposals were on the table from renewable providers. Georgetown officials decided to lock in a long-term rate to eliminate price volatility, mindful of the risk that future government actions might send fossil fuel costs soaring. Prices in the city, Ross said, have declined from 11.4¢ per kilowatt hour in 2008 to 8.5¢ this year. Georgetown sources most of its power from a wind farm 500 miles away in Amarillo and will get solar energy from a farm in west Texas that is expected to be finished next June, meaning the city can attain its 100% renewable goal even when the wind isn’t blowing. This year, Ross said, the tally is about 90%, down from 100% in 2016. “I think it’s a big step for Texas, for Georgetown,” said Christian Soeffker, who runs a toy shop on the square. “We just like the idea of being in a town that is in some ways special because we’ve got all that green energy.” Georgetown makes headlines not only because so few US cities run entirely on renewables, but because it has a conservative mayor willing to make compromises and fraternise with high-profile Democrats in a hyper-partisan era where climate change is one of the most divisive subjects. “How is anybody going to compete with wind and solar?” said Ross, who has ordered an electric-powered BMW scooter from California and plans to fit solar panels at his home and office. All the same, he voted for coal’s biggest champion in last November’s presidential election – Trump was “like, my eighth or ninth choice” in the primary, he said – and went to his inauguration, which he said was “phenomenal”, even if it cost $700 for a basic hotel room. His support is not unquestioning, though. “When Trump was campaigning he was talking about clean coal and we’re going to bring coal jobs back? That is a mirage, that is not going to happen,” he said. “Coal is one of the most expensive forms of fossil fuels to produce. And those jobs are never going to come back, ever. They’re done.” As for any policies the federal government might enact to boost the coal industry, such as the decision announced on Tuesday to scrap the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan? “Isn’t that sort of like putting a Band-Aid on somebody that has terminal cancer?” Ross said. “I’m not the smartest guy in the room but it’s not that complicated, OK? How’s fossil fuels going to compete in the next five years? They’re not going to be able to compete.” ‘We have so much that is ideal for solar’ Texas is the US leader in wind energy capacity, even as many of its politicians maintain absolute fealty to fossil fuels that are a key economic driver and still the supplier of most of the state’s electricity. It has lagged behind other states in solar capacity but is starting to realise its potential. “We have so much area in Texas that’s ideal for solar,” said Joey Romano, a 35-year-old with a small solar farm 50 miles west of downtown Houston. “Solar and wind, unsubsidised, today already can compete with coal,” he said. Local Sun has about 100 residential customers. Completed at the end of 2015, the farm is located in a rural county that gave Trump 79% of the vote. But Romano said local officials recognised the potential for jobs and revenue and were happy to help the project get off the ground. Beehives stand among the 15,000 panels. “We call the programme ‘farm-to-market solar energy’,” Romano said, at his office in central Houston. Local Sun is a boutique operation in partnership with MP2 Energy, a retail company owned by Shell, and it is designed to attract those willing to pay a small premium for an eco-conscious local product, much as food shoppers might spend a little more for organic groceries. However modest, its very existence feels like a significant marker in a city that is known as America’s oil and gas capital but is in fact the nation’s biggest municipal user of green power. On the other hand, environmental activists worry that solar’s growth will be stunted in Texas and across the country if, as appears likely, the Trump White House imposes prohibitive tariffs on imported solar panels. “They may harm thousands of installation jobs in favour of a few hundred manufacturing jobs, so that could hurt,” said Jim Marston of the Environmental Defense Fund, who believes renewable energy will thrive even if federal incentives end and barriers are erected. “You can’t stop the technology. It’s too good, the prices are too good, and people want it,” he said. Ross agrees that market forces will prevail. On Friday, the day of the clean energy summit, Texas’s largest electricity producer announced it would close two more coal-fuelled power plants in the state. Luminant cited challenging economic conditions including low wholesale and natural gas prices and the growth of renewables. A week earlier, the company said that in January it will retire a large coal-powered plant in east Texas. “We were on the frontier of the fossil fuel business, oil and gas,” Ross said. “And now Texas again is on the frontier of the new energy that’s going to be the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/jun/19/john-oliver-coal-industry-miners-trump-lies","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-19T14:42:45Z","webTitle":"John Oliver on the coal industry: 'Trump needs to stop lying to miners'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/19/john-oliver-coal-industry-miners-trump-lies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/19/john-oliver-coal-industry-miners-trump-lies","fields":{"headline":"John Oliver on the coal industry: 'Trump needs to stop lying to miners'","bodyText":"John Oliver addressed the topic of coal mining on his show Sunday night, exploring the industry’s loss of jobs and the factors that have led to it. “Coal,” he began, “basically cocaine for Thomas the Tank Engine. We’ve heard a lot about coal this past year, particularly from President Trump. In fact, arguably the key reason that we have this cautionary Bible story in the White House was his ability to connect with mining communities during the campaign.” Oliver showed clips of Trump galvanizing voters at campaign rallies by promising to bring back coal industry jobs, putting on a hard hat, and doing a mining gesture on stage. “Let me stop you right there. It is not easy watching someone I doubt has done a day of hard labor in his life show how he thinks coal mining works,” Oliver said, before showing an interview with the EPA head, Scott Pruitt, in which he claimed 50,000 coal mining jobs had been created since Trump took office. “But Trump’s promising to bring back coal jobs is undeniably potent and, to listen to his EPA administrator, it’s a promise that he’s already keeping. “So the only problem there is that those numbers are bullshit,” Oliver quipped. “The Bureau of Labor Statistics have the actual number of coal jobs created since last year at just 1,300, so that 50,000 new jobs claims was off by 48,700. Which, for this administration, is actually uncharacteristically accurate.” Oliver went on to catalogue the administration’s efforts thus far to revive the coal industry: “There is no doubt Trump claims coal is a huge priority for his White House, and let’s set aside the fact that it is environmentally catastrophic. Which we shouldn’t, because it is, but this person clearly doesn’t care about that. We pulled out of the Paris agreement citing coal as one of the reasons. He’s lifted a freeze on new coal leases on public lands, and revoked a rule to limit coal mining companies from dumping debris into local streams. So, if coal jobs are so important to him, let’s talk about them.” Oliver explained how Bob Murray, the CEO of Murray Energy, has for years been peddling the idea that Obama-era regulations were a death knell for coal jobs. “Coal mining jobs undoubtedly did decline under Obama, but it’s worth noting that coal mining jobs have also been declining for decades,” Oliver said, displaying a graph charting the rapid descent of coal industry jobs. “Just look at that trend line: coal industry jobs declined at roughly the same rate as a career in the zeppelin industry and babies named Adolf. Some still exist – there’s just not nearly as many of them anymore.” He went on: “And I’m not saying Obama’s regulations had no effect, but researchers have found that they had very little impact relative to other factors. When they studied the decline in expected demand for coal from a decade ago, they found that nearly half of that drop was owing to the drop in natural gas prices, and another 18% was due to the growth in renewable energy, like wind and solar. And there is perhaps no more dramatic evidence of coal losing out to solar energy than this.” Oliver then showed a news clip about the Kentucky Coal Mining Museum, which is estimated to have saved nearly $10,000 by using alternative energy sources: “It’s true,” he said. “The Kentucky Coal Mining Museum is now using solar energy. It’s like finding out the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame was brought to you by Smash Mouth.” Coal mining, like almost all industries, is facing increased automation,” Oliver said. “And I say that well aware that in five to 10 years, I’m probably going to be replaced by a robotic English tea kettle that screams depressing money stats at you. “Trump needs to stop lying to coal miners. We all do,” he concluded."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/04/brazil-raises-hopes-of-a-retreat-from-new-mega-dam-construction","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T17:56:42Z","webTitle":"Brazil raises hopes of a retreat from new mega-dam construction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/04/brazil-raises-hopes-of-a-retreat-from-new-mega-dam-construction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/04/brazil-raises-hopes-of-a-retreat-from-new-mega-dam-construction","fields":{"headline":"Brazil raises hopes of a retreat from new mega-dam construction","bodyText":"After swathes of forest clearance, millions of tonnes of concrete and decades of hydro-expansion, Brazil has raised hopes that it may finally step back from the construction of new mega-dams. In a surprise statement, a senior government official said hydropower policy needed to be rethought in the face of environmental concerns, indigenous sensitivities and public unease. Anti-dam activists welcomed the apparent shift, despite scepticism about the declared motives, which they believe mask a drying up of bribes from the construction industry. The decision could reprieve the Tapajos and free-flowing rivers from a plan to open half the Amazon basin to hydro-development. Brazil already gets more than 70% of its electricity from hydropower – one of the highest proportions in the world. Until recently, most of the generating capacity came from plants near the southern border and the economic hubs of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte. But in recent years, the dam builders – backed by the Workers’ party administrations of Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – pushed north into the Amazon with the huge Belo Monte project on the Xingu river, despite environmental concerns, court battles and fierce resistance from indigenous residents. The Tapajos was the next major river in the sights of the consortium led by utility Eletrobras and major construction firms such as Odebrecht. Two dams have already been completed on the Teles Pires tributary and hundreds more were planned elsewhere. But the momentum has diminished along with falling government revenues, sluggish economic demand and an increasingly unpredictable climate that has made hydropower generation less reliable and more expensive. Opponents have capitalised on this. After indigenous demonstration and critical scientific studies, the environment agency rejected a licence application for a dam at São Luiz do Tapajós which would have flooded Munduruku indigenous territory. The current centre-right government of Michel Temer now appears to be considering a far bigger retreat. “We don’t hold preconceptions about big projects, but we have to respect the views of society, which has reservations about them,” said Paulo Pedrosa, the executive secretary of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, in an interview with O Globo newspaper. Government studies suggest Brazil could add 50 gigawatts of hydroenergy by 2050, but Pedrosa noted that less than a quarter of the necessary dams would be free from challenges over protected land. Pedrosa said such costs should not be hidden, an apparent reference to the Rousseff administration’s refusal to heed warnings about the Belo Monte dam, which has since proved a social and environmental disaster. The Car Wash corruption investigation exposed how the Workers’ party received campaign donations from Odebrecht in return for over-inflated contracts to build Belo Monte and other infrastructure projects. Now the kickbacks have dried up, government officials have little incentive to cover up the social and environmental costs of future projects. Few believe the Temer administration is any cleaner or greener. It is closely allied to the agribusiness lobby, which is primarily responsible for Amazon clearance. Last year, the government also attempted to open up protected areas to mining companies. But it is in the process of privisatising Eletrobras, which will mean the economic feasibility of mega-projects will come under greater scrutiny, particularly with wind and solar energy becoming more viable. The government will propose a new model for project evaluation to Congress this year that takes greater account of costs. “Current projects when priced appropriately - including transmission costs, risks associated with the seasonality of energy and the possible delay of works - show them to be much less competitive than in previous assessments,” the Ministry of Mines and Energy noted in an email response to The Guardian. It is unlikely to be a complete panacea Given the pro-business stance of the ruling coalition, there are fears that other environmental licensing criteria may be weakened. With a presidential election in October, any changes of policy could also be rapidly reversed, but anti-dam activists hold out hope this - in regard to mega-projects at least - this will be a turning point. “The Brazilian government’s announcement validates what scientists, indigenous activists and economists have long known: that these costly, corrupt hydropower projects are destroying lives, livelihoods and the vibrant ecosystem of the Amazon, the lungs of the planet,” Kate Horner, executive director of International Rivers, said. “Brazil can meet its energy needs without mega-dams, and now it will finally get the chance.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/29/tsb-woes-britain-nation-tech-dunces","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T06:00:37Z","webTitle":"Don’t let TSB’s woes convince you Britain is a nation of tech dunces","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/29/tsb-woes-britain-nation-tech-dunces","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/29/tsb-woes-britain-nation-tech-dunces","fields":{"headline":"Don’t let TSB’s woes convince you Britain is a nation of tech dunces","bodyText":"It was all so different for Paul Pester last December. Unveiling TSB’s new banking platform, he claimed that it had created “a more digital, agile and flexible TSB”. Before last weekend’s switch to the new system, TSB’s press office said that almost everything was running on the new platform; there was only the little matter of transferring 1.3bn account details for 5 million customers, and all would be done. Now, Pester finds himself presiding over another example of a great British IT failure. In the same week, outsourcing company Capita, which has had problems with contracts with GP surgeries and London’s congestion charge, said it was seeking a £701m rights issue as part of an overhaul that includes rebuilding its technology and IT infrastructure. Meanwhile, the government has found itself in even further trouble over the Windrush scandal due to the Home Office’s inability to digitise a set of landing cards from 70 years ago. And that’s before we talk about the stuttering, long-delayed rollout of universal credit. Is it that Britain is just bad at IT projects? You don’t have to look far to find examples at the banks: each of NatWest, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and RBS have had “glitches” of greater or lesser impact in the past few years. BT took a big writedown on a calamitous NHS computerisation nearly a decade ago. In the private or public sector, there seems to be a record of messing up. But it’s easy to get the wrong impression. We generally don’t hear about all the projects that go right, because we just expect ATMs to serve us money, or tills to work, or unseen globe-spanning search engines to return results, or apps on our phones to open. TSB’s customers had already been using the platform behind last week’s crisis for almost everything, apart from their accounts; Sabadell, the Spanish parent of TSB, built the technology over nearly three years, building on earlier technology from Accenture. This wasn’t a rush job. However, TSB’s chiefs may have forgotten the longstanding rule of IT projects: completing the first 80% of it takes 80% of your time – and the last 20% takes another 80%. Managers who insist on hitting calendar targets probably aren’t familiar with the endless testing that computer systems and code need. To think that the UK excels at being bad at IT projects, though, is unnecessary self-flagellation. In the US, public and private mess up too: the launch of the Healthcare.gov site in 2013 was calamitously bad, with only a tiny percentage of people able to use it at first. It improved, but there were red faces all round. In September 2014, Apple pushed out a software update for the iPhone that killed its phone capability (it was quickly reverted). And Facebook, of course, allowed the personal data of more than 80 million people to be scraped from its site. The difficulty is that software, unlike a steel beam, is hard to test for use in different environments; Nasa has managed to write error-free code, but it takes years of effort for comparatively short programs. The general level of sophistication in how software is written is “in the hunter-gatherer stage”, according to one professor studying it: professional code is full of bugs which have to be fixed, which often exposes other underlying bugs. The interaction between code on different systems can be unpredictable. And meanwhile managers want it done to a budget and a date. In fact, there’s life in the IT project business. Capita says it will now focus on five outsourcing areas rather than 40; two of the survivors are software and IT outsourcing. Its results show that both had better profit margins than other divisions. Software is the future; and we aren’t that bad at it. Powerful case for UK to get on board with onshore windfarms When the UK went without coal for three days this week, it was wind turbines that provided much of the power to keep the lights on. Contrary to what the Conservative party might have you think, people like windfarms. New government polling shows support for offshore windfarms is at a record high, with 83% of the public backing them. Even onshore windfarms, which energy minister Claire Perry said the Tories had blocked because they were “just so controversial”, are now more popular than ever. For the first time, more than three-quarters of the public (76%) say they support them. Solar energy has 87% in favour. During the coal-free run, the government boasted that the UK’s “world-leading renewables” were going from strength to strength. Yet while there is more billpayer subsidy earmarked for offshore windfarms, there is still no support for solar and onshore wind power. Perry said she was now “looking carefully” at helping onshore windfarms to be built in Scotland and Wales. More offshore wind is great. The UK is reaping the rewards for its leadership there – witness GE choosing the UK to test its new 12MW turbine, the world’s most powerful. But onshore windfarms are still significantly cheaper. Research has found they could be built without consumers paying any subsidy and for the same price as new gas power plants. Big firms are lining up to say they want to build more onshore wind power. Innogy, Vattenfall, SSE and ScottishPower are among the firms keen to develop windfarms in Scotland and Wales. Unlike nuclear plants, onshore windfarms can be built quickly. Public and political debates on energy are dominated by the cost of bills, of price caps. What better time to unblock the cheapest source of green power? Beast from the east isn’t to blame for GDP slump – it’s the frozen wages It’s easy to read too much into a single set of figures, but Friday’s combination of almost zero GDP growth and rising personal insolvencies presents the British government with a gloomy economic health check. Back in 2015 there were fewer than 20,000 personal insolvencies. In the first quarter of 2018 the total reached 27,388 – which was the highest quarterly figure recorded since 2012. A fall in GDP growth from 0.4% in the last three months of 2017 to 0.1% in the first three months of 2018 was even more disturbing. This first estimate of economic output showed that the UK’s building industry is struggling and the manufacturing sector becalmed. The service industries continue to expand, especially banks in the Square Mile, but not at the pace seen at the height of the recovery in 2015. One-off factors may have played a part, though apparently not the “beast from the east” cold snap that chancellor Philip Hammond reached for as an explanation. A more convincing explanation is the damaging effect of falling real wages over the last year. Without inflation-busting pay rises, it was little surprise that household spending, for so long the heart of the economy, would start to wane. The Treasury, meanwhile, is sitting pretty. It has refused to give government employees and welfare recipients an income increase of any significance and continued the squeeze on departmental spending, capping its costs. Yet it has benefited from the modest rise in private-sector wages, which have boosted PAYE tax receipts, while higher prices in the shops have lifted VAT receipts. As result the budget deficit at the end of March fell to its lowest level since 2007. Labour and the unions are right to complain that this situation is unsustainable. By sapping middle- and low-income households of funds, it might boost its own finances, but it undermines the long-term strength of the British economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/sep/05/morocco-to-give-600-mosques-a-green-makeover","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-05T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"Morocco to give 600 mosques a green makeover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/05/morocco-to-give-600-mosques-a-green-makeover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/05/morocco-to-give-600-mosques-a-green-makeover","fields":{"headline":"Morocco to give 600 mosques a green makeover","bodyText":"Six hundred “green mosques” are to be created in Morocco by March 2019 in a national consciousness-raising initiative that aims to speed the country’s journey to clean energy. If all goes to plan, the green revamp will see LED lighting, solar thermal water heaters and photovoltaic systems installed in 100 mosques by the end of this year. Morocco’s ministry of Islamic affairs is underwriting the innovative scheme, paying up to 70% of the initial investment costs in a partnership with the German government. Jan-Christophe Kuntze, the project’s chief, said: “We want to raise awareness and mosques are important centres of social life in Morocco. They are a place where people exchange views about all kinds of issues including, hopefully, why renewables and energy efficiency might be a good idea.” Morocco has established itself as a regional climate leader with high-profile projects, ranging from the largest windfarm in Africa to an enormous solar power plant in the Sahara desert, which opened earlier this year. In November, Marrakech will host the COP22 climate summit to discuss preparations for implementing the Paris climate agreement. The country’s environment minister, Hakima el-Haité, told the Guardian that religion could make a powerful contribution to the clean energy debate, shortly before an Islamic declaration on climate change last year. “It is very important for Muslim countries to come back to their traditions and remind people that we are miniscule as humans before the importance of the earth,” she said. “We need to protect it, and to save humankind in the process.” The new green mosques project plans to do this with established technologies that can be adapted to public buildings and residential homes. By training electricians, technicians and auditors, it hopes to direct Morocco’s clean energy along the path followed by German’s Energiewende, (energy transition). But Kuntze stressed that Germany was offering technological support, rather than financial opportunities for its own industries. “We are not representing any German business interests at all,” he said. “The good thing about this project is that the Moroccan government came up with the idea themselves. It is something new and really innovative and it has not been tried anywhere else before, to my knowledge.” The initiative has broken new ground for gender equality in Morocco too. Many mourchidates (female clerics) have been involved in the project, as well as imams, and about a quarter of the participants in recent seminars have been women, Kuntze said. Under the project’s energy service contract model, contractors will eventually be paid by the energy savings generated from the clean power systems they install. As the renovations should cut the mosques’ electricity usage by 40%, these should be substantial. The first 100 mosques to get a green makeover are mostly based in big population centres – such as Rabat, Fez, Marrakech and Casablanca – but the project will quickly move on to smaller villages and towns. With 15,000 mosques dotted around the north African country, the idea’s growth potential is clear. The objective was to kickstart a renovations industry for sustainable companies that could employ many Moroccans in the clean energy sector, Kuntze said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/16/europes-renewable-energy-revolution-weatherwatch","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-16T21:30:01Z","webTitle":"Europe's renewable energy revolution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/16/europes-renewable-energy-revolution-weatherwatch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/16/europes-renewable-energy-revolution-weatherwatch","fields":{"headline":"Europe's renewable energy revolution","bodyText":"More than 2km down a dark tunnel deep inside a Norwegian mountain, a drilling machine is boring out holes in the rock. It’s part of a major project that will connect Britain to Norway’s huge hydroelectric power supplies, passing power lines through the mountain near Kvilldal, southwest Norway, before laying the world’s longest undersea power cable, 450km long, to Blyth in Northumberland. It will take years to build, but when it is completed, the UK could import 1,400 megawatts of electricity, enough to power more than 750,000 homes. It will also allow Britain to export any surplus wind energy back to Norway. This is just part of a quiet revolution in renewable energy across Europe. An international power grid is gradually developing, using power interconnectors to trade surplus energy across national electricity networks, allowing big wind power producers in northern Europe, for example, to trade electricity with large solar energy generators in southern Europe. The UK has already plugged into the network through interconnectors to Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and France, and there is a proposal for a highly ambitious project to connect Britain to Iceland’s abundant supply of geothermal and hydroelectric power using a subsea cable around 1,000km long. This international power grid gives more reliable supplies, helping to smooth out the intermittent power produced from renewables such as wind and solar energy. It also gives Britain more secure power sources as old nuclear and out-of-favour coal plants are shut down. In theory, it could even bring the wholesale energy price down, thanks to the increased availability of cheap renewable power generated far away from where the main energy demand centres are."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/dec/18/solar-energy-australia-is-not-an-innovation-nation-its-an-inertia-nation","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-17T23:33:10Z","webTitle":"Solar energy: Australia is not an innovation nation, it's an inertia nation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/18/solar-energy-australia-is-not-an-innovation-nation-its-an-inertia-nation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/18/solar-energy-australia-is-not-an-innovation-nation-its-an-inertia-nation","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy: Australia is not an innovation nation, it's an inertia nation","bodyText":"Australia stands at a crossroads after the Paris agreement and a week of talk about being an innovation nation. This has been coming for some time and, as a successful energy entrepreneur, I think the choices facing the country could not be starker. A mate and I left Australia in 2007 to build a solar business in the United States called Sungevity, which is now selling solar systems to homes and businesses across America and Europe and holds a market value greater than that of Peabody Coal. As our business has continually strengthened, we’ve watched Australia’s solar industry lurch up and down, struggling under the curse of intermittent policy and a lack of commitment. It has affected investment (the policy seesaw was behind our decision to sell our interests in Australia to Roofjuice) and cost Australia its place as a world leader in renewable ingenuity. By comparison California, with its ambition to lead the solar game and its robust innovation culture, has thrived. We started up a business incubator, which now houses dozens of renewable energy companies. I also have the good fortune to run the California clean energy fund, which has invested in startups and entrepreneurs driving climate solutions, creating wealth and jobs and changing the world. In the US they may not like to say the dirty words “industry policy” in public, but in California they’ve still got one and it’s delivering major benefits in the new energy economy. Coming from an epicentre of the enormous changes that are disrupting energy industries globally, I have a few observations of the Australian industry following a recent trip home: Firstly, hats off to the Australian solar industry which, despite it all, pioneers the best technology in the world. At a residential level, it’s achieved some of the highest rates of solar penetration and lowest costs in the world. Thanks to those working in the sector, families are saving money on their power bills and we have great learnings for the rest of the world on how to integrate solar at scale into the electricity supply. Secondly, Australia must build on this success. The last government seemed determined to quash it but there are positive signals from the new prime minister that he understands the world is moving this way and we need to invest to keep up. While I have reservations as to whether the recently announced $1.1bn innovation plan can turn around Australia’s risk-averse business culture, at least it’s a start. Political signals are important – now we need some meat on the bone. Finally, now is the time to move quickly if Australia wants to benefit from the world’s energy shift. Australia has to wake up from the illusion that fossil fuels will be its saviour. The UK has just announced that it will be done with coal by 2025, after hundreds of years of being powered by the stuff. California, the eighth largest economy in the world, is weaning itself off coal by 2020 and has laws in place demanding that 50% of its power comes from renewables by 2030. China, in its latest plan, is going to peak its coal use in 2017. The list goes on. Australia confused delegates in Paris by talking up the opportunities of the transition to renewable energy while seeking to protect the dying coal industry. That is not an innovation nation – it’s an inertia nation. Why not spend the $4bn Australia wastes each year on fossil fuel subsidies on bolstering the renewable energy sector? There’s no market sense in skewing the playing field when the world’s committed to get off coal. There is so much talent in this country. Australia keeps punching above its weight in the world, but its brightest and most innovative minds are struggling for support. We need to lean in on our genius. Australians are legends overseas in the photovoltaic industry, for example, which will dominate energy this century. They should also be household names at home, rather than the mining moguls who are risking everything we hold dear in order to keep profiteering. South Australian business Infratech, for example, is selling floating solar systems to California, which should have been much bigger news. Renewable energy is an enormous export opportunity for Australia. More people live on earth today without electricity than were here when Thomas Edison started spreading the stuff. Most of those people live in nations to the north of Australia. Why can’t we sell some of our solutions and systems for spreading solar and smart energy in these markets? There will be decades of work and trillions of dollars to be made in these emerging markets. If you want an ideas boom, you need to create the infrastructure to mine the minds. Why not build a string of incubators up and down the country, tapping into the power of our people and ideas? We could provide spaces in every city and get the legal, mentoring and capital support to entrepreneurs capable of building the companies and solutions needed. We are willing to help build an energy lab in Sydney - who’s with us? At the end of the day, the transition will not be that hard. We have the technology and the momentum is already there. It’s going to be a bit like the transition we went through from using phones and fax machines to being online. There’s a lot of good work to do, but for most of us it simply means that our electricity service and mobility will be better and cheaper. This is a historic opportunity for ideas and entrepreneurs to arise. The world needs to come up with new combinations of existing things: more than innovation, this energy transition requires great ingenuity. So the challenge is about backing people and their creative genius. Australia has been great at that and could be again, but if you aim to go long on ingenuity, you can’t also be long on a commodity.

Proponents of projects that include energy storage have converged on this small outback city perched on the top of the Spencer Gulf – but why here and why now? The now is easily explained. These companies are seeking to be part of the energy infrastructure revolution promised by the South Australian government, which has recognised that more energy storage is essential to complement the intermittent wind farms and solar plants replacing the state’s ageing coal and gas plants. The proposals are a diverse grab bag of technologies that include battery storage setups either standalone or built into solar PV or gas-fired power plants, a solar thermal tower that uses molten salt to store energy and a pumped hydro project. The transformation underway in the state has even caught the attention of billionaire Tesla co-founder Elon Musk, although the site for his 100MW South Australian battery storage plan – which he promised on Twitter he could roll out within 100 days or it is free – has either not been chosen or publicly announced. The West Australian company Carnegie Clean Energy is another firm planning battery storage for South Australia and Lyon Solar in partnership with American giant AES Energy Storage is also working on such a system. Hugh Saddler, honorary associate professor at the ANU Centre for Climate Economics and Policy, says there are plenty of reasons why so many projects are located at Port Augusta – and why Tesla ought to consider the place. “What Port Augusta has got is a great big node on the national energy market – four high-voltage transmission lines converging on the town,” he says. “It also has a skilled workforce of electrical technicians from the recently closed coal plant, not to mention cheap land.” Spencer Gulf pumped hydro project – EnergyAustralia Long before Tesla’s battery storage systems were a twinkle in Musk’s eye, pumped hydro has been acting as a store for energy. The process involves pumping water from one reservoir at the base of a hill to another at the top and releasing that water back below to generate power. It is complementary to other renewables in that wind and solar farms can provide the power to pump the water uphill when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining and, when they aren’t generating electricity, the water can be released to make up for the shortfall. EnergyAustralia’s spokesman, Brendan Hennessy, says the company and partners Melbourne Energy Institute and Arup Group have engaged in a feasibility study on the prospect of a pumped hydroelectric project but using seawater instead of the freshwater that has been put to such purposes for decades. “The proposed site on the northern end of the Spencer Gulf has 300m of elevation and is within 2km of the coast, close to high-voltage transmission lines,” he says. The company claims the project would be able to produce around 100 megawatts (MW) of electricity with six-to-eight hours of storage, the biggest such project in the world. EnergyAustralia estimates construction would take roughly two years and that it could provide power by the end of 2020. Big battery project – Zen Energy Ever since Musk’s tweets caught the attention of Australia’s most senior politicians, the South Australian company Zen Energy has been jumping up and and down pointing out that it is already set up and ready to roll out battery storage. Its Big Battery Project is exactly what it says it is but Zen Energy is yet to decide exactly how big. The company is examining the possibility of a 100MW version and a 150MW option. The company has a number of solar projects in the Upper Spencer Gulf region and believes a battery storage project would help to stabilise its solar assets and the broader South Australian grid. The company has also formed a partnership with the South Australian gas giant Santos to roll out battery storage systems at gas processing sites. Zen Energy’s chairman, Ross Garnaut, grumbled to the Guardian that “in this Trump era, we have a world where nothing is real until an American billionaire tweets about it”. Solar thermal project – SolarReserve American company Solar Reserve is seeking to capitalise on Port Augusta’s average of 300 days of sunshine a year by rolling out 10,000 mirrors reflecting the sun on to an enormous central tower standing in the middle. The energy generated by the $650m project would be stored in molten salt, meaning the tower could continue providing electricity at night or even on a rainy day – not that Port Augusta has many of those. Solar Reserve has a track record in solar thermal, already operating the 110MW Crescent Dunes project in Nevada and recently announcing a 450MW tower for Chile. The technology has been proven to work around Port Augusta already – a similar solar tower was built for the town’s Sundrop Farms project – a 150m tall tower surrounded by mirrors, used for heating and cooling a greenhouse that produces 15,000 tonnes of tomatoes a year. Solastor Australia has also proposed a $1.2bn solar thermal tower for the town. Bungala solar PV and storage project – Reach Solar Energy Located 7km north-east of Port Augusta on a former ostrich farm, Reach Solar Energy is proposing a $660m solar array with an energy storage system built into the development. The staged construction of the project, which would be of the more common solar PV plant variety rather than solar thermal, would begin with a 100MW single-axis tracking array with plans to add a further 200MW of capacity. The project is the brainchild of former executives from the coal sector who recognised that the closure of Port Augusta’s northern coal-fired power plant in 2016 meant there was a workforce of skilled electrical technicians and spare capacity on the transmission infrastructure just waiting to be put to use. If it goes ahead, the project is expected to supply enough electricity to power over 120,000 homes but the capacity of the planned storage component has not been revealed."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/green-power-and-water-recycling-be-switched-on-by-switching-off","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T21:20:40Z","webTitle":"Green power and water recycling: be switched on by switching off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/green-power-and-water-recycling-be-switched-on-by-switching-off","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/green-power-and-water-recycling-be-switched-on-by-switching-off","fields":{"headline":"Green power and water recycling: be switched on by switching off","bodyText":"Despite living on Earth’s driest populated continent, Australians throw around water as though the supply were endless. We are the planet’s greatest per capita consumers of water, with each person using an average 100,000 litres a year. Much of that is invisible to consumers, expended on the food and products we buy. Our electricity use isn’t much better. A recent Environmental Justice Australia investigation found east coast coal-fired power stations – where emissions limits trail places such as China – are responsible for deadly pollution that causes a suspected 130 premature deaths a year in Sydney alone. Yet oil and coal remain our primary energy sources, powering 70% of the nation. A wiser approach is slowly becoming apparent, but confusion often reigns. So here are some practical steps on how to switch to more sustainable water and electricity consumption. Use less water at home and recycle where possible Many water-saving tips are common sense: turn the tap off while brushing teeth, fix leaky taps immediately, use a dual flush toilet, only run full loads in washing machines and dishwashers, and get a rainwater tank if possible. (Visit the Nature Conservancy Australia for a more in-depth tips list.) Choosing water-efficient appliances is important, too. The national water efficiency star-rating scheme makes pinpointing winners easier. Some rebates apply for water-saving products; check the environment department’s website to search your area. But inventive Australians are also dreaming up recycling solutions. In Adelaide, Peter Cullin created The Cullector, an easy-to-install shower head that captures water wasted during warm-up time, then reuses it to increase shower pressure, saving an average 35,000 litres of water each person each year. Brisbane’s Chris Murray has something similar with his Redwater diverter, and Mackay’s Eric Winn went a step further. His Winns Water Saver diverts cold water from every hot water tap, which is reused in toilets or the garden instead of being flushed down the drain. Avoid wasting water in the garden by mulching and choosing water-wise plants. Some councils offer native plants free to ratepayers. To more efficiently water trees, consider deep root watering using the Greenwell Water Saver, made from recycled plastic by Adelaide’s Brian Measday. Consider your overall water footprint – and try to reduce it Surprisingly, about 90% of personal water consumption is invisible. Beyond the water we directly use in our everyday lives, almost every item consumed and used by humans requires water to make. (Watch this UNESCO short animation for an explanation.) Food is the worst “virtual water” consumption offender. The agriculture industry is responsible for using two-thirds of all water consumed nationally, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Livestock farmed for meat tends to have a far higher water footprint than vegetable and grain crops, largely because of the feed and water animals consume. That doesn’t mean everyone should turn vegetarian overnight. But moderating meat intake and supplementing with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables – preferably organically grown produce, as better quality soil may retain more water – can help. Dutch non-profit network The Water Footprint illustrates the impact well: producing just one kilo of sheep meat requires an average 10,400 litres of water, while one tomato uses only about 50 litres. The bad news? With no real classification system, measuring and decreasing our personal water footprint is difficult. “The simplest way is to consume less. By purchasing less, we immediately reduce our water footprint,” says University of Melbourne associate professor Dr Robert Crawford, who researches household virtual water usage. “This involves purchasing only what we really need, making products last as long as possible, and recycling, reusing and sharing products.” Power your home with more sustainable energy Coal-fired power plants are a significant contributor to Australia’s greenhouse gas pollution, but alternatives that rely less heavily on fossil fuels are growing. The boom in rooftop solar continues, with a record 135,370 systems installed in 2016, according to Melbourne’s Clean Energy Council. While high feed-in tariffs are now rare, solar can still quickly pay for itself if homeowners calculate daytime electricity use and match panel sizes to that consumption pattern. Choice’s consumer guide is a good starting point, with simple explanations of capacity, costs, solar energy storage and available incentives. “Install five to 10 kilowatts of PV solar panel on your rooftop. You will save money while doing a good thing,” says Andrew Blakers, director of Australian National University Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems. “Australia is installing PV and wind fast enough to exceed 50% electricity by 2030. Electrification of nearly all energy functions will follow, and we can reduce emissions by 75% during the 2030s.” If a hefty upfront investment on solar isn’t an option, embrace GreenPower, a national accreditation program for renewable energy sourced from hydro, wind, solar and waste. Switching is as easy as calling your existing power retailer and choosing the percentage of renewable energy you’d like to buy each bill. Retailers then purchase green power on your behalf, feeding it into the national electricity grid. While end users still receive a mix of fossil and renewable energy, supporting GreenPower drives investment in renewables – a major way individuals can help Australia transition to more sustainable power sources. Other similar options include EnergyAustralia’s carbon neutral electricity plan. Lower your own energy use to save money and the environment The downside to green power can be increased costs, as coal-fired power stations remain the cheapest energy source. That’s where offsetting in your home comes in. Simple things can make a huge difference, such as switching appliances off at the wall, using energy-saving light bulbs, drying clothes outside and using timers and sensors for outdoor lights. (See EnergyAustralia’s blog for a more exhaustive list.) Emerging technology may soon make lowering energy use even easier. The Tesla Powerwall home battery stores solar electricity generated during the day for night use – the first Australian to install one in 2016 immediately cut his power bill by 90%. University of Newcastle professor Paul Dastoor has spent two decades developing a water-based solar paint, which allows printable solar panels that could one day turn our cars and even appliances into solar power stations. And Icelandic company Janulus has launched the world’s first portable wind turbine. Clean water and ample electricity are an essential part of modern life; clever and moderated use will ensure that continues at a rate our planet can sustain.

Landrace crop varieties (sometimes known as folk crops) are ancient versions of the standardised crops we rely on today. Genetically variable, these biodiverse cultivars are allowed to grow at will and to cross pollinate. Farmers collect the seeds from successful crops and these become the parents of next year’s varieties. Simple. If this sounds primitive (it is in fact Neolithic), it makes much more sense than modern agriculture, which is reliant on selective breeds that are addicted to fertilisers. The idea is that the selective breeds give the highest yield when conditions are good. This is a terrible strategy in an era of climate change when conditions are not ideal. Modern agriculture has wiped out almost all original genetic diversity. Ancient cultivars of wheat are used for straw or shoved into seed banks. Proponents of the Real Green Movement want them released into the soil. In the UK it would be tough to live on odd, old grains alone – we lack diversity. In fact the Plant Variations and Seeds Act of 1964 makes it legally pretty hard to grow anything but standardised crops. But pioneers are pushing forward. These include gin makers, the Oxford Artisan Distillery (surprisingly Oxford’s first licensed distillery) committed to total provenance and sourcing all ingredients from a 50-mile radius. Their grain, an ancient rye, is from a farm in Thame, grown especially for them. This is a hyper-local product which makes an active contribution to biodiversity – world’s away from the industrial alcohol bought in by most distillers. From mother’s ruin to saviour of the planet. The big picture: mangrove forest communities We are hooked on dramatic events. So the steady cascading effect of climate change on lives and ecosystems gets little attention. But photographer Arati Kumar-Rao’s work somehow explains unfamiliar landscapes such as the Sundarbans (extensive mangrove forests) in Bangladesh, and how communities are driven to the brink of existence by the effects of anthropogenic climate change (aratikumarrao.com).

The scenario is increasingly common as renewables projects spread across the sunshine state, in some cases swallowing large parcels of productive agricultural land. Clean energy offers billions in potential investment and thousands of jobs for regional Queensland. But it also faces on-the-ground challenges, including turf wars with intensive farming that threaten to hamper the energy sector’s transition. Ash’s decision to offer up part of his Mirani property for solar has made him something of a divisive figure locally. Two fellow growers objected, as did the company that buys and refines his cane, Mackay Sugar. Mackay regional council, whose planning officers had backed the project, voted to reject the application. Legal action is afoot. Whenever he’s asked about the state of the sugar industry or the challenges faced by cane growers, Ash just makes a downward motion with his arm. He wanders around his block, pointing to patches of standover cane – left unharvested from the previous season – where solar panels will ultimately be placed. He says part of the field to be given to the solar company was planted with cane just four years ago. “If I had my time over again I wouldn’t have planted it, the way the industry has gone,” Ash says. “When [the solar plan] come around, the way the industry was going, it was going backwards and it was one way of diversifying into something that’s friendly, it’s not going to do harm. “And if it doesn’t work, well, they’ll reinstate the ground back to how it was. You’re not putting it under cement or doing that sort of thing.” ‘It’s a very sunny place’ Modelling released by the Climate Institute last year showed Queensland had the potential to power 4m homes through renewable energy projects and create more than 7,000 jobs over the next decade, many of them in north and central Queensland where many local economies are struggling with high unemployment and the hit-and-miss legacies of mining and gas booms. The number of jobs on offer is considerably more than at Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, a project touted by many in these parts as an economic saviour. Andrew Stock, an energy expert and councillor for the Climate Council, says about $1.6bn of renewable investment is being built in Queensland. “Obviously ... it’s a very sunny place so solar projects both large and small, are very well suited to Queensland and north Queensland,” he says. “The amount of energy they can generate ... is among the highest output of any solar farms in Australia.” The clean energy regulator says the government’s 2020 renewable energy target has effectively been met by projects either built or under construction. Incentives have led to an industry boom but there is a danger it will shift to bust without changes to policy settings and planning regulations that could threaten the pace of the renewable transition. Stock says the federal government’s national energy guarantee is “woefully inadequate” and will bring forward no new renewable energy capacity over the next decade. “If electricity demand doesn’t grow, and no existing coal plants shut, the modelling by the energy security board last year shows there are virtually no new renewables ... that need to be built,” he says. “And that’s potentially a problem for renewables, that pipeline of investment projects, probably between $7bn to $10bn worth of investment, many thousands of jobs ... and that’s all put at risk because under the Neg, the emissions reduction requirements mean that there’s virtually no new renewable capacity that’s needed.” From overhead, the cane fields are a mesmerising combination of bright green and right angles, stretching for country miles. About 300km to the north of Mirani, near the banks of the Burdekin River, patterned rows of black panels suddenly consume the landscape. The Clare solar farm is the state’s largest, and last month was connected to the energy grid. In 2015 it caused angst among cane growers and was subject to a legal challenge led by the local milling company, Wilmar, until being “called in” by the state government, a process that overrides local planners on matters of state significance. The same conflict between sugar and solar has been repeated at Mirani, and will be again. “The Queensland government has a very strong policy of supporting solar renewables in general,” says Georgina Davis, senior policy adviser for the Queensland Farmers’ Federation. “They didn’t make provision to plan where they would go. They’ve let that be a market-driven process. “It’s just been an unfortunate sort of effect that some of those sites have been on [good quality] agricultural land. Their primary focus is looking for a piece of land that has a willing seller or a willing renter, and that has the access to infrastructure they need.” Solar projects are more efficient, and more profitable, the closer they are built to existing substations, which means proponents have targeted certain blocks. The Australian Energy Market Operator issues ratings called “marginal loss factors” which score renewable projects based on local demand and effectively determine how much energy that project can feed into the grid. “The adoption and interest in large-scale solar has been so quick, and it has had to be quick,” Davis says. “A lot of them have been in a rush to get these facilities up compared to their competitors ... Once that capacity is gone, it’s gone.” Although the operation of the energy market has exacerbated land-use conflicts, planning policies also lack consistency when it comes to land disputes between agriculture and renewables. The Queensland state planning policy lists enabling renewable energy projects as a priority. It also aims to minimise “encroachment on agricultural resources to ensure viable tracts of agricultural land are maintained”. The farmers’ federation and the farm lobby group AgForce have called for a solar code that provides protection for high-quality land and establishes rehabilitation bonds, similar to those for mining tenements. Graziers are worried about the effect of power lines connecting some facilities, and farmers are in some cases uncomfortable that they are close to projects. ‘The industry has got a lot to prove yet’ The Mackay mayor, Greg Williamson, says his council would have supported a solar farm proposal had it been on “rubbish land” but state policies required it to consider the agricultural impacts. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s the one that’s being contested now or not,” he says. “If it’s growing 9,000 to 10,000 tonne of cane a year and it [is good quality agricultural land], we’re obliged to consider that. And really nothing else trumps it.” Even if state government policy did not mandate the consideration of agricultural land, the council’s priority is sugar, rather than solar, Williamson says. The council has “nothing against solar” and considered building its own solar farm, but found ultimately it would not produce savings to justify the investment. Instead, the region is putting panels at individual council sites. “We don’t want a future for our industry to be less cane farms and to grow solar panels,” he says. “We want more sugar to be produced. We want to grow more sugar for the right outcomes.” Stock says communities such as Mackay, which is a hub for the Bowen basin’s coalmines, should be among the first to embrace the opportunities provided by renewables. They should “start to plan that transition in an orderly way so they don’t end up being faced with really quite dramatic shocks to regional employment when mines close”. Williamson, who argues that Australia should have invested in new coal-fired power stations, bristles at that suggestion. “Well, mate, hang on,” he says. “Queensland generates 14.8 gigawatts of power to run every day and less than 5% has been generated by solar. The industry has got a lot to prove yet. “From a council perspective, we have an industry [sugar] that produces $400m to $500m a year for our valley, for our region ... It is not fair to level at council a head-in-the-sand attitude about renewable energy ... when we have a vested interest in protecting an industry that provides millions and millions of dollars to this district.” For Colin Ash, that same industry, the one he’s worked in for a lifetime, is getting to the point where he’s struggling to make ends meet. Like many other growers he has everything – his income, and his ability to fund his retirement – invested in the land. “It’s not a goldmine what they’re offering [for the solar development],” he says. “When this come along, that was one way of putting a bit of a buffer in there, without the cost of diversifying into something else. “It was clean, green, and no trouble to go back to any other agriculture afterwards if it doesn’t work. “You just can’t get sentimental about these things.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/feb/26/tinos-cyclades-greece-island-food-wine","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T06:30:05Z","webTitle":"A taste of Greece: the new culinary scene on Tinos island","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/feb/26/tinos-cyclades-greece-island-food-wine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/feb/26/tinos-cyclades-greece-island-food-wine","fields":{"headline":"A taste of Greece: the new culinary scene on Tinos island","bodyText":"It’s pretty obvious why the 20th-century Greek philosopher Cornelius Castoriadis called Tinos the “handmade island”. In the 50-odd villages of this 75 square-mile isle in the northern Cyclades, marble sculptors have transformed every lintel, doorway, and fountain into a work of art. Even the For Sale signs on empty houses are carved from marble. The dry stone walls that corrugate the valleys, the intricate dovecotes and the gaping quarries sprinkled around these sage-scented hills are evidence of hard labour, as well as an artistic sensibility. In 1842, French travel writer Alexis de Valon noted: “The whole island is cultivated with great determination, almost in defiance of nature; in the absence of soil, the inhabitants even plough the rocks.” At his Volacus winery in Falatados, in the south-east of Tinos, Michalis Kontizas is continuing this tradition: his organic vineyards snuggle among granite boulders as smooth as giant cannonballs. There’s nothing for miles around but wide-open spaces and fearless goats – one so bold it climbs into our car as we pull up at the winery, a huddle of former shepherd’s huts that Kontizas has restored stone by stone. This windswept landscape is Greece’s new wine frontier. Tinos was a major wine producer for centuries, but when farmers switched to livestock in the 1970s, the vines were ravaged by grazing goats. “The sandy soil protected this terroir from phylloxera,” says Kontizas, a trim, soft-spoken man with a steady gaze. “But organic wine is a gamble: you’re at the mercy of the weather.” After six years of hard graft, he produced his first malagouzia wine in 2016, a small yield of about 2,500 bottles. “Greece needs tourism, as we don’t produce much. But we want those who come to try the things we do produce,” says Kontizas, pouring two glasses of white malagouzia that tastes, intensely, of summer in the Cyclades. On a slab of granite, he lays out slices of pale pink louza (air-dried pork cured in red wine). “I have something special for you try,” he smiles, prising open what looks like a gnarled gourd with a penknife. Inside is a crumbly kariki blue cheese, matured for six months in a pumpkin shell. Made from raw cow’s milk, kariki tastes like a mellow roquefort with the texture of parmesan. Not far from here, Jerome Binda, originally from Paris, has established Domaine de Kalathas, where he experiments with natural wines – with phenomenal results. The organic estate is off-grid, relying on solar energy and local wells for water. A spectacular stone house overlooking the vineyards, decorated with aplomb by Binda’s wife, Sabrina, a ceramic artist who runs workshops in her hilltop atelier, is available to rent. (Her delicate ceramics are available from Trela Tinos, a design and antique shop in Tinos Town.) Over rabbit stifado, tomato fritters, and pickled artichokes at Tereza’s grocery-cum-taverna in the nearby village of Myrsini, Binda tells me how he left a career as a graphic designer and antiques dealer to settle on Tinos: “I was always a wine lover, but never dared to imagine being a winemaker. I thought it was reserved for people who inherited a vineyard, with their own techniques and clientele. On Tinos, I could create my own heritage with 150-year-old, ungrafted vines that had been left to their own devices for decades.” Tereza pokes her head round the door. “Even if I burn the food, I just had to tell you this is the most delicious wine I’ve ever tasted,” she beams, raising a glass of Binda’s beautifully balanced rosé. Like with many family-run tavernas in rural Tinos, pretty much everything on the menu, including the rough-and-ready wine, has been grown, reared, foraged or made by Tereza and her husband Joseph. But there are plenty of restaurants that serve Domaine de Kalathas and Volacus wines. They include San to Alati, Marathia and Itan Ena Mikro Karavi, all in or near Tinos Town, and all using Greek ingredients in inspired new ways. These and other local food businesses have banded together to create Tinos Food Paths, an annual spring celebration of the island’s culinary heritage. “It’s not just cooks and critics, the whole island gets involved,” says chef Andonis Psaltis. “We have barbecues on the beach, cocktail masterclasses in monasteries, and feasts in village squares with lutes and violins.” All kinds of businesses have embraced the island’s culinary revival. Eleni Toli (yogaintinos.com), originally from Athens, abandoned a corporate career to set up a yoga shala in an island house built in 1797, and offers hand-picked herbal teas after class. Beekeeper Nikos Karagiorgis sells exquisite heather honey at his shop (tospititoumeliou.com.gr) in Pyrgos, in the north of the island, alongside a raki, made by his son Dimitris, that he claims is so pure it’s hangover-proof. At Crossroads Inn (studios from €96), in Tripotamos village in the middle of the island, even the chamomile and lavender soaps are handmade locally. Many of Tripotamos’ 40 inhabitants provide ingredients for the Cycladic breakfast – a feast of eggs, preserves, pickles, pies, goat’s cheese and fennel salami. In a tiny hamlet a few kilometres away, guests at Xinara House (xinarahouse.com) will be able to pick persimmons, peaches and figs for breakfast, to go with eggs, milk and yoghurt from local farmers. British couple Peter and Sue Marston, an architect and an artist, are restoring this 18th-century bishop’s residence and smithy with the help of the island’s brilliant marble craftsmen. The estate has its own vineyard and a plunge pool surrounded by colossal boulders and fed by a mountain spring. Village cooks will prepare traditional meals in the kitchen, which is filled with the Marstons’ magpie collection of art and antiques. But the very essence of Tinos is best tasted at Thalassaki, on the jetty at Ormos Ysternia in the north-west (+30 2283 031366, no website). Antonia Zarpa’s phenomenal food – squid ink tarama, goat’s cheese with bee pollen, and octopus with chickpeas, roast onions and lemon jam – has such a cult following that speedboats regularly zip over from busy Mykonos, to the south. Murmurs of delight punctuate the still evening, until a giant wave appears from nowhere, washing away mussels, flip flops, a mobile phone. “This never happens,” the waiter shrugs. The next day, as I’m sampling Tinian cheeses at rival taverna Naftilos, another wave lurches over my table. Tinos may be Greece’s new epicurean destination, but it is still, deliciously, at the mercy of the elements. Way to go For further information on Greece, visit discovergreece.com. How to get there Tinos is 3 hours and 40 minutes by ferry from the port of Rafina, a 30-minute drive from Athens airport. A single crossing for a car and two people starts at €21.50 with Golden Star Ferries. Where to stay Studios at Crossroads Inn cost from €95 for two, breakfast €15pp. The Bindas’ holiday houses, Bergerie Tinos, cost from €100. Xinara House opens in June, prices to be announced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2018/sep/01/whats-happening-weather-answers-arctic-air-oden-helen-czerski","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-01T13:00:55Z","webTitle":"What’s happening to our weather?

The answers are hiding in Arctic air","bodyText":"I am standing on the ocean. Ahead of me, the world is split into two perfect halves: blue sky above, white sea ice below. The view is clean and simple, but a continuous waltz of swirling and shunting is hidden inside those two colours: the inner workings of the Arctic engine. This place is special for many reasons, and to appreciate one of the most unusual all I need to do is to live; to breathe. The air is -2C, but the air coming from my lungs is invisible. The familiar wisps of cold breath that I associate with crisp winter air in Britain are absent. They cannot form here. And that anomaly is connected in a fundamental way to our presence here, on a scientific expedition to study this environment. For two months, the Swedish icebreaker Oden is home to 74 of us, living and working at the top of the world to tap into the stories that the blue and the white have to tell. The Arctic has held on to its mystique for centuries. Many western explorers have pitted their wits, strength, and endurance against this environment, while traditional Arctic communities have learned to work with the complexities of the ice rather than against them. Those of us who live well south of the Arctic circle hear a lot about how the white in the north is changing, but less about how it is. It’s hard to construct a secondhand mental image of what it’s like here. There are no landmarks and you cannot step in the footprints of the past. This is an ocean with an icy shell that cracks and shifts as it’s pushed by the wind, breaking apart into separate floes or piling up to form ridges. Each floe is mostly flat on top, and right now they’re dotted with curvy, light-blue melt ponds as weak summer sunlight trickles into the ice for 24 hours every day. Dark ocean fills the gaps created as floes move apart, but in some places there is no open water for miles. Above the ice, clouds and fog are the norm, and often the entire world is painted only in shades of white. It is quiet. Oden is an experienced voyager in these waters. It was the first non-nuclear ship ever to reach the north pole (in 1991), capable of breaking through a continuous ice layer that is two metres thick. Just the existence of this ship is testimony to human determination to explore challenging environments. But on this trip, the desire to go one step further is merged with self-preservation. The Arctic may be a long way from most of us, but what happens here matters to all of us. The weather up here is intimately connected to the patterns of weather further south, particularly the jet stream that feeds endless British conversations about the weather. As the sea ice melts, shipping routes are opening up across the Arctic, bringing questions about regulation and control over this previously inaccessible region. And this is an important area for many species, providing summer feeding grounds for visitors from the south. The Arctic may be a long way away, but it is woven into all our lives. This scientific expedition was funded by the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat and the American National Science Foundation to answer a specific question: how does the ocean affect the weather in the high Arctic? It’s thought that material produced by life beneath the ice reaches and influences the clouds, but how does that happen and when? Answers to those questions are essential to improve the weather forecasts for this region, and to allow us to predict the effects of the substantial changes in temperature and sea ice that have been observed. Sea ice doesn’t just matter for its own sake. It has a strong influence on both the ocean and atmosphere, and the consequences tweak our planet’s energy budget. The solar energy that flows into the Earth system is mostly absorbed in the tropics, transported northwards by the atmosphere and ocean, and eventually re-emitted into space as infra-red radiation. The Arctic balance sheet controls the final part of that process, and the keys to the energy flow through this vast icy wilderness are held by the clouds. Oden is a tiny speck in the white, drifting with the sea ice only a few miles from the north pole, perfectly positioned between the clouds and the ocean to watch and sample and learn. The reason I can walk outside on a perfectly clear and very cold day and still not see my breath is that the air here is astonishingly clean. Air carries tiny particles, known as aerosols, which form from gases in the atmosphere, or come from vegetation, dust and sea spray. Human-generated pollution adds more, and the air most of us breathe has tens or hundreds of thousands of aerosol particles in every cubic centimetre. On a crisp morning in Britain, the water vapour I breathe out quickly condenses on to those particles, making tiny liquid droplets that I can see. Here at the north pole, there are fewer aerosol particles than almost anywhere on Earth – fewer than 10 per cubic centimetre. The atmospheric scientists on board are fantastically excited about sampling such rare conditions and such clean air. Very few measurements have ever been made in these conditions, and the meteorological data from this expedition is especially valuable. Every cloud droplet needs one of these aerosol particles to get started, and it can be one of two types. There are cloud condensation nuclei, on which water condenses to form liquid droplets, and ice nuclei, which have the perfect surface for ice crystal formation. This is the link to Arctic biology, because tiny organisms in the ocean spit out material with just the right characteristics to do those jobs. That could be very important, if those molecules are regularly ejected upwards from the ocean. But the ice cover acts as a lid, and the low wind speeds leave the small patches of open water unruffled. There is a mystery here to solve – the air here is so clean because there are very few sources of aerosol, especially the types needed to form clouds. But almost every day is overcast, so there must be enough coming from somewhere. Following the chain of logic back from the clouds themselves, you end up asking what generates the minuscule number of aerosols up here, and how they get to a position where they can influence cloud formation. Then you have to piece together the whole puzzle – how air movement, air chemistry, light, heat, aerosols, biology and the ice itself are connected together to control the vast energy flows through this region, which then tug on global weather patterns. It’s a complex problem, and so the scientists on board have a variety of specialisms. I’m living with and learning from ice physicists, chemists, atmospheric scientists, biologists and oceanographers. When questions come up over breakfast, the person with the answer or the necessary equipment may well be at the next table. And everything is easy when you ask the right person. A few days ago, I had a problem with slush forming in a hole drilled through the ice, making me worry it would freeze up. One researcher on board took me to his workshop, and made my day by producing a collection of shiny steel kitchen sieves, strainers and scoops that any posh restaurant would be proud of, brought specifically to scoop icy slush out of holes. The practical challenges loom large in all our lives, and they can’t all be solved with a sieve. We are moored next to a large ice floe around 2km in diameter, drifting with it as it meanders close to the north pole. It is nearly two metres thick almost everywhere, and unusually flat on both the top and the bottom. It’s likely that the floe is around three years old, and originated in Siberia. It provides a surprisingly stable platform to work on, and it’s now home to a 15-metre meteorological mast, two large tethered balloons for lifting sensors into the clouds, a large hole covered by a tent which is the base for a robot submarine, and a small harbour on the far side for launching experiments that float. We walk out to our work sites after breakfast and return for dinner. It’s the closest to a nine-to-five job I’ve ever had. But the temperature is always zero or below, ice is fickle, and everyone working on it must be accompanied by a guard watching out for polar bears. My own tiny piece of this picture is out at the harbour, or “open lead”, a place where there’s a watery gap between floes. One of the proposed routes for biological material to get into the clouds is for bubbles in the water to burst and spit minuscule droplets upwards. Bubbles have been seen in these open leads, but we don’t know how they form or how important bubble bursting is for transporting biological material from the ocean into the atmosphere. I’ve got an ocean bubble camera that peers into the water just below the surface, my electronic eye in the watery world below. I’ve also got a collection of other sensors to follow water flow velocities, dissolved gas, temperature and salinity. My colleague Matt Salter has a floating chamber that sits next to the camera like an umbrella over the water surface, collecting particles from below instead of deflecting rain drops from above. Between us, we can monitor both the bubbles and the particles they spit upwards, so we hope to quantify their importance, filling in one tiny gap in humanity’s knowledge of the Arctic. The experiments are delicate, but deploying them is often satisfyingly physical. We’re towing, mooring, dragging, digging, and tying more knots in a day than I would at home in a year. We work in large flotation suits, which mostly keep us warm and dry, but are also very good at sealing in the sweat produced by physical exertion. A small white hut provides some shelter during our lunch stop, when we unpack and share cold pizza and hot Swedish “blueberry soup” sent out with us in the morning by Oden’s kitchen staff. This is teamwork, our small team at the open lead within the larger team of the ship, which sits within the team of the wider scientific community. Understanding this environment is slow work, but the need is urgent. This region is already changing very rapidly, and we cannot understand the importance of a change if we don’t understand the starting point. Expeditions like this are difficult and expensive to run, but the data they produce is essential. In the next couple of weeks, there will be plenty of news stories about the annual sea ice minimum, but less discussion about the specifics of why it might matter. If the ice changes, many other things will also change, and we need to predict the consequences. As I stand on the ice on this rare clear day, breathing the cleanest air of my life, I wonder what this might be like in 10 or 20 or 50 years’ time. A newly accessible ocean comes with a lot of complications – ships and people and pollution and territorial claims – and maybe air this clean won’t exist on Earth for much longer. Will that matter? We don’t know, though answers from this expedition may help us find out. But for now, a human can still stand on the ocean at the top of the world, breathe in the freezing air of summertime and breathe out, invisibly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/09/giant-solar-power-plant-uk-biggest-north-kent-coast-subsidy-free-power-station-faversham","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T15:55:03Z","webTitle":"UK's biggest solar farm planned for Kent coast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/09/giant-solar-power-plant-uk-biggest-north-kent-coast-subsidy-free-power-station-faversham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/09/giant-solar-power-plant-uk-biggest-north-kent-coast-subsidy-free-power-station-faversham","fields":{"headline":"UK's biggest solar farm planned for Kent coast","bodyText":"An enormous solar power station is planned for the north Kent coast that would be the UK’s biggest and dwarf existing solar farms, providing a significant boost to an industry that has stalled since ministers halted subsidies 18 months ago. Cleve Hill, a mile from the historic town of Faversham, would have five times the capacity of the UK’s current largest solar farm and provide enough power for around 110,000 households if it comes online in 2020 as proposed. Developers Hive Energy and Wirsol Energy hope to lay solar panels across 890 acres (365 hectares) – equal to more than 400 football pitches – of farmland near the village of Graveney. The companies think that falling technology costs and the economies of scale from supersizing the solar farm mean it will work without subsidies. Only one big subsidy-free solar farm has been built since support was axed by the government in 2016, near Flitwick in Bedfordshire, but that was an extension to an existing solar farm built using earlier subsidies. Hugh Brennan of Hive Energy said: “The Cleve Hill solar park is a pioneering scheme that aims to optimise the technological developments in solar energy.” A consultation has begun and letters sent out to residents ahead of local meetings in December, with the project’s backers stressing they are aware of the site’s importance for wildlife. The area’s salt marshes and mudflats are used by migrating birds including marsh harriers and lapwing. Readers will also know the marshes as similar to the nearby childhood home of Pip in Charles Dickens’s Great Expectations. One resident said he was in favour of renewable energy but there were concerns locally over the sheer scale of the project. Adrian Oliver, owner of the Freewheel cycling cafe in Graveney, said: “I think people are worried about the scale of it, and the infrastructure [roads] impact as it gets built. “I don’t think anyone is anti the fact that it is a brilliant energy source. I’m broadly for it as long it’s done well and doesn’t disturb the wildlife.” He added that the area had experienced some traffic during the building of a substation for the world’s biggest offshore windfarm, the London Array. The proposed solar farm would connect up to the substation. Cleve Hill’s backers said public rights of way that run across the site would not be affected, and footpaths would not be permanently closed. They also promise to limit any impact on wildlife, with a proposal to establish a mitigation area for birds. The Kent Wildlife Trust said its main concern was about the impact on birds that live on its nature reserve adjacent to the site. Brent geese from the reserve, for example, sometimes rest up on the farmland. “The scale is unprecedented. We have a lot of questions,” said Greg Hitchcock, the conservation officer at the trust. The RSPB said it was examining the plans and that it was too early to comment. One green group welcomed the solar farm but said that its enormous size showed government policy meant that community-backed solar plants were being “frozen out”. Max Wakefield, lead campaigner at climate charity 10:10, said: “It’s a real ray of sunshine to see such ambitious clean energy projects emerging in the UK despite the policy obstacles. But the scale this project has had to adopt in order to be commercially viable is also a warning.” The Solar Trade Association echoed that view. “Government policy of excluding solar from clean power auctions is driving larger projects in a bid to get the economics to work,” said a spokeswoman. Cleve Hill could have a capacity of as much as 350MW, though its backers said the final size had not been decided. The scale means the project will need to gain approval from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. A medium-sized conventional power plant would generate around 1,000MW. Britain’s biggest existing solar farm is at Lyneham in Wiltshire. It produces 69MW and is owned by the government. There are also several around the 50-60MW mark. However, most of the UK’s solar farms are relatively small, and only around 80 can generate more than 20MW. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/10/indian-solar-power-prices-hit-record-low-undercutting-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-10T12:29:29Z","webTitle":"Indian solar power prices hit record low, undercutting fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/10/indian-solar-power-prices-hit-record-low-undercutting-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/10/indian-solar-power-prices-hit-record-low-undercutting-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"Indian solar power prices hit record low, undercutting fossil fuels","bodyText":"Wholesale solar power prices have reached another record low in India, faster than analysts predicted and further undercutting the price of fossil fuel-generated power in the country. The tumbling price of solar energy also increases the likelihood that India will meet – and by its own predictions, exceed – the renewable energy targets it set at the Paris climate accords in December 2015. India is the world’s third-largest carbon polluter, with emissions forecast to at least double as it seeks to develop its economy and lift hundreds of millions of citizens out of poverty. Ensuring it generates as much of that energy as possible from renewable sources is considered crucial to limiting catastrophic global temperature increases. At a reverse auction in Rajasthan on Tuesday, power companies Phelan Energy and Avaada Power each offered to charge 2.62 rupees per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated from solar panels they hope to build at an energy park in the desert state. Last year’s previous record lowest bid was 4.34 rupees per kWh . Analysts called the 40% price drop “world historic” and said it was driven by cheaper finance and growing investor confidence in India’s pledge to dramatically increase its renewable energy capacity. It reduces the market price of solar tariffs well past the average charged by India’s largest thermal coal conglomerate, currently around 3.20 rupees per kWh . Wholesale price bids for wind energy also reached a record low of 3.46 rupees in February. Kanika Chawla, a senior programme lead at the Delhi-based Council for Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), said it was encouraging that Rajasthan project bidders were “new players, not the same old market leaders”. “It shows there is enough happening to attract investment, attract interest from companies who have otherwise been cautious,” she said. Prices were likely to drop further if the cost of borrowing money continued to fall – which she said was one of the major drivers in the record low prices this year. “Any future incremental gains in prices will not come from the decline in technology prices, they will come from declines in the cost of finance,” she said. Investors were also likely encouraged by a recent move to allow the state-backed Solar Energy Corporation of India to act as a guarantor in agreements between energy developers and India’s debt-ridden power distribution companies. Tim Buckley, a director at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the most important factor driving a rush of international investment in Indian renewables was the “transparency, longevity and certainty” of the country’s energy policy. “That is absolutely critical because when you invest for 25 to 35 years, you need certainty and clarity of policy,” he said. “India has prime minister [Narendra] Modi saying this is his number one objective, you have energy minister [Piyush] Goyal talking about it every day. There is no doubt in anyone’s mind about Goyal’s commitment to this program and Modi’s endorsement of what Goyal’s doing,” he said. By 2022, India aims to have the capacity to generate 175 gigawatts of power from solar, biomass and wind energy. A draft report by the country’s electricity agency in December predicted that capacity would increase to 275 gigawatts by 2027. The same draft report said it was unlikely India would need any new coal power stations for at least 10 years, beyond the 50 gigawatts of projects already in the pipeline. Chawla said the successive drops in renewable prices “should be celebrated” but cautioned that systemic reforms were still needed to make the trend sustainable. Renewable energy projects also still enjoyed exemptions from some taxes that fossil fuel-generators had to pay, she added. “We need to run the numbers before we can say [unsubsidised solar] is cheaper than coal, but it’s definitely competitive,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/27/subsidize-coal-nuclear-plants-taxpayer-cost-rick-perry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T10:00:27Z","webTitle":"Subsidy plan for coal and nuclear plants 'will cost US taxpayers $10.6bn a year'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/27/subsidize-coal-nuclear-plants-taxpayer-cost-rick-perry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/27/subsidize-coal-nuclear-plants-taxpayer-cost-rick-perry","fields":{"headline":"Subsidy plan for coal and nuclear plants 'will cost US taxpayers $10.6bn a year'","bodyText":"A Trump administration plan to subsidize coal and nuclear energy would cost US taxpayers about $10.6bn a year and prop up some of the oldest and dirtiest power plants in the country, a new analysis has found. The Department of Energy has proposed that coal and nuclear plants be compensated not only for the electricity they produce but also for the reliability they provide to the grid. The new rule would provide payments to facilities that store fuel on-site for 90 days or more because they are “indispensable for our economic and national security”. Rick Perry, the energy secretary, said the subsidies were needed to avoid power outages “in times of supply stress such as recent natural disasters”. The plan would provide a lifeline to many ageing coal and nuclear plants that would otherwise go out of business, primarily due to the abundance of cheap natural gas and the plummeting cost of renewables. The Department of Energy noted 531 coal-generating units were retired between 2002 and 2016, while eight nuclear reactors have announced retirement plans in the past year. Donald Trump has vowed to arrest this decline and end the “war” on mining communities by repealing various environmental regulations put in place during the Obama administration. Perry’s pro-coal market intervention would cost taxpayers as much as $10.6bn a year over the next decade, according to a joint analysis by the non-partisan groups Climate Policy Initiative and Energy Innovation. Just a handful of companies, operating about 90 plants on the eastern seaboard and the midwest, would benefit from the subsidies, the report found. “The irony of putting costs on consumers for resources that are no longer competitive is really striking,” said Brendan Pierpont, energy finance consultant at Climate Policy Initiative. “It would serve to keep a lot of uneconomic plants in the market that currently can’t compete with the changing dynamics of cheap gas and the falling cost of renewables.” The Trump administration has raised concerns that the growth of intermittent wind and solar energy could undermine the so-called “baseload” power provided by coal and nuclear, pointing to power outages during the Polar Vortex cold wave that swept over North America in 2014. However, recent studies of the grid have found that it has not been weakened by the loss of coal and nuclear plants and is barely affected by power outages. Also, coal-fired plants are not immune to natural disasters, with facilities going offline during the Polar Vortex and Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas this year. An unlikely alliance of renewable energy advocates and the American Petroleum Institute has complained that Perry’s plan tips the scales in favor of a failing coal industry and has vowed to fight the proposal. The rule would also jar with the supposed free market principles of an administration that has attacked subsidies for wind and solar, as well as intervention in healthcare insurance markets. “Perry’s obsession with propping up these expensive, dirty facilities will cost Americans real money,” said Mary Anne Hitt, a campaigner at the Sierra Club. “These ageing coal plants are making Americans sick, and now Secretary Perry wants to force us to pay tens of billions of dollars to Wall Street to keep them running, so they can continue polluting our air and water.” Perry’s plan has to be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is housed within the Department of Energy but is an independent agency. Two of FERC’s three commissioners were appointed by Trump, with one, Neil Chatterjee, already voicing support for subsidizing coal and nuclear. Perry has asked for a ruling on his request by 27 November. The aggressively pro-fossil fuels stance of the Trump administration has been advanced elsewhere this week, with the House of Representatives approving a budget plan that would open the way for oil drilling in a vast Arctic wildlife refuge in Alaska. Meanwhile, the interior department has released a plan to sweep away the regulatory “burdens” that slow down or prevent mining and drilling on public lands.

Home Energy &amp; Lifestyle Management Ltd (Helms), based in Glasgow, has been slapped with a £200,000 fine by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) after pestering householders with millions of automated calls on an “industrial scale”. An ICO investigation found that Helms made over six million calls as part of a massive automated call marketing campaign offering ‘free’ solar panels. It said an organisation should have individuals’ permission – which specifically names the company concerned – in order to make automated calls, yet this was not the case. Helms – an accredited company in the failed Government Green Deal initiative to help people make energy saving improvements to their homes – admitted it didn’t even know what the rules were. In just over two months – from October to December 2014 – the ICO received 242 complaints from individuals. One said they were waiting for news of a terminally ill relative and couldn’t ignore the phone, feeling “powerless” against the barrage of automated calls. The ICO’s head of enforcement, Steve Eckersley, said: “This company’s ignorance of the law is beyond belief. It didn’t even bother to find out what the rules were and its badly thought out marketing campaign made people’s lives a misery. “The monetary penalty is for a significant amount because of the clear failings of the company, and the number of people affected by its deliberate and unlawful campaign. It should be a warning to other companies to think before they launch into a campaign.” The investigation found that the calls were also misleading because the solar panels were not necessarily free as implied by the recorded message. The record sanction is the latest move in a concerted crackdown by the ICO and other agencies on nuisance calls. In the last year, it has received more than 180,000 complaints about nuisance calls, up from 160,000 two years earlier. The ICO was given new powers earlier this year to crack down on nuisance calls, but information commissioner Christopher Graham is now pressing the government to go further. He wants ministers to bring in tougher punishments for individuals who sell lists of phone numbers to cold-calling companies and in doing so breach data protection laws. At the moment the strongest punishment for unlawful disclosure of personal data is a fine from a magistrates’ court Peter Tutton, head of policy at StepChange Debt Charity, said: “For many people nuisance calls can be dismissed as an everyday nuisance, but for others these types of unsolicited marketing calls can cause serious stress and anxiety. Today’s action is to be welcomed and should serve as a warning to firms that this kind of practice cannot continue.” He said the UK still lags behind many other countries in how it deals with this problem and “there are a number of reforms that could help combat this ongoing issue. The Telephone Preference Service’s current ‘opt-out’ [of marketing calls] system is the lowest permitted by the European Union; firms continue to sell high-risk financial products via unsolicited marketing calls and texts; and the resources available to regulators are insufficient compared to the scale of the problem”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/may/14/secrets-shiny-yellow-buttercup-plantwatch","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-14T20:30:25Z","webTitle":"Secrets of the shiny yellow buttercup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/may/14/secrets-shiny-yellow-buttercup-plantwatch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/may/14/secrets-shiny-yellow-buttercup-plantwatch","fields":{"headline":"Secrets of the shiny yellow buttercup","bodyText":"Do you like butter? Hold a buttercup under your chin and folklore says if there is a yellow reflection on your skin it means you do. But the real reason the flowers seem to shine with an intense glittering yellow is nothing to do with butter but about advertising the plants to insect pollinators from a great distance. Buttercups get their bright colour from yellow pigments in the petals’ surface layer, and their shiny gloss is thanks to layers of air just beneath the surface reflecting the light like mirrors. The glowing phenomenon is unique in plants, although something similar happens with some butterfly and bird wings. The buttercup’s sparkling light also needs the sun to be high in the sky, so May is a good time of year for the flowers. And buttercup flowers also track the sun. On cold days, the petals make a cup shape like a satellite dish, collecting solar energy from sunshine and warming up the flowers, which makes them even more inviting to insects, perhaps because it helps them to keep up their own temperature. The cup-shaped flower also focuses the sunlight into its centre where the reproductive organs are warmed up, boosting the ripening of pollen in the stamens and improving the chances of fertilisation in the carpels. And after the flower is pollinated the solar heat might help seed development. The solar tracking is even more useful in the chill air of alpine regions, where the flowers warm up by concentrating the sunshine, sometimes boosting temperatures by more than 3C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/jun/19/sorry-poncey-fashionistas-you-can-wear-what-you-like-at-glastonbury","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-19T13:19:03Z","webTitle":"Sorry, poncey fashionistas – you can wear what you like at Glastonbury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/19/sorry-poncey-fashionistas-you-can-wear-what-you-like-at-glastonbury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/19/sorry-poncey-fashionistas-you-can-wear-what-you-like-at-glastonbury","fields":{"headline":"Sorry, poncey fashionistas – you can wear what you like at Glastonbury","bodyText":"Disappointing news: Glastonbury is to be a showcase for fashion. And I thought music festivals were meant to be a tiny bit rebellious and uninhibited. Aren’t you meant to wear what you like, and make your mother worry about drugs, stinky overflowing lavatories and swirling germs? “That was about 30 years ago,” says Fielding harshly, and he may be right. Now it’s the place for “wardrobe activism” (AKA a slogan T-shirt), athleisure, mastering “the decadent mood” and making sure to “pose and expose”. It all sounds tremendously bossy to me – being told what to wear, and how, especially when you’re meant to be going wild. Apparently, the “catwalk dictates” that yellow is this year’s colour, but ignore it, festival-goers, along with all fashion’s commands. You don’t need to go around looking jaundiced. And you don’t need to “be tactful” with the fringing on your shorts. Reject these prune-faced moralisers. Wear whatever you like. You are not babies. You don’t need instructions on how to dress when in search of freedom. “Pair a sequined tee with a mannish oversized coat or a silky trench to keep warm after hours,” instructs Condé Nast Traveller, as if you are all dopes. Just say no. Refuse uniform, wear last year’s rags if you so wish, because fashion is the ultimate in inbuilt obsolescence. Never mind cars and electric appliances, a frock can be over and done with in one festival weekend, or even a day. And Glastonbury’s main message is about saving the planet from needless waste. They use wind and solar energy, recycle “like mad” – no plastic bags, plates or cutlery, they even recycle/compost your excrement, and beg you not to pee in the river, murdering the fish. And please buy a decent tent that lasts, they say. “A tent is for life, not just for a festival.” Isn’t that admirable? So why introduce the throwaway world of fashion to Glasto? Keep away, you poncey fashionistas, glampers and manipulators who are sullying what’s left of the festival spirit. Because there still is some, even if it does cost £238 a ticket. And, of course, there’s always the music."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/live/2020/jan/15/us-china-trade-deal-trump-tariffs-global-risks-uk-inflation-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-15T22:02:35Z","webTitle":"US and China sign Phase One trade deal, but experts are sceptical - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/15/us-china-trade-deal-trump-tariffs-global-risks-uk-inflation-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2020/jan/15/us-china-trade-deal-trump-tariffs-global-risks-uk-inflation-business-live","fields":{"headline":"US and China sign Phase One trade deal, but experts are sceptical - as it happened","bodyText":"Wall Street traders have donned their “Dow 29,000” hats, to mark today’s rally. Donald Trump will hope that trade war optimism, and the hint of tax cuts later this year, might see them wearing “Dow 30,000” before November. But that is for another day. Until tomorrow, goodnight! GW Boom! Wall Street has ended at a new all time closing high. Relief that the Phase One trade deal with China is finally signed lifted stocks, despite the agreement’s flaw. The Dow closed up 91 points, or 0.3%, at 29,031, having earlier hit an intraday peak at 29,127 points. With the Phase One trade deal in the bag, Donald Trump is now hosting a lunch for the Chinese delegation and his own officials. The president sound upbeat, saying that relations between the two sides are better than ever. Here’s my colleague Dominic Rushe on today’s trade deal: Donald Trump has signed the first phase of a new trade agreement with China after two years of tension between the two superpowers that have rattled economies around the world. Trump said: “Today, we are taking a momentous step towards a future of fair and reciprocal trade. Together we are righting the wrong of the past.” “At long last Americans have a government that puts them first at the negotiating table,” he said. “This is the biggest deal anybody has ever seen.” Trump and China’s chief trade negotiator, Liu He, signed the deal at a packed press conference, attended by Ivanka Trump, much of Trump’s cabinet, Henry Kissinger, and media and business leaders including Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman of Blackstone, and Ajay Banga, the president of Mastercard. The signing came hours after Democrats named the team that will prosecute Trump in an impeachment trial that starts early next week. The first phase of the deal will further open the Chinese market to US companies, and includes roughly $200bn in Chinese purchases of American goods and services. But it will also leave in place much of the $360bn worth of tariffs that the US has already imposed on Chinese goods, and the threat of additional punishment if Beijing does not live up to the terms of the deal. Trump campaigned on tackling what he saw as China’s unfair trade practices, accusing the country of “raping” the US and perpetuating “the greatest theft in the history of the world”. The often rancorous trade dispute has hurt agriculture, manufacturing and other sectors of the US economy, and the uncertainty it has engendered has worried business leaders. But its impact on the broader economy does not appear to have been as dire as some predicted. The trade deal, if it holds, could be a major political boost for Trump in an election year when he can argue his tough stance with China has paid off. US stock markets hit new record highs ahead of the signing. Anahita Thoms, Head of the Trade Practice at law firm Baker McKenzie in Germany, has also kicked the tires of the trade deal....and come away unimpressed. She says that both sides will have concerns -- so we could see Phase Two, Three and Four trade deals in the years ahead. Phase One, though, is not a major breakthrough: “Ultimately, trade wars produce losers. The US has lost because of inevitably higher prices for consumers, whilst China has lost because overall the volume of its trade will fall. However, other countries such as Vietnam have benefitted in the short term by taking advantage of the changing trade opportunities, but in the long term, we will all lose because global growth is negatively impacted when the two biggest economies engage in a trade war for years.” “For now, Phase One doesn’t strike a deal in a comprehensive way. In the beginning, the goal was about securing IP rights, easing the issues around forced technology transfer, market access and subsidies. In regards to Phase One, we are not there yet. Many, before President Trump, have tried to reach such a comprehensive deal, but it remains elusive for now.” Nick Marro, analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, also has concerns about the deal. He’s not convinced that China can meet its pledge of buying $200bn of extra goods from America each year. And even if it can, what happens in 2022 when the deal expires? Marro fears that the trade war could flare up again, despite today’s upbeat (and sometimes rambling) signing ceremony. He says: The trade war has demonstrated the problems of overexposure to a single market. But rather than encouraging export diversification, the trade deal risks exacerbating this over reliance through its purchase targets. This is especially because much of these purchases will come via artificially generated demand, rather than market dynamics. Once the two year time frame is up, and China thinks about diversifying its imports, what might happen to US farmers who have since ramped up domestic production on expectations of Chinese demand? At face value, it’s not encouraging as a completely sustainable trade framework going forward. The deal has some encouraging language, but it’s provisions still leave open questions around the severe structural issues in the US-China trade relationship. This, combined with likely difficulties in implementing many of these commitments, suggests that there is a high risk that the deal might fall apart later this year. Companies may need to seriously consider the scenarios around a resumption in tariff hostilities. Dr Kerstin Braun, President of Stenn Group, is also giving the phase one deal a muted reception. She says America hasn’t made progress on key issues, including subsidies for Chinese companies that tilt the playing field unfairly. “The US China phase one deal is long-awaited good news for global trade, which took a hit from the tariff war in 2019 to the tune of $420 billion in lost revenue for exporters. “But while it’s a start, the deal fails to cover the significant issues that prompted the war in the first place. This includes China’s preferential support of state-owned enterprises and technology transfer from American companies doing business there. “Both sides need to accept the larger picture. For the US, it’s that China as an economic power is not going away. For China, it’s that to be in the world marketplace means complying with international business standards. “With a weakened World Trade Organisation and the general trend away from multilateral trade agreements, we’re only going to see more trade squabbles. “China is already showing it can be less dependent on the US economy. China’s exports grew slightly last year overall, but exports to the US dropped 12.5%.” Is today’s deal as momentous as Donald Trump claimed today? No, according to Tim Drayson, Head of Economics at Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM). He says the deal doesn’t address key issues, will be hard for China to stick to, and still leaves trade barriers in place: “The signing of the ‘Phase One’ trade deal marks the widely anticipated ceasefire in Trump’s trade war with China. While this could hold through to November, it probably marks the peak in improving news on the US and China relationship. First, the majority of the existing tariffs remain in place, with no timetable for their removal. Second, it will be difficult for China to meet its target for purchases of US goods. Third, the deal lacks a credible enforcement mechanism. Finally, progress on the key structural issues remain extremely limited.” Details of the trade deal are now being released by the White House. It includes a pledge by China to buy another $200bn of US goods over the next two years, and will come into effect in 30 days. However, China only appears to be promising to buy an extra $33bn of agricultural products (unless I’m missing something). Manufacturing goods: at least $32.9bn more in 2020, rising to $44.8bn more in 2021 Agricultural products: at least $12.5bn more in 2020, rising to $19.5bn in 2021. Energy products: at least $18.5bn more in 2020, rising to $33.9bn in 2021 Services: at least $12.8bn more in 2020, rising to $25.1 in 2021 China has also promised to restrict its requests for access to confidential data when reviewing whether to allow US companies to access its markets, and pledge to speed up the process for authorising US biotech products. That will address some concerns about ‘forced technology transfers’, and the opening up of China’s markets. Donald Trump signals to some of the audience to gather round to see the signing. They don’t need asking twice, and soon the stage is packed. The president is clearly keen to make this Phase One agreement seem like a very Big Deal. But be clear, this is not a comprehensive deal to fully end the trade war. That’s why Trump hasn’t lowered tariffs on China’s goods today. Finally, after more than 18 months of trade conflict, America and China are signing the preliminary trade deal. Donald Trump sets the scene in the White House, saying “The world is watching today, it’s a great honour to be here”. Then he shakes hands with vice-premier Liu He, and the pair head over to the desks where a few copies of the agreement are waiting. A few strokes of the pens later, and the deal is done! Liu He is now issuing a serious warning to the US politicians and business leaders in the White House. He says China and America must work closer together to tackle the world’s problems. Co-operation is the only right choice, he insists. We must work together, with mutual respect. Reminder: earlier today the World Economic Forum warned that environmental dangers are now the top risks facing the global economy. A trade war between Washington and Beijing undermines the global co-operation needed. Simon Evenett,professor of economics at the University of St Gallen, smells a doll-sized rat.... Liu He now turns to his own remarks. He insists that today’s deal is “mutually beneficial”, and complies with trade rules. We will honour it strictly, he promises. Liu is hopeful that the Phase Two talks will go well, citing an old proverb that “a good beginning is the hardest part”. He then says that China will import $40bn of US agricultural goods. If there’s strong demand, they can import more, he adds. [Trump earlier cited a $50bn figure....] Trump is now inviting vice-premier Liu He to address the room (after joking that Liu deserves a break after all his hard work and should catch a movie). Liu produces a letter from his boss, president Xi Jinping! It’s addressed to Donald Trump. The letter begins with Xi telling Trump that conclusion of the phase one trade agreement between China and the US is good for both countries, and the whole world. We need equality and mutual respect, to tackle issues together, says Xi. Both sides must implement the deal in “real earnestness”, and make progress in trade and economic co-operation. Healthy and steady growth in relations will need efforts from both sides. Xi also says that he hopes that US treats Chinese companies fairly, and promises to work closely with Trump. I believe that under our guidance, China-US relations will deliver more results and provide more benefits for our people Xi concludes by wishing the Trump family best wishes, and happiness and success in the Chinese new year. Looking ahead, Donald Trump says the US and China will start talking about a Phase Two deal as this deal kicks in. But in the meantime, the tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports will remain in place. We’re leaving tariffs on, but I will agree to take them off if we agree phase two, the president says. We need the tariffs, or we won’t have any cards to pay with, he adds. And Trump concludes his remarks by claiming that “this is the biggest deal that anyone’s ever seen”. It will bring “harmony, prosperity, commerce and much more between the US and China”, and “lead to even stronger world peace.” Honestly.... Trump has finally returned to the details of the US-China trade talks. He says Beijing has agreed to “greatly expand” the products it buys from America, and will buy “much more than $200bn” over the next two years. That includes more than $50bn on agriculture products, $75bn on manufacturing products, and $50bn of energy. He says it also contains very strong IP protections, very strong restrictions on currency devaluations, and has “total and full enforceability”. [But given the WTO is so weak, how will this deal really be enforced, I wonder...] Trump reckons that China is now more open to US beef, pork, dairy, animal feed, and biotechnology. I’m not saying the president is rambling (well, he is...) but Bloomberg TV has now switched away from the trade deal signing ceremony. Viewers probably got the point, after thirty minutes of Trump patting his officials, and himself, on the back. Trump now wants to know why investors will pay for other countries’ debt, but not Americas. The president says this is unfair -- who is crazy enough to accept a guaranteed loss? The reason... is that German debt (for example) is seen as a safe place to place your capital, so it’s worth paying over the face value of the bonds. Also, the European Central Bank might buy those bonds off you for an even higher price, as part of its stimulus plan. Some of America’s top business leaders are in the room, and President Trump is naming them in turn. Most of them are doing incredibly well, Trump says, and it’s all thanks to him (I think this is a joke, but with this president you never know...) He spots Boeing’s CEO David Calhoun, saying he has a big job turning the aircraft maker around after the 737 Max crisis. Not your fault, David, says Trump generously. You’ll straighten it out quickly, I hope? We will, pledges Calhoun, as Trump moves on... ...to the chief of eBay. Trump isn’t happy that items he signs are turning up on the online auction site the next day, such as signed sneakers at $5,000. Sometimes it’s Senators and Congresspeople doing it, he puns. OK, Trump’s veered waaaay away from the trade deal. He’s now banging on about changing regulations so that a firework display can be held at Mount Rushmore. At least he’s not talking about having his name chiseled into the rockface (yet...). But it’s a really rambling performance: Here’s a clip of Donald Trump’s opening comments on the trade deal, before he diverted into picking out allies in the audience and thanking them for their work. Donald Trump is now name-checking various members of his administration, including Mike Pompeo, and thanking them for their work. He takes a swipe at Congress, saying some of his audience may need to leave to vote in the “impeachment hoax”. The president then picks out some friends in the audience, including Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, who Trump modestly says “always liked me, because he’s so smart”. I’m really not sure what the Chinese delegation make of it all, but they’re standing politely and applauding occasionally while Trump hands out his verbal bouquets. Trump turns to Robert Lighthizer, joking that his trade representative has been kept pretty busy in the last couple of years. Was this deal easier or harder than you thought, Robert?, asks Trump innocently. Harder, says Lighthizer ruefully. Trump also gives his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, credit for helping on the trade deal (even though Lighthizer’s team appeared to do the heavy lifting). And in a jovial mood, Trump jokes about how his advisor Larry Kudlow managed to talk the stock market up again after it suffered a rare $1trn selloff last year. Vice-president Mike Pence takes the podium. “This is a good day for America, China and the world,” says Pence, saying the deal helps to “put America first”. Differences will remain between our two countries, but today’s deal signing marks a new, more productive relationship, Pence continues. Actually, that’s a good point -- today’s signing ceremony is significant, if it means Washington and Beijing are on the path towards a full ceasefire in the trade war. The White House band is playing, as Donald Trump and Liu He arrive. Everyone’s on their feet. The president speaks first. Today, we are taking a momentous step towards a future of fair and reciprocal trade, says Trump. Together we are righting the wrong of the past. He claims that the Phase One trade deal will provide economic security for US families, businesses and farmers. And in a piece of classic Trump, the president says that many people thought such a deal was impossible (who exactly?!), but it should have happened a long time ago. Trump speaks warmly of Liu He being a friend, and says he will visit China in the ‘not too distant future’. The room is now packed. And at the front, there are two desks, each bearing several documents - presumably ready to be signed by Trump and Liu. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have just arrived in the East Room, ready for the deal signing. We’re expecting Donald Trump to sign it for the US, with vice-premier Liu He representing China. Seats are filling up fast in the East Room of the White House, ready for the signing ceremony for the phase one trade deal. The Nasdaq index of tech stocks has also hit a new all-time high, over 9,298 points. The signing of the US-China trade deal is due to take place in around 10 minutes. But despite the White House’s best efforts, it’s not the biggest story in Washington today. This is: Wall Street’s ‘fear index’ has dropped to its lowest level of the year: Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new all-time high. These optimistic noises from Larry Kudlow and Stephen Mnuchin may be cheering New York traders, encouraging them to drive stocks higher. This has lifted the Dow by 0.5%, or 150 points, to 29,089 -- a new peak. A former White House cabinet secretary, Chris Lu, has warned that American consumers are paying the price for Donald Trump’s trade wars. Lu, who served under Barack Obama, points out that the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods arriving at US ports are a burden on consumers (as the importer pays them). China is hoping that the White House might roll back some tariffs in the coming months, if the Phase One trade deal holds up. That’s according to the Global Times, a Chinese newspaper which is a good guide to Beijing’s thinking. It says: China and the US are set to sign the long-awaited phase one trade deal on Wednesday (US time); the deal, which involves a nine-chapter text, has fully taken into account the concerns and interests of both countries, and it is expected to bring the world’s two largest economies back on track to stable and sound development, experts close to the deal told the Global Times on Wednesday. The hard-won text involves nine chapters, touching sectors such as intellectual property rights (IPR), technology transfer, food and agricultural products, financial services, exchange rates and transparency, trade expansion as well as bilateral assessments and dispute settlement mechanisms. “The phase one deal, which is signed based on an equal footing, is in the interests of both countries and will be a constraining force on both China and the US,” Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing who is close to the trade talks, told the Global Times on Wednesday. As the two reached consensus on the phase-one deal, US agreed to lower tariffs on $120 billion worth of Chinese products to 7.5 percent from 15 percent, but a 25 percent tariff remains on roughly $250 billion worth of Chinese products. The US also rolled back plans to impose tariffs on all additional imports. “The tariffs will be further scrapped when negotiations in the upcoming months run smoothly,” Gao said. Larry Kudlow is now talking up the US-China trade deal, saying it will be good for the American economy, and the wider global economy. Nothing like this has ever happened before. I don’t care what side of the aisle you’re on, this is a fantastic deal. But he also confirms that issues such as the subsidies paid to Chinese firms, and technology licensing are not covered in today’s deal. Q: But are there any plans to lower tariffs on Chinese tariffs? If the agreements in this deal are adhered to, it will make Phase Two much easier, Kudlow replies. In other words, if America decides China isn’t abiding by its pledges, tariffs won’t be cut. So much for worrying about the deficit! National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, a top economic adviser to President Trump, has revealed that the White House plans to unveil a plan for additional tax cuts later in 2020. Speaking to CNBC, Kudlow revealed the move would come in the summer -- when the presidential election campaign would be intensifying “I am still running a process of Tax Cuts 2.0. We’re many months away – it’ll come out something later during the campaign. Tax Cuts 2.0 to help middle-class economic growth: That’s still our goal.” Kudlow added: “I had a tremendous meeting with my friend Kevin Brady, who will undoubtedly be the new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. But we will unveil this perhaps sometimes later in the summer.” Thee excitement around the US-China phase-one trade deal has already faded in markets, even before the ink is wet on the paper. So says Silvia Dall’Angelo, Senior Economist at Hermes Investment Management. The deal is now expected to bear only limited fruit: US officials suggested overnight that in the absence of a phase-two agreement, the US is unlikely to roll back further tariffs against China before the Presidential elections later this year. That is hardly surprising. The deal seemed already fragile when it was announced in mid-December: details were scant (a full document will be provided only after the signing), some of the commitments (such as the $200bn step-up in Chinese purchases of US goods and services in the next two years) seemed unrealistic, and there was extreme vagueness concerning some crucial aspects such as intellectual property protections and technological transfers. All in all, trade tensions between the US and China might well re-surface over the course of the year, also depending on how US domestic electoral dynamics pan out in coming months.” Wall Street has opened calmly, as investors await today’s Phase One trade deal signing. The Dow has gained 60 points, or 0.2%, up to 28,999 points --- tantalising close to the 29k level hit for the first time last week. Mnuchin also told reporters that the White House is “indifferent” to whether the tariffs on US-China trade are reduced before, or after, November’s election. I’m not sure that America farmers share this relaxed approach, given the drop in soybean sales. US firms who have to either absorb tariffs on Chinese imports or pass then onto consumers are also keen to see progress. Treasury secretary Mnuchin has also been challenged over the US deficit, which has jumped by over 11% according to new figures. Is it safe to be borrowing so much, and does this show that Donald Trump’s tax cuts aren’t working? Mnuchin (ever loyal), insists that the Trump tax cuts will pay for themselves over the next decade. He blames spending commitments, rather than taxes, for the yawning deficit. There’s no question that over time, we need to look at government spending issues. That’s the cause of the deficit, not tax cuts. That’s likely to alarm those who fear cuts to social security and Medicare. Military spending has also gone up sharply, and could rise further if geopolitical tensions increase. It’s fair to say that global investors don’t quite share Stephen Mnuchin’s excitement about today’s trade deal ceremony. There’s plenty of disappointment that the White House isn’t cutting some of the tariffs imposed on Chinese imports since the trade war began in 2018 (one CIO dubbed these tariffs a ‘roach motel’ overnight) Investors have also noted that the big issues, such as intellectual property protection and subsidies, have been deferred until a future Phase Two deal Hugh Grieves, fund manager at Premier Miton, says the Phase One agreement doesn’t end the war: “The phase 1 trade deal due to be signed later today will allow both Presidents Trump and Xi to claim a political victory after a bruising two-year trade war. When the details of the agreement are released however, we will be shown just how much, or (more likely) how little, structural reform China has committed to in return for just $200bn of increased imports (equal to only approximately half of China’s 2018 bilateral trade deficit) and some tariff reduction. “But whatever the details in this limited agreement, it does not resolve the underlying tensions, both political and economic, between the two countries and therefore investors should expect further tensions to be a feature of the future investing landscape.” Newsflash: The Phase-One trade deal that America and China will sign today is an “enormous win”. That’s according to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin, who is speaking outside the White House now. Mnuchin insists that this preliminary deal is a great success, even though it doesn’t appear to cover important issues such as cyber crime. This is the first time that we’ve had an agreement with China that addresses agricultural purchases, structural reforms, financial services and currency issues, says Mnuchin. He adds that China has also agreed to buy “$200bn of additional things” over the next few years. Sweeping aside fears that the deal is a damp squib, he says the White House expects “significant growth” this year. This is an enormous win. The average consumer will see a stronger economy in 2020 thanks to this deal.... The deal itself should be signed in a few hours time (11.30am in Washington, or 4.30pm UK time). Just in: British Airways’ owner IAG has filed an official complaint to the European Commission over the rescue of Flybe. The move comes amid a growing backlash to the government’s rescue of the ailing regional carrier from rival airlines, opposition politicians, and environmentalists. My colleague Gwyn Topham explains: IAG has written to the competition directorate of the EU saying that the rescue deal announced on Tuesday night by ministers, which could include a £100m loan and deferral of an outstanding tax bill, contravenes state aid rules. IAG’s chief executive, Willie Walsh, had earlier described the deal as “a blatant misuse of public funds”. The European Commission said it was ready to discuss with Britain its rescue of regional airline Flybe, noting that any state aid should be designed to avoid the distortion of competition and a level playing field. Here’s the full story: Tackling the climate emergency will need some tough decisions. The UK government faces one in the North of England, where a new £165m coalmine in Cumbria is being planned. But a new report, from Lancaster University professors Rebecca Willis and Mike Berners-Lee, shows that the mine would undercut the UK’s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. They’ve calculated that the mine would produce 8.4m tonnes of CO2 per year, equivalent to the emissions from more than 1 million households. Here’s the full story: Our economics editor Larry Elliott is back from WEF’s press conference on its Global Risks report, and says: A year of extreme weather events and mounting evidence of global heating have catapulted the climate emergency to the top of the list of issues worrying the world’s elite. The World Economic Forum’s annual risks report found that, for the first time in its 15-year history, the environment filled the top five places in the list of concerns likely to have a major impact over the next decade. Børge Brende, President of the World Economic Forum, said: “The political landscape is polarised, sea levels are rising and climate fires are burning. This is the year when world leaders must work with all sectors of society to repair and reinvigorate our systems of cooperation, not just for short-term benefit but for tackling our deep-rooted risks.” After a month that has seen bush fires raging out of control in Australia, Brende said there was a need for urgent action. “We have only a very small window and if we don’t use that window in the next 10 years we will be moving around the deckchairs on the Titanic.”... More here: WEF have tweeted about their Risks Report (which is online here). Top decision makers under the age of 40 have particularly strong concerns about climate, today’s WEF Risks Report has found. It says: The report highlights how risks are seen by those born after 1980. They ranked environmental risks higher than other respondents, in the short- and long- terms. Almost 90% of these respondents believe “extreme heat waves”, “destruction of ecosystems” and “health impacted by pollution” will be aggravated in 2020; compared to 77%, 76% and 67% respectively for other generations. They also believe that the impact from environmental risks by 2030 will be more catastrophic and more likely. So is there any hope? Emily Farnworth, head of climate change at WEF, argues that there is. The Paris Agreement of 2015 sent businesses a clear signal that governments want slow their emissions. She’s also optimistic that social and technology entrepreneurs, springing up around the world, can deliver the “exponential change” needed if the 2020s are to be a “decade of delivery”. We know what the challenge is, we need to get on and address it. WEF’s Risks Report has also predicted that 2020 will see rising political and social tensions, both within countries and between them. So with the added risk of economic slowdown, it could be a turbulent year. 78% of survey respondents said they expect “economic confrontations” and “domestic political polarization” to rise in 2020. Increased political polarisation, extreme heat waves and the destruction of the natural environment are also worryingly likely, with policymakers struggling to make the progress needed on the climate emergency. Here are the six key points from the report (online here). Geopolitical Instability: National politics in many countries has evidenced intense divisiveness and ‘pushbacks’, coupled with increasingly fractious international relations. These volatilities will likely persist, challenging cooperation on key priorities. Economic Concerns: As economic confrontations between major powers grow, the global economy shows greater signs of a concerted slowdown. Climate Response Shortcomings: Weak international agreements belie rising investor and popular pressure for action, against a backdrop of a multitude of natural catastrophes and indicators of longer-term disruptions. 2020 is a critical year for nations to accelerate progress towards major emissions reductions and boosting adaption investments. Biodiversity Loss Impacts: Many ecosystems are in decline or at risk of distinction. Biodiversity loss poses irreversible consequences to societies, economies, and the health of the planet. Technological Governance Deficits: Emerging technology risks can erode social discourse, threaten economic stability, exacerbate geostrategic competition, and pressure national and international security. Getting a better handle on systemic risks will require a significant technology governance refresh at all levels. Creaking Health Systems: Changing societal, environmental, demographic, and technological trends are straining health systems globally. While transformative technology, medicines, and insurance can improve healthcare, they also introduce new risks and trade-offs. Britain’s weak inflation is likely to spur the Bank of England to cut interest rates this month, says Garry Young of economic thinktank NIESR. But he’s not convinced they should.... The surprise fall in UK inflation to 1.3% has knocked the pound back below $1.30. Traders are (understandably) concluding that an interest rate cut is more likely. Significantly, core inflation has dropped to just 1.4%, from 1.7% in November -- showing price pressures are weakening. Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, says: The Bank of England has been studiously steering interest rate expectations lower, but this morning’s collapse in core inflation further increased the likelihood that rates will be cut to 0.5% when the MPC meets on 30th January. Core inflation is now back at the levels last seen in 2016.” Shops slashed women’s clothing prices particularly sharply last month, the Office for National Statistics says: The largest individual downward contributions came from women’s casual jackets and cardigans, where prices fell between November and December 2019 but rose between the same two months in 2018. There were also small individual downward contributions from formal trousers and formal skirts. There is evidence of increased discounting, with the proportion of women’s clothing items recorded on sale being higher in December 2019 than in December 2018. Britain’s inflation rate has fallen to a three-year low, making an early interest rate cut increasingly likely. The Consumer Prices Index fell to just 1.3% in December, down from 1.5% in November, to its lowest since November 2016. That’s some way below the Bank of England’s target of 2%. Clothing and restaurants had the biggest downward push on prices. That suggests that retailers have been forced to slash prices to encourage customers through their doors. Q: Is China engaging enough on these issues? Brende replies that it is crucial that China is a part of the global fight against climate. He points out that they have lead a major role in solar and wind power, helping to drive prices down. China has been a “responsible player in sticking to multilateral agreements”....”We cannot succeed... without China on board”, Brende says. Q: Is WEF concerned about the new, pneumonia-like virus spreading in China? The world is not ready for another pandemic, Brende replies sternly. Børge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, warns that policymakers only have 10 years to address the climate emergency - otherwise they’ll just be “moving deckchairs on the Titanic”. But he’s also optimistic, pointing out that the cost of solar energy is 10 times as cheap as a decade ago. A lot can happen in 10 years, if people react. Here are some key charts from WEF’s risks report, showing how environmental issues (coloured green) are now seen as the biggest threat to the global economy. WEF are now taking questions.... firstly from my colleague Larry Elliott. Q: Next week, lots of the CEOs who say they want to fight the climate emergency will be flying to Davos in their private jets - isn’t there a major reality gap here? Most people who go to Davos go by rail, WEF’s Adrian Monck replies [Larry and I will be chugging up the mountain next week] There’s biofuel at Zurich Airport if you want to top up your private jet, and the Annual Meeting is going to be carbon neutral, Monck adds. But he agrees that Davos needs to do more than just pay lip service to environmental issues. There’s nothing worse than an organisation recognising a risk and doing nothing about it, which is why we take it so seriously. Biodiversity loss and a warming planet are linked, Giger adds -- one can lead to the other. Businesses, consumers and regulators....need to prioritise investments that protect the planet. Peter Giger, Zurich’s group chief risk officer, says the loss of biodiversity is a very serious risk to the global economy. We rely on biodiversity, from pollinating crops to curing diseases. John Drzik, chairman of financial service firm Marsh &amp; McLennan Insights, is now speaking at the Global Risks report press conference. He says there is mounting pressure on the public sector to act on environmental risks, in the face of rising threats. The situation is “bad and getting worse”, Drzik says. Climate impact was very visible in 2019, he says, citing wildfires in Australia, Europe and California, and flooding in other regions. The business community need to focus with more intensity on the risks from climate emergency, but also the opportunities, Drzik continues. Drzik says investors and regulators are taking the issue more seriously, so bosses need to do the same. He cited BlackRock’s decision yesterday to focus on sustainable investment, following heavy criticism for its investment in fossil fuels. The World Economic Forum is outlining its Risks Report at a press conference in London now. The first chapter is called “An Unsettled World” - focusing on the current fractured global situation. This is making it harder to tackle issues such as the climate emergency. WEF’s Mirek Dusek explains: It is the super-risk. All the other risks that we need to contend with, there is this drag that we have to contend with - that we live in a more polarised, more competitive world. The Risks Report also focuses on environmental issues -- such as the threat of accelerated biodiversity loss. A conservative estimate says we are losing 200 to 2,000 species per year -- this is an issue of critical importance. NEWSFLASH: the World Economic Forum’s new global risks report is out! And for first time in its 15 year history, the top five global risks to the global economy over the next decade are all related to the environment. This confirms that the climate emergency has rocketed to the top of the global agenda, with business leaders and economists now awake to the dangers from rising temperatures. The top five are: Extreme weather events Failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation Human made environmental damage and disaster Major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse Major natural disasters such as earthquakes. This comes from a survey of 759 global experts and decision makers across the globe, many of whom will be travelling to Davos next week for WEF’s Annual Meeting. WEF are announcing more details from the report now.... Michael Saunders has also produced this chart, showing why he believes UK interest rates should be cut: Newsflash: Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders has warned that the UK economy appears to be stagnating. Speaking in Northern Ireland right now, Saunders says that is recent business surveys suggest there is ‘little or no growth’ in the British economy right now. So with growth sluggish, Saunders favours an “expansionary monetary policy stance” -- ie lower interest rates. In a speech titled Risk management in a sluggish economy, he says: “It probably will be appropriate to maintain an expansionary monetary policy stance and possibly to cut rates further, in order to reduce risks of a sustained undershoot of the 2% inflation target. With limited monetary policy space, risk management considerations favour a relatively prompt and aggressive response to downside risks at present.” Saunders is one of two policymakers who voted to cut interest rates at the Bank’s last meeting in December. Other members of the Monetary Policy Committee have sounded dovish since, meaning rates could be lowered at the next meeting in a fortnight. Howard Archer of EY Item Club reckons Saunders is certain to vote for a cut again. Unusually, the full text of the Phase One trade deal hasn’t been released yet. But Reuters has heard some details: China has pledged to buy almost $80 billion of additional manufactured goods from the United States over the next two years as part of a trade war truce, according to a source, though some U.S. trade experts call it an unrealistic target. Under the Phase 1 trade deal to be signed on Wednesday in Washington, China would also buy over $50 billion more in energy supplies and boost purchases of U.S. services by about $35 billion over the same period, the source, who was briefed on the deal, told Reuters late on Monday. The agreement also calls for Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods to increase by some $32 billion over two years, or roughly $16 billion a year, said the source. Donald Trump famously claimed that trade wars were good and easy to win. But Washington’s refusal to dial back the tariffs on $360bn Chinese goods shows clearly that trade wars are hard to get out of. Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Advisory Group, says US businesses need to hunker down, as they can’t escape these tariffs easily. We’re still stuck with these tariffs which are a drag on growth in trade and manufacturing These tariffs have now become a roach motel.” (for those unversed in Americanisms, this means a place you can easily get into, but struggle to escape) Asia-Pacific stocks have been hit by America’s refusal to lift tariffs on Chinese goods. Almost all the major indices are in the red, as traders face up to the prospect of more trade tensions this year. China’s CSI300 index is down 0.5%, with India’s Sensex losing 0.6%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The US and China will finally sign their Phase One trade deal today, but there’s no much celebration in the markets. President Donald Trump and vice-premier Liu He will both put their signatures to the agreement, at a ceremony in Washington later today. The deal should calm the turbulent trade conflict between the two nations which blew up in 2018, slowing global trade and hurting the world economy. We can expect Trump to talk up the deal as a major breakthrough, with Beijing agreeing to buy up to $50bn of US agricultural products per year. But the fizz is going flat, even before the corks fly out of the bottles. That’s because the White House has already declared that the existing tariffs imposed over the last 18 months or so will remain in place until a full trade deal deal is agreed. That means tariffs on $360bn of Chinese imports will remain in place, probably until after November’s presidential election. Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin broke the news to reporters overnight, saying: “These tariffs will stay in place until there is a Phase 2. If the president gets a Phase 2 in place quickly, he’ll consider releasing tariffs as part of Phase 2.” We don’t know exactly what’s in the 80-page Phase One deal, but it appears to duck some of the really serious sticking points, such as intellectual property protections and China’s subsidies of its companies. Investors fear that a comprehensive trade deal could take a long time to agree, given the long grind just to agree Phase One. There’s also concern that China might not stick to the deal, meaning it could swiftly unravel: As Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, puts it: The US – China trade deal is like watching a live show in the theatre of the absurd. The Trump administration revealed a detail that nobody expected just before the signature of the phase-one trade deal today: the tariff cuts will not take effect before the US election in November. This means that the US tariffs will continue weighing on Chinese exports for almost an additional year, while the emerging market giant will certainly be asked to deliver on its promise to buy massive amounts of US farm goods and manufactured products immediately. The risk here is that the double-standard agreement could provide a weak basis for the future negotiations, impair the benefits, or even spoil the deal. So don’t bank on major action in the markets today, although the Dow Jones industrial average did briefly jump over 29,000 points yesterday, before tariff fears struck.... Also coming up today The World Economic Forum are releasing their annual Global Risks report, identifying the key threats to the global economy ahead of next week’s gathering in Davos. Trade wars, the climate emergency and geopolitical tensions will probably feature highly. We also get the latest UK inflation data - a weak reading could give the Bank of England more leeway to consider an interest rate cut.

The energy grid around Esperance and Ravensthorpe is unreliable at the best of times, but after a bushfire took out the poles and wires around these far-flung outback towns last year, the power company asked residents if they might be interested in trying out a more economically and environmentally sustainable way to keep the lights on and the bar fridge humming. Rather than fully rebuild the sprawling infrastructure required to reconnect all residents to the grid, network operator Horizon Power turned to WA renewables pioneer Carnegie Clean Energy to help roll out stand-alone solar and storage systems. The Carnegie managing director, Michael Ottaviano, said the scheme had led to a new phenomenon in the towns. “People assume the grid is something reliable and permanent, but in reality it is a centralised system with very long lines out to remote communities – it is in fact highly susceptible to failure,” he says. “And when it does now we’re hearing our customers are having blackout parties. You take Raventhorpe for instance, which has several hundred houses, only half a dozen of which have our systems – the people living there suddenly become very popular when the power goes out.” Rodney Locke, a farmer near Esperance, says blackouts had plagued his property long before the Yarloop bushfire decimated the area’s energy infrastructure last year. He says he jumped at Horizon Power’s offer for an alternative way of doing things. He had his property fitted out with a solar and storage system, and has had the odd visitor since – although nothing too out of hand, he says. “There are a couple of people we know who drop in once a week anyway, so, well, if there’s a blackout, instead of sitting at home in the dark, they come and visit,” he says. “The beer does stay colder with the power on – it doesn’t have to be drunk as quick. Actually, come to think of it, maybe it should be the other way round? Maybe we should be the ones visiting the places with no power – help drink their beer before it gets warm.” It is but one small example of how perceptions around solar energy are changing in what remains one of Australia’s most politically conservative states. Once regarded as an eco-warrior’s pipe dream, renewable energy is suddenly the hottest ticket in WA, a gateway to independence in a fiercely self-reliant place. A breakdown of data from the Clean Energy Regulator has concluded the state is rising in the solar energy national rankings. Analyst Warwick Johnston, the managing director of SunWiz, said WA’s rise is the most notable outtake from the industry research. “The biggest change has been Western Australia leapfrogging Victoria into third place when it comes to the number of new solar installations,” he says. Queensland and New South Wales remain in first and second position respectively. Johnston noted solar installations numbers spiked in late 2016, and continued on into the new year, with the first quarter of 2017 one of the industry’s strongest-ever periods. He partly credited solar and storage systems like those rolled out by Horizon Power in Ravensthorpe and Esperance for the growth. “With batteries now readily available on the market, many people are taking this opportunity to install both solar and batteries – or to upgrade the size of their existing solar systems,” he says. “The price of solar has dropped low enough and power prices are rising high enough for this to make economic sense for many commercial operators, too.” The Horizon Power managing director, Frank Tudor, confirmed that increasingly affordable technology was at the heart of the growth. “Horizon Power is quickly responding to the growing demand for solar which, coupled with declining costs of the related technology, is allowing us to offer a greater range of solutions in this space,” he says. “This includes battery storage at a power station level, stand-alone power systems for individual customers and later this year, an increase in hosting capacity which will allow more solar on rooftops in many of our microgrids.” The company has also just reached agreement to expand stand-alone power systems into Exmouth, in the north of the state. Solar power has become so popular in some parts of Western Australia that there are more households equipped with panels than without. The national leader is Baldivis, south of Perth, where two-thirds of households feature rooftop solar. Other strong WA performers include Byford (56%) and Rockingham (53%). There is now six gigawatts of solar power installed across the country. The Australian Photovoltaic Institute chair, Renate Egan, said an additional 1GW was added over the past year by household-scale solar in tandem with commercial and large-scale solar farms. Egan says: “Solar power now makes up 11% of our country’s total electricity generation capacity with more solar added to the system in 2016 than any other fuel type.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/jul/06/climate-change-how-victoria-trumped-new-south-wales-in-the-great-renewable-energy-race","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-06T00:16:00Z","webTitle":"Climate change: how Victoria trumped New South Wales in the great renewable energy race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/06/climate-change-how-victoria-trumped-new-south-wales-in-the-great-renewable-energy-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/06/climate-change-how-victoria-trumped-new-south-wales-in-the-great-renewable-energy-race","fields":{"headline":"Climate change: how Victoria trumped New South Wales in the great renewable energy race","bodyText":"Two years ago Rob Stokes, the then environment minister for New South Wales, promised that his state could become Australia’s answer to California in the clean energy industry. “We are making NSW No 1 in energy and environmental policy,” Stokes, a Liberal, told the Clean Energy Week gathering in Sydney in July 2014.“When it comes to clean energy, we can be Australia’s answer to California.” It was a bold vision, and a laudable one, but it didn’t turn out that way. Investment in large-scale renewable energy, apart from some federally funded large-scale solar projects, has all but dried up. In May, a report by the Climate Council rated NSW as the “worst place” for renewable energy investment in Australia. It’s ironic because NSW has the biggest pipeline of undeveloped renewable energy projects in the country. But now other states are seeking to grab a bigger share of the renewable energy pie, particularly as traditional industries of car manufacturing and steel-making face an uncertain future. Last month Victoria became the latest Labor government to announce renewable energy targets over and above the federal target, announcing it would aim to have 25% of its electricity served by renewable energy by 2020, and 40% by 2025. That compares with a national target that translates to about a 23% by 2020, and the Australian Capital Territory’s 100% target by 2020, Queensland’s 50% target by 2030 and South Australia’s 50% target by 2025, a percentage it is likely to reach later this year. But Victoria’s target appears the most ambitious of the lot, simply for the sheer number of new wind and solar farms that will be needed to meet the target. And it also intends to have legislation in place from next year that will ensure the target is met. The 40% by 2025 target translates into some 5,400MW of new renewable energy capacity to be installed within the next 10 years. That will be almost exclusively wind and solar farms and is three times as much renewable energy capacity as the state has installed up till now and nearly equal to the national target for 2020. “This is an ambitious target but a very achievable target,” says the Victorian energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio. She intends to adopt the system of “reverse auctions” pioneered successfully by the ACT, which will have some 600MW of large scale renewables in place by 2020 to meet its own 100% target. Already, under a previously announced tender designed to support wind projects, the Victorian government has signed contracts that will help two windfarms be built over the next year – a 13-turbine windfarm at Kiata near Horsham and a 44-turbine windfarm at Mount Gellibrand near Colac. It is not the first time that Victoria has stepped into the national policy arena with its own state-based target. It did the same in 2006, when the federal target came to an unexpected standstill, and several wind turbine manufacturing facilities were closed down. At that time, the Victoria government introduced its own state target, known then as the Victorian renewable energy target, to protect jobs and get projects built. One of the few manufacturers that remain is Keppel Prince in the coastal town of Portland, which specialises in building towers for wind turbines. It recently completed an order for 35 turbines for the Ararat windfarm – which won a tender in the ACT auction system – and is looking forward to new business. “The prospects look good,” says Steve Garner, the general manager at Keppel Prince. He estimates that the target will require 150 new wind towers each year for 10 years. “That’s quite exciting for an organisation like ours,” he says. “It’s a huge boost for employment and it’s a huge boost for manufacturing. Garner was forced to slash his workforce by nearly half because of the investment drought caused by uncertainty in the federal target but he has since re-employ about 50 people and hopes that by 2017 his wind turbine division can get back up to around 300 jobs. The Clean Energy Council chief executive, Kane Thornton, says Victoria’s initiative will build confidence for the sector that has had little in the past three years. “It adds to the belief that renewables do have a strong future in this country,” Thornton says. “And it will help meet the national target, which requires 6,000MW of new capacity by 2020. “It is also smart timing ... It should see Victoria claim a big share of the renewable energy pie out to 2025 and beyond … and facilitate the creation of new jobs in emerging industries in regional and rural areas of Victoria, where renewable energy power plants are usually built. Wind is expected to be the biggest winner from the new target and Leigh Ewbank, from the Yes2Renewables campaign that brought together a number of NGOs pushing for a higher target, estimates there are about 3,000MW of large-scale wind projects in the state that are – or close to – being “shovel ready”. These include 2,300MW of “approved” projects such as the 450MW Stockland Hill and the 312MW Moorabool projects, both near Ballarat. There are another 14 approved projects of various sizes. Ewbank also says it will provide a lifeline to manufacturing groups across the state, including Keppel Prince and others such Olex Cables and Wilsons Transformers in Geelong and the western suburbs of Melbourne. “A doubling of Victoria’s wind energy capacity in less than four years is a huge opportunity for local manufacturers,” Ewbank says. “The Andrews government can get the best outcome for jobs by encouraging renewable energy companies to use local content.” Indeed, wind is not the only opportunity. D’Ambrosio also expects a significant amount of large-scale solar projects, although she says it is too early to put a number on it. That should provide opportunities for companies like IXL Solar, a subsidiary of the family-owned, Geelong-based auto parts manufacturer IXL that is looking for new opportunities in new industries. IXL Solar, which was established in 2012, is now Australia’s only manufacturer of framing systems, upon which solar panels are mounted in large solar farms. Its general manager, Claude Dagescy, says the sector has “been on hold” but there is a surge of new interest, particularly after Arena offered $100m in grant funding for large-scale solar projects. Two of 20 shortlisted projects are located in Victoria – the Gannawarra solar farm near Kerang and the Bannerton solar farm – and Dagescy says that the Victorian initiative will offer new opportunities for other projects. “We see this as quite positive. We need certainty around the policies and we need commitments from project developers.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/jul/25/de-bortoli-aims-first-zero-waste-winery-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-25T04:25:46Z","webTitle":"Wine without waste: De Bortoli aims to be Australia's first zero-waste winery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/25/de-bortoli-aims-first-zero-waste-winery-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/25/de-bortoli-aims-first-zero-waste-winery-australia","fields":{"headline":"Wine without waste: De Bortoli aims to be Australia's first zero-waste winery","bodyText":"One of Australia’s biggest family-owned wineries wants to become the country’s first zero-waste wine producer, and has invested more than $15m to achieve this goal. De Bortoli Wines, which has wineries at four sites in two states, has already cut the amount of waste it disposes to landfill from 300 tonnes a year to 48 tonnes as part of a long-term sustainable business plan adopted in 2004. This ambitious environmental management plan, which the company calls its carbon economy project, has resulted in the redesign of almost every aspect of production, from refrigeration, lighting and packaging to wine filtration pumps, compressors and composting systems for industrial waste such as grape skins, stems and seeds. It has been a massive and meticulously planned undertaking for managing director and third generation winemaker Darren De Bortoli, and the company’s operations manager, Rob Glastonbury. Although the company’s main winery is at Bilbul, a small Riverina town about six kilometres north-east of Griffith in southern New South Wales, it also owns two wineries in Victoria – in the Yarra Valley and the state’s north-east – and another at Pokolbin in the Hunter Valley in NSW. That has meant coordinating industrial energy audits, feasibility studies and production trials across the four sites, each with differing regional climates that are reflected in localised variations in energy and water consumption. De Bortoli says the family company’s commitment to sustainable business initiatives began with an application to the NSW Environment Protection Authority to expand the Bilbul winery. “We had to prepare and submit an environmental assessment to the EPA as part of the expansion plan – that led to discussions about how we could improve production systems, do things differently,” he says. The WFA has also introduced a set of policies covering water use, climate change, farm biodiversity and genetically modified organisms. The climate policy encourages members to “minimise greenhouse emissions across all stages of production” and urges federal and state governments to “adopt a consistent approach to greenhouse gas and climate change, including adaptation strategies.” De Bortoli is also a Winemakers’ Federation of Australia (WFA) committee member, and was involved in developing the WFA’s environmental policies, which cover water use, climate change, farm biodiversity and genetically modified organisms. The WFA has played a critical role in shaping the industry’s approach to sustainability. In 2000 it launched a 10-year marketing strategy that urged growers to preserve the reputation of Australia’s wines through “environmental policies which manage salinity, pollution and urban encroachment”. De Bortoli also says he gave the former prime minister Tony Abbott “quite an earful” about Murray Darling basin water reform measures, and the need to “revisit some of the policies around groundwater extraction” and salinity. The De Bortoli company became a founding member of the Australian Wine Research Institute’s environmental assurance program, Entwine. It’s a voluntary certification audit that sets environmental standards for a list of “business metrics” that include winery wastewater management, carbon emissions and use of synthetic refrigerants. Glastonbury says environmental certification doesn’t automatically “get more dollars, but it certainly opens more doors” in both global and domestic markets. “For many of our customers, unless you can tick that clean and green box, forget it. There’s an RSL club on the north coast of New South Wales, and they want to see environmental certification before they start placing orders,” he says. Glastonbury says one of the most important, and early, environmentally inspired decisions for the company was to eliminate all sodium-based chemicals used in production and cleaning because of concerns about increasing levels of soil salinity across the Murray-Darling Basin. “It was Darren’s decision, and it was a revolution – a huge change – because it meant we could reuse our waste water. It changed the industrial ecology of the business,” Glastonbury says. De Bortoli says his decision to eliminate sodium was inevitable and “a no-brainer.” “It was good sense and good science. We’re a business that’s operating in the Murray-Darling Basin and that means we’ve got to look at ways we can tackle regional issues like salinity and water efficiency.” The company switched to potassium-based cleaning agents, which means the effluent contains potash, commonly used as an agricultural fertiliser. Prior to the decision to go no-sodium, the winery’s wastewater was stored in large holding dams to allow oxygen to break down organic matter, and then transferred to evaporation basins. The waste water from the Bilbul winery is now used to irrigate grain and fodder crops on a neighbouring farm owned by the De Bortoli family, and the sale of these crops offsets the costs of wastewater management at the winery. Glastonbury says the company installed a new low-energy wastewater treatment plant at Bilbul, which has cut electricity costs by about $200,000 a year. At the Yarra Valley winery, an aerobic biotreatment plant is used to filter and recycle wastewater. It’s the largest vineyard in Australia using biological viticulture techniques based on sustainable soil management practices advocated by US soil microbiologist Dr Elaine Ingham to improve water retention and soil health. The winery has also introduced a composting system that uses waste windrows, or rows of compost heaps, to produce organic fertiliser for the vineyards. Other environmental initiatives at Yarra Valley include planting habitat and food trees for wildlife and brewing vats of compost tea using rainwater harvested onsite. Glastonbury says the sustainability master plan for the four wineries aims to improve energy and water efficiency, minimise waste and cut carbon emissions while also cutting production costs. One of the complex, long-term sustainability challenges is developing a smoother, more continuous “one shot” production system that will create further energy savings. The company is working with scientists from the University of Technology Sydney, who are studying the properties of wine particles to identify ways to minimise processing requirements. In 2013, the company installed the Australian wine industry’s biggest solar panel array at its Bilbul winery, and De Bortoli jokes that the system “pumps out so much electricity that we’re now registered as a power station”. The solar array supplements power from the grid, and has cut the company’s carbon emissions by more than 314 tonnes a year. Their efforts have been recognised and supported by the NSW government’s sustainable advantage program, and won an Australian Business award for Sustainability in 2015. The bottom line is, of course, whether the company’s carbon economy project delivers significant savings and return on investment. Glastonbury estimates that redesigning the winery’s aeration system has reduced power requirements “from 400 kW hours to eight, which saves us over $240,000 a year”. Return on investment is currently at about 20% over five years, and the company has cut its carbon emissions by more than 2,500 tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year. What’s next? De Bortoli says there are new challenges in improving cross-flow filtration methods and reducing sediments in the waste stream. “The road to becoming a sustainable business is a long and interesting one,” he says."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2016/jul/31/australia-residents-solar-rooftop-lose-payments","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-31T04:10:53Z","webTitle":"From solar boom to bill shock: Australians face loss of rooftop payments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/31/australia-residents-solar-rooftop-lose-payments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jul/31/australia-residents-solar-rooftop-lose-payments","fields":{"headline":"From solar boom to bill shock: Australians face loss of rooftop payments","bodyText":"Jonathan Shaw got solar panels installed on the roof of his home in Sydney in 2011 and ever since has been riding something of a gravy train. He has been getting 60c for every kWh he sells back to the grid. That’s much more than the 25c he pays for each kWh he buys from the grid. But that’s about to change. “We’re about to get a major reduction, I think,” says Shaw. Like many solar customers, Shaw is aware that something is going to change, but is unsure what precisely is going to happen and what he needs to do about it. He’s one of more than 275,000 people across Australia who will see the subsidised payments they receive for their solar energy disappear over the next six months, replaced with rates up to 80% lower. The solar boom in Australia, which has led to 1.5m households generating their own electricity from the sun, was accelerated by subsidised payments for people who sell solar-generated electricity back to the grid. In some cases, like Shaw’s, solar customers were able to receive more than twice the money for the electricity they put in the grid, compared with what they paid for electricity they took out of it. But for a lot of homes and businesses, those schemes are coming to an end over the next six months and, if they’re not prepared, they will be heading towards some serious bill shock. Customers in New South Wales, who got the most generous rate, will be in for the biggest hit and will need to do the most to adapt to the changes. “At best, they’ll cop a turnaround of about $1,000 or a bit more,” says Damien Moyse, energy policy manager at the Alternative Technology Association. “But if they’ve got a big system their turnaround will be two or three thousand or even more next year.” In NSW, very generous deals were on offer between 2010 and 2012. People who signed up then have been on those rates ever since. What’s more, the NSW scheme offered that rate for every kWh they produced, rather than just the excess they didn’t use themselves. But from 1 January 2017 they will get paid as little as 5.5c per kWh for the power they put back into the grid. That means the economics will completely flip, and rather than being able to rake in cash by selling electricity back to the grid they’ll want to use as much as they possibly can. “If you use the solar on site, then you’re avoiding paying 25c for every kWh,” Moyse says. “That value to you is five times higher to you than putting it into the grid at 5c.” While about 150,000 homes and business will be kicked off these schemes in NSW on 1 January 2017, the party is ending for about 130,000 customers in Victoria and South Australia too. (Others are on schemes that will continue for years to come. So if people are confused about their own feed-in tariffs, they should ask their retailer what’s happening with them.) Regardless of how much people are getting hit by the changes, the principle is the same for everyone coming off a subsidised scheme – and indeed for anyone with solar or anyone planning on getting solar without a subsidised feed-in-tariff: the way to make the most of the system is to use as much of it as people can to run appliances, displacing energy people would otherwise buy from the grid. How exactly to do that, though, can be confusing. Which appliances should be replaced? How should they be run? And are batteries a good idea? The first thing solar homes and business need to make sure they have is the right meter. Smart meters The issue of what kind of meter to get is a minefield right now, with different issues affecting consumers depending on where they are, and options are changing rapidly. One thing that can help anyone make the most of their solar electricity is a smart meter, says Claire O’Rourke, national director of Solar Citizens, a group that lobbies on behalf of solar customers. A smart meter can be read remotely, and can tell when the most power is being drawn, helping maximise the benefits. They can also open up services such as time-of-use tariffs, providing savings for people who avoid using energy during periods of high demand. “You’re probably better off with a smart meter but they do have an increased cost,” says O’Rourke. Some retailers are offering discounts for smart meters in return for fixed-term contracts. “It is really in the interest of consumers to shop around,” she says. For many people right now a smart meter could be overkill. The smart meter will either be paid upfront, or in the case of free meters offered by retailers, will be paid for through increased tariffs, says Moyse. Whether the meter will allow consumers to recoup that cost is unclear. For people outside NSW, the lowest-cost option is to keep their current meter, at least until it’s clear a smart meter is worth it. Outside NSW, the current meter will work fine on the new deals. Unfortunately, for most people on the NSW solar bonus scheme, their meters will need to be replaced. For those customers, their meters were sending all of their solar generation into the grid. And all the electricity used was coming from out of the grid. So really, these consumers were not using any of their solar power directly. So effectively, those who do not change meters will receive a small feed-in tariff for all of their solar generation, and then be buying all the electricity they use from the grid at a higher rate. In technical terms, those customers are only doing “gross metering” but after 1 January, if they want to sell any energy back to the grid they need to be doing “net metering”. But whether people will need a whole new meter – which could cost about $600 – or for the current meter to be rewired, depends on where in NSW they are, and who the electricity distributor is. Moyse says rather than rushing to get a meter upgrade, it might be best to wait a few weeks or even months after 1 January, when there will be time to compare the various offers. “It doesn’t matter even if you go a few months with your current meter,” he says. “The economic impact of that doesn’t matter too much, compared to if you change your meter early. It might cost you tens of dollars for the year.” Battery power? Jonathan Shaw says he’s very interested in getting battery storage for his house, but they’re too expensive right now. “Once the price of batteries comes down we will think about that,” he says. In principle it makes sense: the sun only shines during the day when many people are at work and unable to use all their solar-generated electricity. But if you can put that energy in a battery, then you can use it any time. And the loss of generous feed-in tariffs is driving interest in battery storage, says Chris Cooper, chief executive of Suncrowd, a company using group purchasing power to get cheaper prices for batteries. “It’s a bit of a trigger point for people to look at new technology,” Cooper says. So far Suncrowd has run its first round in Newcastle, and had about 200 homes join together and buy batteries at discount rates. He says lots of the customers who have been approaching Suncrowd have been people coming off the NSW solar bonus scheme. Having a battery added to an existing solar system can significantly increase “solar self-sufficiency”, Cooper says, a measure of how much the customer relies on solar rather than electricity from the grid. “With an appropriately sized battery you can boost it from 20% to about 60 or 70% self-sufficiency,” he says. Cooper says Suncrowd is building an online tool to help people calculate their solar self-sufficiency and have been showing it to people at events they’ve been holding. “People are really motivated by seeing the numbers go up,” he says. “Even at the bulk-buy prices that we get, the return on investment, there’s other ways you could spend your money. But there’s plenty of intrinsic value that might not be reflected in the bill savings that come with the solar self-sufficiency.” According to a report Moyse published this month, at current prices batteries will not save most people any money. And looking at estimates of how the prices will change, they won’t save many people money until at least 2020. If people do get batteries, the most economic type of system will be a medium or large solar system, combined with a small battery. “That will only supplant a small amount of your overall load, but it’s at least being fully utilised,” Moyse says. Get off the gas Moyse says it’s the most important thing people can do to maximise their use of solar generation, especially in warmer places such as NSW. “There’s no point having gas and solar and electricity delivered from the grid,” he says. “You’ve got three fuel sources there. “If you’ve got gas, you’re generally running one of your two main loads – hot water or space heating – on gas. That’s about 70%, for most people, of your energy use. You really need to run one or both of those on electric to be able to soak up all your solar generation.” For water heating, very energy-efficient heaters such as heat pumps, running off solar generation during the day can be very effective. In NSW and South Australia, depending on the size of the solar system, water should be able to be heated on solar generation. When it comes to space heating, there are a number of options. A house can be preheated while the sun is out, so less power is needed to heat it at night. Or there are heat banks which use the solar generation during the day to heat clay, concrete or ceramic, and then release it at night. Efficiency, time and shopping around Running as many appliances during the day when the sun is shining will help use as little from the grid as possible and help use up as much solar generation as possible. Most new appliances have timers on them that will allow them to run when nobody is home. Since the appliances will still be running things at night – lights, the fridge etc – when there’s no solar generation coming from the roof, it will help to buy energy-efficient appliances when it is time to replace them. Shaw says that at least for the next couple of years, he’s not going to change much about what he does. He says under his solar-adorned roof, he’s got efficient LED lighting throughout, has a top-rated energy-efficient fridge and has triple glazing on his windows. Since he works from home, he already runs most of his appliances during the day. He will get a net meter but, other than that, he’s going to continue as usual. “We’ve done our best to have a low-consumption house anyway and we’re not going to be doing anything much different.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/sep/18/australian-homes-among-first-to-get-teslas-powerwall-solar-energy-battery","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-18T03:08:53Z","webTitle":"Australian homes among first to get Tesla's Powerwall solar-energy battery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/18/australian-homes-among-first-to-get-teslas-powerwall-solar-energy-battery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/sep/18/australian-homes-among-first-to-get-teslas-powerwall-solar-energy-battery","fields":{"headline":"Australian homes among first to get Tesla's Powerwall solar-energy battery","bodyText":"Australia will be one of the first countries in the world to get Tesla’s vaunted Powerwall battery storage system, as several other companies scramble to sign up Australia’s growing number of households with solar rooftops. US firm Tesla said that its 7kWH home energy storage units would be available by the end of the year in Australia, ahead of previous predictions it would arrive in 2016. The Powerwall is a unit that sits on an interior wall. It has a lithium-ion battery, used to store energy created by solar panels on the household roof. Tesla, which also makes electric cars, is the most high-profile company in the emerging battery storage industry – an area that is seen as crucial in making intermittent renewable energy such as solar and wind into a reliable accompaniment, or even alternative, to fossil fuel-fired power grids. Canberra-based firm Reposit Power, which enables people to directly buy and sell their stored electricity, has partnered with Tesla for Powerwall’s launch. There are a handful of existing Australian alternatives to the Powerwall, such as Redflow, headed by Simon Hackett, who founded Internode. Hackett also sits on the board of the NBN. “Tesla’s arrival is important because they have such a high profile,” said Prof Anthony Vassallo, a sustainable energy expert at the University of Sydney. “The Tesla product isn’t unique by any stretch, but it’s the Apple brand of the battery storage industry, they have the sex appeal that others don’t. “Solar PV and batteries are such a wonderful combination. Australians have demonstrated they are quite happy to purchase PV systems, Australia has a great solar resource and to have a battery to store that makes a lot of sense. “There are packages of PV and batteries being offered by retailers and, as prices come down, we’ll see a lot more of this. Tesla’s price point in the US – of about US$3,000 ($4,173) – would be competitive here, it will sharpen up the players to make more efficient and higher-performing systems.” Vassallo pointed out that the technology still has some way to improve – a 7kWH system will store little more than an hour’s electricity generated by a typical 5kWH solar system, meaning that some people may have to have several Powerwall, or equivalent, systems on their walls. “I’d be wary of claims that people can go entirely off the grid, but it’s a first step,” he said. “Australia has high electrity prices, and once the price is acceptable I think the take-up will be strong.” There are more than 1.3m households in Australia with rooftop solar, with the number increasing rapidly as the price of PV systems tumble. State-based tariffs have been gradually withdrawn across the country, while the federal government announced in July that it would instruct the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to favour large-scale solar over rooftop solar in its funding decisions. Labor has set a target of Australia generating 50% of its electrity from renewable energy by 2030, although has provided little detail on how this would be achieved. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said the goal was “reckless” as the cost of it has not been quantified. Vassallo said, “Australia could reach that 50% target, it just requires well-designed policies and markets that allow a transition from centralised, large-scale fossil fuels to efficient but variable renewables. “Storage is a key part to make that happen. The beauty of renewables is that once you’ve managed the capital cost, there is no fuel cost. There’s an energy security there you don’t get with fossil fuels.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2015/dec/06/debbie-dooley-tea-party-solar-energy-florida-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-06T13:00:21Z","webTitle":"The Tea Party leader taking a stand for solar energy: 'I will do what's right'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/06/debbie-dooley-tea-party-solar-energy-florida-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/dec/06/debbie-dooley-tea-party-solar-energy-florida-environment","fields":{"headline":"The Tea Party leader taking a stand for solar energy: 'I will do what's right'","bodyText":"Debbie Dooley is a firebrand Republican and an outspoken founding member of the Tea Party. But in a fast-intensifying battle over the future of solar power in Florida, she is not on the side you might expect. Along with a diverse grassroots citizens’ coalition including environmentalists and other left-leaning activists, Dooley is taking on Big Energy and its big-spending conservative backers in an intriguing fight that puts her toe-to-toe with her onetime political allies. She is at the spearhead of a campaign to place an initiative before Florida voters next year that would give consumers the freedom to choose to buy their solar energy from smaller private companies and bypass the mega-bucks utilities. “It’s Florida’s solar eclipse,” says Dooley, who points to statistics she claims are proof that the Sunshine State is trailing the nation in utilising its most plentiful natural resource. If the initiative is successful, Florida would no longer be one of only four states that prohibits so-called third-party power purchase agreements (PPA), which, in basic terms, refer to a consumer allowing a company to install solar panels with no upfront cost, then paying the company for electricity that the panels generate. As things stand, only those who can afford the substantial initial outlay can power up from the sun, a situation Dooley says is unacceptable. With Florida 14th in the country in terms of installed solar capacity, only $63m was spent on new installations statewide in 2014, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. “Let’s remove the barriers, remove the shackles that protect the monopolies and allow consumer choice and freedom,” said Dooley, whose Green Tea coalition of environmentally conscious conservatives is a key component of the Floridians for Solar Choice amalgam. Unsurprisingly, the big public power utilities don’t like the message being pushed by the activists as they tour the state attempting to collect the 683,000 signatures needed by February to get the initiative on November’s ballot. So companies including Florida Power and Light, Duke Energy, Tampa Electric and Gulf Power are among the donors who have ploughed millions of dollars into a rival group, Consumers for Smart Solar, which is promoting its own initiative that would enshrine in the state’s constitution their exclusive right to sell solar power. Their argument is that opening up the industry the way the citizens’ coalition wants would lead to less regulation and extra expense for traditional consumers in “subsidies” for the solar industry. As the duel has become more caustic in recent months, so have the attacks from rightwingers on Dooley, who has driven thousands of miles across Florida with her partner Jason to speak at rallies, lunches and other engagements in support of a new direction for solar power. Some have called her a fake conservative and say she has betrayed her Republican roots. Others have branded her eccentric and dismissed her travels as a solar-powered clown show as she “shills” for the industry. “I don’t worry about the attacks because I understand the political reality, which is they’re afraid of you,” Dooley told the Guardian after a recent speaking engagement before the League of Women Voters of Palm Beach County. “If you’re not being successful, they’re going to ignore you, so I’m really getting under someone’s skin. I have to laugh at that.” Back in 2009, feeling that the Republican party had “lost its way”, Dooley joined up with 21 like-minded supporters to give the Tea Party movement its first organised structure. “I was tired of politics as usual, tired of big money controlling everything,” she said, explaining why she became a director of the Tea Party Patriots. Now, she says, she finds it ironic that much of the criticism comes from rightwing groups who shared her beliefs, including the Koch brothers-funded American Legislative Exchange Council, but which take an opposite stance on clean energy. “True conservatives champion free-market choice, not government-created monopolies that stifle competition.” she said. “Trying to protect monopolies from competition is not free market. You should be bound by your principles and develop your position on issues based on your principles, not who your financial donors are.” The presence of Dooley, a pastor’s daughter from Bogalusa, Louisiana, in the midst of the Florida battle could prove to be a trump card, according to Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “Here in Florida, the political leadership is conservative, so having a voice like Debbie’s and others on the conservative side to be able to stand up for solar is very critical to the success of running this ballot initiative,” he said. Additionally, this is a conflict Dooley has fought and won before. She says the arguments in Florida, and the tactics employed, are similar to those that existed two years ago in Georgia, another red state wrestling with the solar power issue. Despite heavy opposition from the utilities there, and what she says was its $10m “war chest” against the organisation, Dooley’s grassroots coalition won the day, with a third-party solar bill clearing the legislature this April. “If you mentioned solar in Georgia, it was always, ‘No way, no how,’ but we won that fight with people power,” Dooley said. “We couldn’t match them in money, so we built a coalition, we got free media, we got our message out there. It was easier for us to get press coverage because people were amazed you had these conservative groups, Tea Party groups, the Sierra Club, elected officials, all joining forces to oppose this. “We all had different messages, the different groups, but we were working for the same goal. If we agree solar is the way to go, we come together and ignore issues we may disagree on while respecting the right of everyone to believe and advocate for them. But come together and stay focused. There are many different roads into Atlanta, where I live, and you make your choice depending on which direction you’re coming from. What matters is that you end up there.” Even as a little girl, Dooley refused to be put in a box. When her grandfather bought her a dress-up cowgirl costume as a Christmas gift when she was just seven, the self-confessed tomboy complained loudly. “I don’t want that. I don’t want be a cowgirl. I want a cowboy outfit,” Dooley recalls shouting at her relatives. “I was so upset, they took it right back and got me the cowboy outfit. They’d assumed because I was a girl that was what I wanted. But I was not afraid to challenge the norms.” Dooley says her early years following her father’s preachings in Louisiana, Tennessee and Florida helped to shape her political leanings and turned her into the driven character she is today at the age of 57. “I learned at a very early age to speak up and not be taken advantage of. I had no issue doing that,” she said. “My daddy prepared me well: he was strong, not afraid to take a step out, and I get a lot of my traits from him. “I will do what’s right and damn the torpedoes kind of thing. If you know a preacher’s kid, you know they can be rebellious. People have preconceived notions about you and you fight to show it’s not like that. You grow up tough, you grow up to be independent. “Any pastor will tell you, you can have 100 in your congregation and only a portion of them will be happy at any one time. You understand that not everyone will be happy; you just do your best and stand for what’s right.” Dooley, however, insists that taking a stand does not always have to be a politically charged move. “I became a crusader for solar and I’m appealing to conservatives, [but] I believe being good stewards of the environment God gave us should not be a partisan issue,” she says, pointing out that it was the ultra-conservative president Ronald Reagan who championed the 1987 Montreal Protocol that phased out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from aerosols to protect the ozone layer. “I believe in clean energy. I’ve always cared about clean air and a clean environment. I’ve always been like that,” she said. “I have a grandson, Aiden, who is seven. He’ll know I fought for energy choice and freedom, he’ll know I fought for a clean environment for him, so he wouldn’t have a polluted world. I see it is my legacy to him. “Unfortunately, the legacy of some of my fellow Republicans is that they simply denied that we were damaging our environment because they were greedy for economic reasons.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/aug/31/states-powering-ahead-on-climate-targets-despite-federal-inaction-report-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T18:00:08Z","webTitle":"States powering ahead on climate targets despite federal inaction, report shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/31/states-powering-ahead-on-climate-targets-despite-federal-inaction-report-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/aug/31/states-powering-ahead-on-climate-targets-despite-federal-inaction-report-shows","fields":{"headline":"States powering ahead on climate targets despite federal inaction, report shows","bodyText":"Australian states and territories are powering ahead, developing policies that will meet the federal government’s internationally agreed greenhouse gas emission targets, with South Australia, the ACT and Tasmania leading the race. Despite being chastised by the federal government for unilateral action, South Australia is leading the race, with the ACT and Tasmania not far behind, according to a report by the Climate Council. Compared on a series of measures including penetration of renewable energy, the percentage of households with solar, as well as emissions and renewable energy targets, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and New South Wales are at the back of the pack, with Victoria and Queensland in the middle. Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have been rising ever since the Coalition government repealed the carbon tax in 2014. The federal government’s own projections show their policies will cause emissions to continue to rise for decades to come. But in the midst of the ongoing federal policy vacuum, every state and territory besides Western Australia has “gone it alone” and developed strong renewable energy and emissions reduction policies. South Australia leads the country with 47% of its electricity sourced from renewable sources, followed by the ACT at 22%. Tasmania sourced 92% of its electricity from renewable sources, but that was dominated by large-scale hydro electricity. The Northern Territory sourced just 2% of its electricity from renewable sources, sitting behind Western Australia and Queensland at 7%. Victoria sourced 12% from renewables while NSW sat at 17%. Queensland led the country when it comes to solar households, with 32% of homes having solar panels. That just pipped South Australia, which had 31%. While both Western Australia and the Northern Territory scored poorly on most measures, there appeared to be grassroots momentum there for solar rooftops, with the biggest increases in solar penetration over the past year happening in those states. Western Australia jumped almost three percentage points to more than 25% penetration, and the Northern Territory jumped 2.7 percentage points to 11.4% – a figure that was still the lowest in the country. The ACT and Tasmania had the strongest renewable energy targets, with the former aiming to implement a 100% target by 2020 and the latter by 2022. The ACT’s aggressive and bipartisan renewable energy policies delivered the lowest energy costs in the country for consumers. Every state except Western Australia and the Northern Territory had targets to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. Those policies, combined with a surge in grassroots activity and market-driven closure of coal power plants, look set to easily cut Australia’s emissions by more 28% below 2005 levels, as Australia committed to following the Paris Agreement in 2015. That was the conclusion of a report by Frontier Economics earlier in the year, which concluded: “The commonwealth government will receive credit for state renewable policies that contribute to meeting the 2030 emissions target, while admonishing them for any energy security issues that may result. “Every state and territory, with the exception of Western Australia, is taking energy and climate policy into their own hands, with strong renewable energy targets or net zero emissions targets in place,” said Climate Council councillor and energy expert Andrew Stock. “States and territories previously lagging (NT, NSW and WA), are now stepping up the pace, joining the enormous progress we’re seeing across the nation,” he said. Climate Council member and former president of BP Australasia, Greg Bourne, said Australians are embracing solar energy in droves, with more than 5.6GW generated on the rooftops of 1.7 million homes. “Australia is one of the sunniest countries in the world, so it’s no surprise we’ve already rolled out enough solar to power the lights at the MCG every day for 20,000 years,” he said. States leading the way without federal coordination was described as a “a messy dog’s breakfast” by the Grattan Institute’s Tony Wood, who went on to say the unilateral state action was “understandable with federal climate change inaction”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/14/geoengineering-is-not-a-quick-fix-for-climate-change-experts-warn-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Geoengineering is not a quick fix for climate change, experts warn Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/14/geoengineering-is-not-a-quick-fix-for-climate-change-experts-warn-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/14/geoengineering-is-not-a-quick-fix-for-climate-change-experts-warn-trump","fields":{"headline":"Geoengineering is not a quick fix for climate change, experts warn Trump","bodyText":"Leading climate scientists have warned that geoengineering research could be hijacked by climate change deniers as an excuse not to reduce CO2 emissions, citing the US administration under Donald Trump as a major threat to their work. David Keith, a solar geoengineering (GE) expert at Harvard University has said there is a real danger that his work could be exploited by those who oppose action on emissions, at the same time as he defended himself and colleagues from the claims GE strengthens the argument for abandoning the targets set by the Paris climate agreement. “One of the main concerns I and everyone involved in this have, is that Trump might tweet ‘geoengineering solves everything – we don’t have to bother about emissions.’ That would break the slow-moving agreement among many environmental groups that sound research in this field makes sense,” Keith said on the sidelines of the Climate Engineering Conference (CEC) in Berlin. Indeed, utterances from people in or close to the Trump administration – most notably GE proponent secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who has referred to climate change as “just an engineering problem” – make it clear they either tacitly or directly support the idea of climate engineering. Earlier this year, Keith, a professor of applied physics at Harvard announced plans to conduct an outdoor trial into stratospheric aerosol injection, involving launching a high-altitude balloon that will spray a small quantity of reflective particles into the stratosphere. Keith believes the experiment may help to measure the feasibility and risks involved in GE, an umbrella term for a range of techniques to deliberately adjust the climate in an effort to mitigate global warming. They include reflecting sunlight from space, adding huge quantities of lime or iron to the oceans, pumping deep cold nutrient-rich waters to the surface of oceans and irrigating vast swaths of desert to grow trees. Supporters of research into geoengineering argue that its techniques – roughly-speaking divided into carbon dioxide removal (CDR, or negative emission technologies) which removes greenhouse gases, and solar-radiation management (SRM or solar geoengineering) which reduces the amount of solar energy warming the planet – could help to lessen some of the consequences of climate change. However, the common consensus is that the techniques should be used in addition to reductions in CO2 emissions. This week’s conference drew attention to the huge risks involved. “All the techniques being proposed have potentially severe environmental impacts,” said Silvia Ribeiro of the ETC Group, leading campaign monitors of new technologies and their possible impact on the world’s poorest. “They also ignore the question as to why there’s not enough political will to have done more to tackle climate change until now and they in turn serve to justify the inaction,” she added. Concerns focus on techniques such as stratospheric aerosol injection, which some experts say has the potential to reduce the amount of rain from Asian and African monsoons and could have a devastating impact on the food supply of billions of people. Aerosol injection also has the potential to reduce the ozone layer and heighten the risk of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Other possible side effects of GE may be an increase in ocean acidification, a change in weather patterns, a rapid rise in temperatures, and a huge uptake in the use of agricultural land, all of which could prompt mass migration of millions of climate change refugees. But scientists such as Keith, and Mark Lawrence, scientific director of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) in Potsdam, argue that with the Paris agreement goals to limit temperature rise to two degrees or less, almost impossible to achieve, the world has little choice than to thoroughly explore technical intervention and the potential it has to avoid global disaster. “It will be very difficult to achieve the Paris agreement calls without some form of climate engineering,” Lawrence said. “It’s not impossible, but it’s hard to imagine we would make the major changes in our infrastructure and lifestyles in the time necessary.” Keith also dismissed the view that climate engineers like himself were on a mission to prove that climate engineering worked at all costs, or else see the importance of decades of their life’s work evaporate. “At the best climate engineering is a supplement, and it could be that we shouldn’t do it,” he insisted. “Our work is to inform better choices and it would actually be very useful to know for sure it didn’t work. Right now there are heads of state and others in leadership who are explicitly assuming it could work, that it’s there if we need it. But let’s say we found something deep in the climate models which suggested we were overoptimistic about solar geoengineering, then I would say ‘abandon it’. That would be great. I’d love to publish that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/26/offshore-wind-power-energy-price-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T09:50:30Z","webTitle":"Wind power is now cheaper than nuclear – the energy revolution is happening | John Sauven \r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/offshore-wind-power-energy-price-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/offshore-wind-power-energy-price-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Wind power is now cheaper than nuclear – the energy revolution is happening","bodyText":"In March I went to see Henrik Poulsen, the boss of Dong Energy, in Copenhagen. Never heard of him or his company? You are not alone, but the chances are he is keeping your lights on. The largely unknown story of his company is worth telling because it is genuinely revolutionary. Dong stands for Danish oil and natural gas. It was, like Shell and BP, involved in fossil fuel exploration and production. But in less than a decade it has become an 85% offshore wind company, and is divesting its coal, oil and gas interests. By 2023, Dong Energy will be very close to zero carbon. That is a pretty staggering transformation in a very short space of time. But it doesn’t end there. This isn’t just a hymn to the glory of an oil and gas company, it’s also a paean to the UK’s “greenest government ever”. Thanks to its support, the price of offshore wind energy has dropped by half in less than two years. By the 2020s, it will be as cheap or cheaper than any other form of power generation. It’s just become much cheaper than nuclear, even taking into account the additional costs associated with the wind’s intermittency. And in any case, this is less of an issue at sea where the winds are more constant. Talking to Poulsen made me realise that we were on the cusp of a quiet revolution. From being the most expensive form of renewable energy, offshore wind was fast becoming the cheapest form of large-scale, low-carbon generation bar none. As Poulsen said: “When you go 10 years into the future and you look back, I think we will look at these years, 2016, 2017, 2018, as the inflection point. I think we’ll look back and say wow … Something happened for wind and solar energy during those years that completely changed the dynamic.” But he also said that “without the UK government and what they have done for the past five or six years, we wouldn’t have been where we are today. I’m glad to see that it’s paying off because we’re creating a lot of jobs right now and building a local supply chain. So they’ll get their rewards, which they should.” There’s a pleasing symmetry in fighting climate change, a truly enormous problem that remains invisible to most people in the UK, with offshore wind, an equivalently huge and equally invisible solution. But I came away from that meeting thinking that this quiet revolution needed a bit of noise and visibility. Amid the gale of bad news that has blown through 2017, this was a good news story that needed shouting about from the rooftops. This month’s contracts for the next round of offshore wind farms to be built in the North Sea should have the champagne corks popping in No 10. They mean billions more in foreign investment coming into the UK. They will be playing a major role in regenerating regions in the north-east of the country. And they will create a thriving export market in contracts for offshore wind developments. But we at Greenpeace are not sure the government has noticed the full potential that their policies have created. To bring it to their attention, some of the world’s biggest players, including Vattenfall and General Electric, have come together alongside environmental organisations including WWF and the Marine Conservation Society. A campaign is being launched today at Westminster with the help of creative agency Mother, which is working pro bono. They explained to us that when you’re selling the future of energy generation at 50% off, all you really need to do is get this fact in front of your customers. MPs using Westminster tube station will find it hard to miss. The UK needs affordable and secure energy. We have to replace our obsolete power stations and meet growing demand from the electric vehicle revolution. Offshore wind, alongside a smart energy system including storage and interconnectors, should be the backbone of how the UK generates its power in future. Short term, as part of the transition, gas back up might be required (but only when needed, unless it’s green like biogas). Such a system could help us meet our climate change commitments and speed up the move to a low-carbon economy. It could provide jobs and regional regeneration as well as provide export markets. It could be the cheapest form of large-scale power available. It’s shown to be wildly popular in all opinion surveys. We urge the government to come clean on this issue and publicly admit that they got this right! • John Sauven is director of Greenpeace"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2017/aug/13/mercedes-e-class-350d-amg-review-the-car-makers-really-cared","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-13T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Mercedes E-Class 350d AMG review: ‘The car makers really cared’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/13/mercedes-e-class-350d-amg-review-the-car-makers-really-cared","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/aug/13/mercedes-e-class-350d-amg-review-the-car-makers-really-cared","fields":{"headline":"Mercedes E-Class 350d AMG review: ‘The car makers really cared’","bodyText":"Price: £49,355 Top speed: 155mph 0-62mph: 5.9 seconds MPG: 54.3 CO2: 144g/km In my last Tour de France on day-to-day reporting duty for the Observer and Guardian, after 27 years on the job, I acquired a new interest in statistics. It is probably a good job that the Mercedes E-Class 350d AMG, which was this year’s Tour car, was the first I’d had with an onboard computer to deliver the brutal truth about the hours spent at the wheel, or I might have called time sooner. At the end of this year’s 28 days on the road I’d clocked up 4,800 miles and 112 hours’ driving. In other words, 28 hours per week. More than an entire day in every seven sitting in the same place: the driver’s seat of the car. It’s a rude awakening for many when I explain that covering the Tour comes down to a handy, if unromantic French rhyme: auto, boulot, dodo – car, work, sleep – and that disturbing stat confirmed what my instinct, and sore posterior, has told me in the past. Last year, I described how modern car-seat technology had made the Tour less of a pain in the rear end. Mercédès – I like to give Tour cars a name and figured if that was good enough for Alexandre Dumas it was fine for me and the voiture – had enough electronic ways of manipulating the seat to ensure a different position on each of the 28 days, though I never quite figured out how to make it provide a massage as the car manual seemed to promise it might (too busy putting in the hours at the wheel to do the reading). There were other stats to scroll through in the many hours spent watching the autoroute whizz towards me (€200 in tolls along the way). For those 4,800 miles, we managed 48 miles per gallon, not unreasonable given the amount of mountain driving using the Sport setting. On one stage out of the mountains (Salon de Provence), on the Eco setting which tells the car to coast on any downhill, it hit 52mpg. Not surprisingly though, Mercédès felt most at home on the autobahn of her native Germany, where the Tour began. There was much technology: my favourite was the delightfully gentle reading light, which was bright enough but far from dazzling, making you feel like the car makers really cared; my least-loved was the slightly bewildering five levers on the steering column. In Provence (fortunately in an entirely private parking lot) I discovered the flipside of the key-less ignition, however: if totally knackered and work-absorbed, you can leave the extremely quiet (and happily very economical) engine running for four hours, while typing obliviously 150 yards away. On Tour, the more thought processes are taken away from you, the more grateful you feel. I was thankful indeed. This year’s revelation was Active Distance Assist, basically the car slowing automatically in cruise control when it thinks something might be getting in the way. Much of the Tour day boiled down to: turn on the autoroute, engage cruise, point and trust, in which you feel like a pilot trying fly by wire for the first time. Plus, a tie-in with the satnav told it to slow down when the speed limit changed. The main lesson of 26 Tours in 26 very different cars? Few objects absorb as much solar energy as a vehicle parked outside a Tour press centre. That brain melting heat should be harnessed in ways other than merely baking the contents before you put the aircon on. Not even Mercédès had an answer to this one, although given the ingenuity on display throughout the 350 I’m sure it’s only a matter of time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/24/i-will-return-saudi-arabia-moderate-islam-crown-prince","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T18:24:46Z","webTitle":"I will return Saudi Arabia to moderate Islam, says crown prince","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/24/i-will-return-saudi-arabia-moderate-islam-crown-prince","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/24/i-will-return-saudi-arabia-moderate-islam-crown-prince","fields":{"headline":"I will return Saudi Arabia to moderate Islam, says crown prince","bodyText":"Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has vowed to return the country to “moderate Islam” and asked for global support to transform the hardline kingdom into an open society that empowers citizens and lures investors. In an interview with the Guardian, the powerful heir to the Saudi throne said the ultra-conservative state had been “not normal” for the past 30 years, blaming rigid doctrines that have governed society in a reaction to the Iranian revolution, which successive leaders “didn’t know how to deal with”. Expanding on comments he made at an investment conference at which he announced the launch of an ambitious $500bn (£381bn) independent economic zone straddling Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt, Prince Mohammed said: “We are a G20 country. One of the biggest world economies. We’re in the middle of three continents. Changing Saudi Arabia for the better means helping the region and changing the world. So this is what we are trying to do here. And we hope we get support from everyone. “What happened in the last 30 years is not Saudi Arabia. What happened in the region in the last 30 years is not the Middle East. After the Iranian revolution in 1979, people wanted to copy this model in different countries, one of them is Saudi Arabia. We didn’t know how to deal with it. And the problem spread all over the world. Now is the time to get rid of it.” Earlier Prince Mohammed had said: “We are simply reverting to what we followed – a moderate Islam open to the world and all religions. 70% of the Saudis are younger than 30, honestly we won’t waste 30 years of our life combating extremist thoughts, we will destroy them now and immediately.” The crown prince’s comments are the most emphatic he has made during a six-month reform programme that has tabled cultural reforms and economic incentives unimaginable during recent decades, during which the kingdom has been accused of promoting a brand of Islam that underwrote extremism. The comments were made as the heir of the incumbent monarch moves to consolidate his authority, sidelining clerics whom he believes have failed to support him and demanding unquestioning loyalty from senior officials whom he has entrusted to drive a 15-year reform programme that aims to overhaul most aspects of life in Saudi Arabia. Central to the reforms has been the breaking of an alliance between hardline clerics who have long defined the national character and the House of Saud, which has run affairs of state. The changes have tackled head-on societal taboos such as the recently rescinded ban on women driving, as well as scaling back guardianship laws that restrict women’s roles and establishing an Islamic centre tasked with certifying the sayings of the prophet Muhammed. The scale and scope of the reforms has been unprecedented in the country’s modern history and concerns remain that a deeply conservative base will oppose what is effectively a cultural revolution – and that the kingdom lacks the capacity to follow through on its economic ambitions. The new economic zone is to be established on 470km of the Red Sea coast, in a tourist area that has already been earmarked as a liberal hub akin to Dubai, where male and female bathers are free to mingle. It has been unveiled as the centrepiece of efforts to turn the kingdom away from a near total dependence on oil and into a diverse open economy. Obstacles remain: an entrenched poor work ethic, a crippling regulatory environment and a general reluctance to change. “Economic transformation is important but equally essential is social transformation,” said one of the country’s leading businessmen. “You cannot achieve one without the other. The speed of social transformation is key. It has to be manageable.” Alcohol, cinemas and theatres are still banned in the kingdom and mingling between unrelated men and women remains frowned upon. However Saudi Arabia – an absolute monarchy – has clipped the wings of the once-feared religious police, who no longer have powers to arrest and are seen to be falling in line with the new regime. Economically Saudi Arabia will need huge resources if it is to succeed in putting its economy on a new footing and its leadership believes it will fail to generate strategic investments if it does not also table broad social reforms. Prince Mohammed had repeatedly insisted that without establishing a new social contract between citizen and state, economic rehabilitation would fail. “This is about giving kids a social life,” said a senior Saudi royal figure. “Entertainment needs to be an option for them. They are bored and resentful. A woman needs to be able to drive herself to work. Without that we are all doomed. Everyone knows that – except the people in small towns. But they will learn.” In the next 10 years, at least five million Saudis are likely to enter the country’s workforce, posing a huge problem for officials who currently do not have jobs to offer them or tangible plans to generate employment. The economic zone is due to be completed by 2025 – five years before the current cap on the reform programme – and is to be powered by wind and solar energy, according to its founders. The country’s enormous sovereign wealth fund is intended to be a key backer of the independent zone. It currently has $230bn under management. The sale of 5% of the world’s largest company, Aramco, is expected to raise several hundred billion dollars more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/apr/03/climate-change-water-fossil-fuel","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-03T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"There’s another story to tell about climate change.

And it starts with water","bodyText":"It’s easy for all concerned about air, water and nature to descend into despair as we watch brazen rollbacks of environmental legislation in the US. Just last week, developments included an executive order to rewrite US carbon emissions rules, jeopardising the country’s ability to uphold its Paris climate talk commitment; the end of a moratorium on new coal leases; and the green-lighting of a pesticide claimed to cause harm to children. But as apathy is not an option, let’s try to think beyond the usual strategies. For one, we can recognise that the way we talk about our environmental challenges has interfered with our ability to truly grapple with them: that we limit ourselves by creating too simple a story. Specifically, the story we tell about climate. Now I’m not speaking of climate-change denial. For at this juncture, with wild temperature swings and record-breaking weather becoming the norm, outright denial amounts to a kind of temper tantrum, a primitive railing against the inconvenience and indignity of elemental change. Rather, I mean the way that we understand climate change, the story we tell ourselves. In a popular TED talk, Nigerian-born author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie introduced the concept of the “single story”: the tendency to uncritically embrace received wisdom. While she referenced social and ethnic narratives, the “single story”, and its inherent risks of limiting perspective, applies to other beliefs as well. By shifting to a more complex, multifaceted story we can envision solutions that better reflect the realities of climate and how the natural world processes heat. Our characterisation of climate change – the “single story” – is this: “Climate change is global warming caused by too much CO2 in the atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels. We stop climate change by making the transition to renewable energy.” This is certainly a key aspect of the story, and we absolutely need to shift away from fossil fuels … like, 20 years ago. But there are several problems with this narrative. One is the uncomfortable fact that even if, by some miracle, we could immediately cut emissions to zero, due to inertia in the system it would take more than a century for CO2 levels to drop to 350 parts per million, which is considered the safe threshold. Plus, here’s what we don’t talk about when we talk about climate: we can all go solar and drive electric cars and still have the problems – the unprecedented heat waves, the wacky weather – that we now associate with CO2-driven climate change. Climate is not a function of one sole metric; it is not a single story. And this is where we find opportunities. When faced with an environmental predicament, it can be useful to inquire as to how nature has approached similar scenarios. For instance, in the case of wildfire, one can ask what processes used to keep that landscape hydrated and therefore resilient to fire. We learn that in the American west, beavers created wetlands and acted as “shock absorbers” that minimised fire risks. And when we ask what maintains our climate, the answer is water. Were it not for the blanket of water vapour that buffers the Earth, our planet would be too cold to inhabit. The phase changes of water – from solid to liquid to gas, and back – represent an extraordinary transfer of heat. According to Australian microbiologist Walter Jehne, water-based processes in the atmosphere and the oceans, over land and across ice, govern some 95% of Earth’s natural heat dynamics. It is the sheer immensity of water’s role in climate that led scientists to conclude that humans could not have interfered with it. And yet, once we understand how water works – and how water intersects with factors we can influence, such as land use and plant cover – we can help to restore the processes that sustain the heat and energy balance, and therefore sustain our climate. Water doesn’t move and transfigure on its own: much of its movement is determined by biology, particularly by plants. Consider transpiration, in which plants draw up water and release it as vapour. This is a cooling mechanism, as it consumes and dissipates heat from the sun. According to Czech botanist Jan Pokorný, on a sunny day a good-sized tree may transpire more than 100 litres (21 gallons) of water – a process that represents three times the cooling power of an airconditioning system in a five-star hotel room. Brazilian scientist Antonio Donato Nobre says that collectively, the trees of the Amazon rainforest create a “vertical river” even greater than the Amazon river itself. This is moisture in motion, embodying and conveying heat. The “single story” has been that climate change will affect the availability of water. The more complex – and complete – story is that water can also have an effect on climate. And that this is activated by plants. Peter Andrews, a farmer and author in Australia, made a statement that has stuck with me: “Plants manage water. And in managing water, they manage heat.” Worth noting: we have de-vegetated a quarter of the planet – including destroying most of our natural forests. When we talk about “energy”, certainly in terms of policy, we usually mean what fuels our cars and heats our homes. Let’s look at energy in a very basic sense, as in what happens when sunlight meets the ground. Say you have pavement, or land marked by degraded, exposed soil – the condition of much of the world’s surface. When the sun beams down on that bare soil, solar energy is absorbed; it becomes sensible heat, or heat you can feel. Now amble over to a nice meadow, or well-managed rangeland with a thick carpet of grasses. Here solar energy touches down on plants that are transpiring. The solar heat is dispersed and becomes latent heat, embodied in water vapour, to be condensed and released as rain. There is nothing magic about any of this: throughout human history – the climatically benign period known as the Holocene – climate moderation has derived from functioning ecosystems. The important thing to realise is that we can restore ecosystems, these environments that have nurtured and sustained us, and bring heat and water dynamics back into balance. Because natural processes are so entwined, every step toward regeneration brings multiple co-benefits: more plants mean more photosynthesis, which means more carbon pulled from the atmosphere into the soil, where it adds fertility; every 1% increase in soil organic carbon represents an additional 250,000 litres per hectare that can be held on the land; the more water held on the land, the greater resilience to floods and drought. Here’s another climate subplot worth mulling over: Walter Jehne points out that based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, every square metre of Earth’s surface receives an average of 342 watts of solar energy a day. Because of how humans have altered the environment, we now radiate back about 339 watts per square metre – a difference of less than 1%. If we managed our ecology better, how might we make up that three-watt differential? How about if we had a lot more plant cover and a lot less bare ground? One challenge to reckoning with climate change is that despite all the weather anomalies we’ve been seeing, it’s difficult to confidently link climate change to any one event. This perpetuates the notion that climate change is an abstraction to be pushed off into the future, and leads to cognitive dissonance in that it seems impossible to “prove” what we know to be so. Let me now introduce an alternate definition of climate change: “manifestations of distorted carbon, water and energy cycles”. That doesn’t negate the single story of fossil fuel-borne carbon but broadens it in a way that creates opportunities beyond fighting fossil fuel interests. At this moment of reckless distraction and denial, it is crucial to find meaningful paths forward."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/jun/02/anglican-church-queensland-carmichael-mine-heartland-divest-fossil-fuels-australia-adani","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-01T20:12:18Z","webTitle":"Anglican church in Carmichael mine heartland to divest from fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/02/anglican-church-queensland-carmichael-mine-heartland-divest-fossil-fuels-australia-adani","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jun/02/anglican-church-queensland-carmichael-mine-heartland-divest-fossil-fuels-australia-adani","fields":{"headline":"Anglican church in Carmichael mine heartland to divest from fossil fuels","bodyText":"The Anglican church in Australia’s largest coalmining region, including the site of Adani’s proposed Carmichael mine, has vowed to renounce interests in fossil fuels. The Anglican diocese of Rockhampton, which includes central Queensland mining and gas towns across 20 parishes – the largest of which is bigger than Victoria – voted to divest from the likes of thermal coal and coal seam gas at a synod meeting on 20 May. A group of about 70 priests and church representatives passed two motions committing the church to ethical investments, a criteria which puts fossil fuels in the same category as arms dealing, tobacco, alcohol and gambling, wage exploitation and pornography. That position likely leaves scope to retain interests in coking coal for steel but focuses on renewables for energy investments. Lindsay Howie, the dean of St Paul’s cathedral in Rockhampton, said the diocese’s investments were “pretty much bugger all compared to the rest of the world”. “Nevertheless, we’re encouraging Christians to exercise responsibility in terms of where they put their investments and to think seriously about wind energy and solar energy,” he said. “That’s where we’d like it to be going.” The Rockhampton diocese, which takes in Gladstone, Moranbah and Clermont – the closest town to Adani’s proposed site for Australia’s largest coalmine in the Galilee Basin – includes a population of about 48,000 people who identify as Anglican. The motion called for scrapping investments in companies “significantly involved in or deriving more than 25% of their annual income” from “polluting the atmosphere, soil or water resources [or] the production or use of fossil fuels”. It also renounces investments in armaments, gambling, tobacco, liquor, x-rated imagery and industries that unfairly exploit employees or the disadvantaged. Howie said the motions were “very broad but really it’s about exercising social responsibility”. He said “one of the great areas of concern” locally was that mining development of the Galilee Basin represented the permanent scarification of “some of the most beautiful and productive agricultural land we have in Queensland”. “That’s to say nothing of the Indigenous perspective in terms of the sacredness of that particular land,” Howie said. “If you’ve been into Moura, Moranbah, Dysart, there are huge spoil heaps, the overburden, sitting slap-bang on what used to be incredibly productive land. “One of the problems with it now is they’ve tried to do the reclamation and, try as they might, it’ll take a million years for that land to ever be productive again because it’s full of heavy minerals and metals and acids. “What we’re going to end up with in terms of the whole Galilee Basin is a scar from Rolleston to Springsure, 100km wide, for about 500 to 600km. “It’s just a staggering invasion of some of the most productive agricultural land in Queensland.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/may/30/outsourcing-it-poses-risks-in-britain-and-in-india","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T18:31:41Z","webTitle":"Outsourcing IT poses risks in Britain and in India | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/30/outsourcing-it-poses-risks-in-britain-and-in-india","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/may/30/outsourcing-it-poses-risks-in-britain-and-in-india","fields":{"headline":"Outsourcing IT poses risks in Britain and in India","bodyText":"British Airways and many other businesses have offshored electricity-dependent functions like IT services and call centres to northern India (BA chief refuses to resign after ‘catastrophic’ IT failure, 30 May). Increasingly this is a region in the grip of extended droughts and annual heatwaves associated with record-breaking temperatures that scientists say will only get worse with climate change. Catastrophic electricity system failures are exacerbated by heat-triggered thunderstorms and regional outages resulting from the air-conditioning-related energy demand spikes that are common in India. In July 2012 power failed for 600 million people in northern India in the biggest blackout in history. It is rather surprising that business continuity planners allow their clients to relocate energy and water-hungry operations to such climate-challenged regions. British Airways’ Indian HQ is located in a tall glass tower with no opening windows in the New Delhi satellite city of Gurgaon. Once the limited backup power supplies are exhausted in such buildings they have to be evacuated. One simple solution is to design buildings very differently with sensibly sized and shaded opening windows, powered by solar energy. Another is to onshore electricity-hungry operations back to cooler Britain. I expect the business continuity community are re-evaluating their “future-proofing” strategies as I write.

Norway's fossil-free energy startups","bodyText":"Øyvind Christian Rohn spent more than two decades in the oil and gas industry. But the 50-year-old from Skedsmo, near Oslo in Norway, has just set out on a new fossil-free career path: developing offshore solar power technology. An alternative energy startup Ocean Sun, that he co-founded, has developed technology that will mean solar farms can float on the ocean surface, with their power transmitted back to land. Since physical space is limited in population centres, especially in areas of high growth such as South East Asia, its idea is to use the ocean’s surface around the world. With a grant from Innovation Norway, a state-funded organisation supporting the development of Norwegian industry, the company is aiming to get a product to market within four years. Rohn is one of a new brand of Norwegian entrepreneurs moving from oil to green energy in light of the oil-price decline and more pessimistic outlook for the sector. Though still tiny at less than 1% of Norway’s power generation, according to the agency Multiconsult, the country’s solar sector is growing fast. Solar panel installation grew by 366% in 2016. “We see solar becoming the long-term solution for the world because it is abundant energy and costs have gone down rapidly,” says Rohn. Wake-up call Norway already produces a lot of renewable energy – 97% of electricity generated in the country comes from renewable sources, mainly hydropower, according to Innovation Norway. But when it comes to the economy, petrochemicals are still king: about half of Norway’s exports relate to oil and gas. The decline in revenues from crude oil – which dropped by more than 30% between 2014 and 2015, according to Norway’s statistics agency – was therefore a wake-up call, says Sigridur Thormodsdottir, a sustainability expert at Innovation Norway. “It revealed our economy was not sustainable in the long run. New technology supporting more sustainable urbanisation is one area we think can become an export for Norwegian companies.” The government clearly agrees. Since 2014, it has launched a number of “clusters” promoting startup innovation, including a new solar energy cluster, launched last year with three years of funding. Young start-ups, who have joined the clusters of companies and agencies working together, include wave power firm Tidetec, hydrogen technology firm Hynor Lillestrøm, solar powered-devices company Kyoto Energy and DeepRiver, which aims to generate hydropower from rivers. Major fossil fuel companies are also investing in renewables. Statoil, for example, established as the Norwegian State Oil Company is testing floating wind turbines technology off the country’s coast. Mali Skoden is director of the Oslo Renewable Energy and Environment Cluster (OREEC), a similar networking initiative to the government clusters, created with regional companies and other partners. She says lower oil prices and awareness of climate change are providing opportunities. “Much of our economy depends on the oil and gas industry, which is declining. A lot of engineers and bright minds from that industry are looking for jobs so we can channel that brain power into new sectors of green energy.” As part of this, solar is getting a lot of attention, says Trine Kopstad Berentsen, chief executive of the solar energy cluster in Norway. The municipal council in Oslo is offering individual householders a subsidy of 30% of the investment for solar panel installation, for example, she says. Culture change Cost is not the only obstacle, however, adds Berentsen: “The biggest challenge for Norway ... is conservatism in the energy sector.” This is echoed by Glen Peters, senior researcher at the Oslo-based Centre for International Climate Research, who says that not everyone wants to pivot to greener power. “Oil and gas has made Norway what it is, a lot of people have worked [in the sector] directly and indirectly, and it’s almost part of the culture. It’s hard to lift out and see other opportunities,” he says. Rohn believes that Norway’s renewables sector will coexist with petrochemicals for the foreseeable future. “I haven’t had any negative feedback. People think it’s quite brave, of course, to start up something from scratch after having worked for such big organisations before but generally there’s no conflict. “People who work in oil and gas think their contribution will be to make sure that they develop oil and gas in the best possible way to minimise environmental change, and that they can do that better here in Norway,” he says. “I believe we have to change.” Sign up to be a Guardian Sustainable Business member and get more stories like this direct to your inbox every week.

The entire Dodecanese island is a nature reserve, with more than 150 species of resident and migratory birds, over 650 plant varieties, and a permanent population hovering around 500. Tilos owes its extraordinary biodiversity to a network of underground springs that feed five wetlands – but also to the late mayor, Tassos Aliferis, a committed environmentalist who earned Tilos its reputation as “Greece’s green island”. Aliferis banned hunting in 1993. (He also conducted the first same-sex marriages in Greece in 2008 long before they became legal in 2015.) The current mayor, Maria Kamma, continues to champion sustainable development, and human rights. She has extended an open invitation to refugee families to settle on Tilos, working with the NGO SolidarityNow and the UNHCR to establish sheltered accommodation, language classes and mentoring schemes to help asylum-seekers set up organic farming businesses in partnership with locals. “We want to revive traditions that were dying out due to a dwindling population, like making cheese and gathering medicinal herbs,” says Kamma. “By integrating refugees, we can boost the local economy and encourage eco-tourism.” Soon Tilos could become even greener: it’s set to be the first island in the Mediterranean powered by wind and solar energy. The island currently relies on oil-based electricity from neighbouring Kos, via a submarine cable that is vulnerable to faults. Power cuts are frequent. By installing a single wind turbine and small photovoltaic park, Tilos is creating a hybrid micro-grid that will generate and store energy. Installation is under way and an 18-month pilot begins in September, as part of a €15m project largely funded by the European commission. Eventually, Tilos could export excess power to Kos, and the goal is to roll out similar projects on other small islands in Europe. Financial support has also been provided for Tilos Park, a non-profit residents’ association set up to protect and promote the island’s natural and cultural heritage, and upgrade the Information Centre, where visitors can pick up maps of nature trails, mountain bike routes, and the best spots for sighting rare birds, or sign up for canoe and kayak trips. It’s hoped that knock-on effects will include increased visitor numbers – which currently stand at 13,000 per year – particularly among eco-minded travellers. “Tilos has many loyal ‘fans’ who’ve come every year for 30 years,” says Kamma. “Now we’re getting a lot more interest from young people who have heard about Tilos because of the renewable energy project. They like what we are doing and want to support the island.” Kamma also hopes the positive publicity will help generate additional funding to install solar-powered street lighting, introduce electric bicycles and motorbikes for municipal staff, and charging stations for electric cars. “Usually it’s hard for a tiny island community to break with tradition, but on Tilos we’ve always welcomed alternatives,” she says. “If we can do it, anyone can.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2015/jul/28/is-hillary-clintons-ambitious-solar-energy-goal-for-the-us-workable","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-28T13:03:32Z","webTitle":"Is Hillary Clinton's ambitious solar energy goal for the US workable? | Karl Mathiesen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/28/is-hillary-clintons-ambitious-solar-energy-goal-for-the-us-workable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jul/28/is-hillary-clintons-ambitious-solar-energy-goal-for-the-us-workable","fields":{"headline":"Is Hillary Clinton's ambitious solar energy goal for the US workable?","bodyText":"On Sunday, Hillary Clinton took a first swing at the many-headed carbon hydra. By the end of her first term, she said, the US would have seven times more solar energy capacity than it does today. And by 2027, renewable energy would supply a third of the nation’s electricity. Clinton’s announcement, which the campaign said would be the first of many on climate change from the presidential hopeful, extends the carbon-saving ambition in a significant sector of the economy. Burning fossil fuels for electricity accounts for 31% of US greenhouse gas emissions. One estimate found Clinton’s 33% renewable target could slice another 4% off the US’s existing pledge to cut emissions by 26-28% by 2025. Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Americas chief, Ethan Zindler, said the ambition was high, but within reach. “It appears to be on the upper end but it’s entirely doable given the rapidly improving economics of renewables generally and solar particularly.” The momentum is already swinging towards low carbon electricity. Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, due for activation in August, is predicted to push the renewable sector from its current 13% share of the electricity market to 25% by 2027. In 2015, solar photovoltaic installations are forecast to rise by 27%, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). This rise has been aided by the soon-to-expire solar investment tax credit (ITC), which the industry said Clinton will have to revive. “Clinton’s ambitious goal for solar is only possible if solar continues its impressive trajectory. SEIA is working to extend the solar ITC and remove statewide barriers that inhibit the growth of solar,” said SEIA president and CEO, Rhone Resch. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Clinton noted that further federal investment would be needed to incentivise the sector’s push to 33%. In a fact sheet, the campaign flagged the resuscitation of tax credits and some innovation and regulatory incentives. “That [the return of tax credits] is hardly a sure thing, given that at least one chamber of Congress will inevitably be Republican controlled during at least the first two years of any new president’s term,” said Zindler. Jürgen Weiss, head of climate change at the Brattle Group consultancy, said incentives were important as the industry remained relatively tiny, with low public awareness. A large percentage of costs for installers of residential solar are wrapped up in selling the technology to a sceptical public who have relatively low electricity costs and little concern for climate change. “The big part is convincing people to sign up in the first place. People in the US may care less about climate change than they do about cost,” he said. Although the technology, regulatory and labour costs are roughly similar, the price of installing residential solar in Germany (where high electricity costs, strong public acceptance and large government incentives have driven a huge push to solar) is around $1.50 (£1) per watt cheaper than in the US. Even if half of Clinton’s target of 140GW of solar by 2021 were to come from residential (as opposed to utility) solar panels, that equates to a cost difference of more than $100bn, mostly spent on advertising and sales. John Reilly, an energy economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the targets would be a challenge “in terms of providing incentives to build that much”. Weiss said: “I do think those costs will come down as the market matures and people get more informed.” The danger, he said, was providing too much tax-payer funded incentive early on. In Germany and the UK, the solar industry has come under political pressure for being too successful when subsidies were high and now suffers from accusations of being a ‘subsidy junky’. It’s important to clear up some ambiguity in the Clinton rhetoric. From her renewables campaign video, “a 10-year goal of generating enough renewable energy to power every single home in America” does not mean every home is going to have its own clean energy supply. The residential sector uses roughly a third of the total electricity generated. So a 33% renewable goal means the country will be generating this much clean energy, but not all of it will end up in homes. But factories and office buildings don’t vote and the promise, as my colleague Suzanne Goldenberg points out, allows Clinton to sound like she’s liberating bill payers from utilities. It is also clear that Clinton’s focus on solar (as opposed to wind) is aimed at the voting bill payer. Solar even garners support among some Republicans because of the freedom it offers from regulation and bills. But the other side of the clean power revolution might be justified in feeling a little left out by Clinton’s policy announcement. Wind energy is by far the big brother to solar. In 2014, wind generated 4.4% of the country’s electricity compared with 0.4% from the sun. In Iowa, where Clinton made her announcement, wind’s share is more than a quarter. It’s cheaper than solar, although the gap is narrowing, and the nation’s first offshore wind farm began construction on Monday. “Recent cost declines have made wind energy the lowest-cost zero carbon solution, and one of the lowest cost generation options overall. As a result ... wind will account for the majority of all generation additions going forward,” said the American Wind Energy Association’s Rob Gramlich. The Department of Energy has found that wind energy can affordably reach 20% of electricity generation by 2030. And, under Obama’s Clean Power Plan, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts it will be the biggest contributor of new renewable capacity throughout the 2020s. As part of her announcement, Clinton pledged to uphold the Obama administration’s heavily-opposed restrictions on the carbon emissions of power stations, which are expected to accelerate the already rapid shut-down of coal plants across the country. This capacity will mostly be taken up by cheap gas, but there will be space for renewables if they can compete. Alex Trembath, a senior analyst at the Breakthrough Institute, said: “Action on carbon emissions will largely come by making clean energy cheap, as opposed to making dirty energy more expensive, for a variety of reasons.” The boost to renewables raises important questions about the ability of the grid, which is built to carry power from continuously-burning large power stations rather than millions of diffuse and variable solar panels, to handle such high levels of variable electricity supply. Reilly said the 33% target was achievable. “If we did build that much, then in terms of the grid we would likely have a lot of spare capacity sitting around, so it would be possible to balance it out. The challenge as time goes by and that capacity retires is whether the back-up capacity is actually built,” he said. But Weiss said the likely reality of a renewables explosion would not be uniform: “Average 33% across the country is a different story from having a 70% renewable share in some places and a 10% renewable share someplace else.” Going beyond 33% is when things get really tough for the grid. A study Reilly authored in 2012 estimated that reaching 80% renewable generation would add around 40% to the cost of electricity. Jesse Jenkins and Trembath recently suggested that reaching levels of variable renewables above their ‘capacity factor’ becomes increasingly expensive. Capacity factor is the amount of time your source actually spends generating electricity - for wind 25-35% and solar 10-20%. So going above a third of the market is where the heavy lifting really begins. This would ramp up the costs of preparing the grid for new types of generation, which the Clinton campaign flagged as a spending priority. Weiss estimated this could cost in the range of $100bn over the next 10-15 years, roughly a 5-10% increase on current electricity spending. “My main issue with her target is that it is narrowly constrained to solar,” said Trembath. “The biggest omission I continue to see from Democrats is support for nuclear power, which needs federal support in different ways than most renewable energy technologies do.” In total, Clinton’s pledge will push the zero carbon electricity sector (including nuclear) from 32% today, to about 50% in 2027. Any credible economy-wide climate scheme will need to encompass a great swathe of measures to reduce carbon, said Zindler. “There are other means for lowering CO2 emissions in the US. Our comparatively profligate use of gasoline has been one area of focus and average consumer vehicle fuel efficiency has actually been rising in the US in recent years. More improvements in transport are definitely possible, particularly in the area of trucks. More efficient use of electricity in homes and businesses is also an area that clearly offers opportunities that do not even necessarily need to be policy driven as they offer consumers the opportunity to save money,” he said. Environmentalists were also quick to point out that Clinton was still skirting the big federal policy questions on support for the fossil fuel industry - the Arctic and Keystone XL pipeline. Can Clinton be a climate Heracles “taking on the global threat of climate change”? It’s a start and the rhetoric is certainly bold. But this amounts to a partial decapitation of one head. It will take many more swings to kill the beast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/may/09/solar-power-batteries-the-energy-transition-could-be-profound-and-theres-a-lot-to-lose-for-those-who-cant-keep-up","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-09T02:11:35Z","webTitle":"The energy transition could be profound – and there's a lot to lose for those who can't keep up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/09/solar-power-batteries-the-energy-transition-could-be-profound-and-theres-a-lot-to-lose-for-those-who-cant-keep-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/09/solar-power-batteries-the-energy-transition-could-be-profound-and-theres-a-lot-to-lose-for-those-who-cant-keep-up","fields":{"headline":"The clean energy economy is coming – and there's a lot to lose for those who can't keep up","bodyText":"Change is coming to the energy landscape. A transition to a new energy economy is happening. In a country like Australia – awash with energy both under and above the ground – this transition could be rapid and profound. There is a lot to lose for those who can’t keep pace. Last month the government committed $1bn to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. The fund will have “the primary purpose of earning income or a profitable return” on debt and equity extended to renewable energy, energy efficiency and low-emissions technologies. While many will argue the right way for that money to be used, investment like this is well timed. There are a number of converging technologies driving the transition. Their interaction will affect how we travel, how we live, the way our cities and houses are designed, our fuel supply and attitude to energy efficiency, and even how we interact. One of the maturing technologies is solar. Over the past five years, solar has become a big part of our energy world. The Australian energy market operator estimated last year that by 2023/24 the state of South Australia may, at times, have its entire electricity needs met by solar systems on mostly urban rooftops, without the aid of coal, gas or oil. Together with other renewables, photovoltaics are becoming increasingly competitive. Factoring in the cost of delivering energy through the grid, photovoltaic technology is probably the cheapest electricity supply option at the point of use right now. And it will continue to get cheaper. Another is energy storage. Improvements in battery technology and cost will help overcome the intermittency of renewable energy. Tesla’s push into the consumer mass market is just the beginning of a decade in which electric cars will become significantly more common and at the heart of each electric vehicle is a battery that can store enough electricity to serve the average Australian home for days. Our cars will act as mobile batteries that “plug in” to the home, allowing their energy to be used for household purposes. Batteries will also be installed in our homes, complementing our rooftop solar. Utilities will use them to optimise their grids. This new energy landscape will be more complex, requiring interaction between energy providers and users like never before. Controlling this will be the energy “internet”, a vast array of interconnected devices that will produce, store or use energy. These devices will communicate their energy deficits and surpluses and transport energy to where it is needed most, as well as allowing consumers to remotely control their devices to optimise energy usage. This capability will allow a range of new energy technologies and business models to emerge. Consumers will have more say in what energy they use and how, and by digitally understanding those needs suppliers will be able to optimise their services to align. Another technology reaching maturity is the “smart” energy grid. Despite the self-sufficiency potential of renewable energy, the grid will not become obsolete. Pole and wire infrastructure will allow users to upload and download energy to maximise cost effectiveness and reliability – like off-peak hot water is used now but much more complex. As energy utilisation is automised, unintentional consumption will fall. As with any fundamental disruption, there will be winners and losers. Foreseeing and harnessing the potential of the convergence won’t be easy for incumbents or new entrants. Significant investment will be required to develop and commercialise businesses and technology capable of harnessing the possibilities of convergence. But the potential pay-off for businesses that get it right will be huge. There will be other benefits as well. Until now, I have barely mentioned emissions. The energy transition is happening without reference to its environmental value. And yet, there are environment-related drivers. The final, published agreement from COP21, the climate change-related Conference of Parties 21 held in Paris last December, aims for essentially zero net emissions by 2050, the world over. Why are governments the world over suddenly willing to agree to such ambitious targets? The scientific consensus to act on climate has strengthened, for one. But pragmatic governments may also be seeing signs of tangible, real solutions emerging in energy markets. The timetable outlined in Paris for emissions reductions appears to align well with the published convergence of technologies – very roughly in the next 10 or so years. This, of course, could just be a coincidence but, if so, it is well timed. Decarbonisation of the global economy now has a route that is starting to make commercial sense. Coal, oil and gas will continue as primary energy supplies for some time and simply being more efficient with our energy use is the first way to reduce emissions. As technology converges, we won’t need to be convinced that we should consider the environment: we will be too busy focusing on the economic benefits.

But the two sources of renewable energy are far from getting equal love from corporate America. Wind energy has long been the favorite. Businesses, not counting power companies, signed 2,000 megawatts of it in 2015, a jump from 100 megawatts in 2009, according to the American Wind Energy Association. Wind energy is enabling Google, the largest corporate buyer of renewable electricity in the world, to hit the 100% renewable energy goal, which it expects to achieve next year. The company has inked 2,548 megawatts of wind contracts and 141 megawatts of solar from projects around the world. Interest in solar energy is growing, but at a slower rate. Solar contracts shot up to 1,070 megawatts in 2015 from 339 megawatts in 2010, said the Solar Energy Industries Association. Wind energy has historically been much cheaper than solar, making it a more attractive option, especially when energy can be a major expense for a company. As more businesses come under pressure from their customers, investors or government regulators to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and help rein in global warming, they will be looking for low-carbon energy that can compete with the price of coal and natural gas. Wind and solar are not the only sources of electricity with lower carbon footprints than coal and natural gas. Hydropower and nuclear are too, and, unlike solar and wind, are able to produce electricity any time. But hydropower plants require access to ample sources of surface water. A nuclear power plant can take longer to secure permits and cost more than building other types of power plants. “Corporate participation (in buying solar and wind) is still relatively new,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft, which recently announced the biggest wind energy contract, at 178 megawatts, in its renewable energy portfolio. “It’s only within the last few years that we’ve seen an uptick, and we’ve yet to fully address the challenges in expanding this market.” A head start America pioneered early research and development of commercial turbines, installing the world’s first wind farm in 1980 and leading the amount of installations, in megawatts, until the late 1990s, when Germany and eventually China began to catch up and then slowly push ahead. Solar hasn’t experienced the same long term and consistent investments and construction, which help to lower cost. Wind power costs cratered 66% in the last six years, said the American Wind Energy Association. The lowest price for a wind contract is around $0.02 per kilowatt-hour while it’s $0.03 for solar, said Ryan Wiser, a renewable energy market researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, part of the US Department of Energy. That minor difference in price can add up to a hefty bill for heavy users of electricity, such as data centers that require an around-the-clock electricity supply. More than half of the 4,000 megawatts of new wind energy contracts last year, and 3,440 megawatts this year, were signed by companies across industries from tech to grocery chains, according to the wind trade association and the Rocky Mountain Institute. Utilities bought the rest. Amazon, for example, has invested more in wind and solar in the past two years. It’s paying for power from a 150-megawatt wind farm in Indiana and waiting for a 208-megawatt wind project in North Carolina to come online soon. It’s also signed agreements for several hundred megawatts of new wind energy that are scheduled to start delivery in 2017. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Dow Chemical and 3M are buying five times more wind than solar, said Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Why solar is playing catch-up Solar has become an increasingly attractive option following a massive construction of factories to build solar panels, mostly notably in China. Prices for solar contracts have dived 63% over the last five years, said the solar trade association. In the 2016 ranking of top corporate solar energy buyers, Target gets the top spot with 147.5 megawatts of installed capacity, according to the solar trade association. The retailer is followed by industrial real estate developer Prologis (107.8 megawatts), Apple (93.9 megawatts), Costco (50.7 megawatts) and Kohl’s (50.2 megawatts). Businesses looking to sign renewable energy contracts or even develop their own solar or wind projects often find themselves on a steep learning curve about borrowing money, structuring contracts and understanding the complex rules that govern the electric industry. Getting rid of these road blocks will encourage more companies to lower their use of fossil fuel energy, business leaders said. For a company that operates in many states or even countries, figuring out a way to standardize renewable energy contracts helps it to save money and time, Janous said. “How do we make deals more attainable for not just Microsoft but smaller companies? There has to be some simplification,” he added. In cities where the local power companies don’t offer much, if any, wind or solar energy for sale, businesses could install their own solar panels or wind turbines on their properties. The cost of this do-it-yourself model has historically been higher than paying for electricity supplied by the local utilities, noted Herve Touati, managing director of Rocky Mountain Institute’s Business Renewable Center. But that cost is coming down and, in some cases, lower than the electricity from the grid. “It’s cheaper for Microsoft to use onsite generation than ask utilities to double their existing grids,” Touati said. Companies with renewable energy contracts or a stake in a solar or wind farm typically don’t use that low-carbon electricity directly – electricity from power plants of all types usually enters the transmission lines and gets mixed up. As a result, businesses would count the amount of solar or wind they pay for against their overall electricity use to calculate their carbon footprint reduction. Despite uncertainties about the impact of a Trump administration on renewable energy – the president-elect has criticized regulations that pressure businesses to address climate change – businesses and market analysts said the prices for renewable energy have fallen steep enough to make them a more feasible option. “Certainly, there are many policy questions yet to be answered, but I don’t see the US election having a significant impact on our commitments,” Janous said. The article was amended on 27 December 2016. The charts on wind energy contracts signed by top corporate buyers showed data in gigawatts when they should be in megawatts."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2017/apr/07/an-adder-stirs-a-brawny-cable-charged-by-the-sun","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-07T04:30:00Z","webTitle":"An adder stirs, a brawny cable charged by the sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/07/an-adder-stirs-a-brawny-cable-charged-by-the-sun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/apr/07/an-adder-stirs-a-brawny-cable-charged-by-the-sun","fields":{"headline":"An adder stirs, a brawny cable charged by the sun","bodyText":"Beneath the granite knuckles of this east Dartmoor tor the land spreads and softens high above the valley. Sheep-clipped grasses and scattered clumps of gorse cover the sides of the outcrop, punctuated by exposed boulders. After a lengthy spell of rain, morning sunshine makes a welcome change, and the temperature along this south-facing incline is climbing steadily. I follow a path worn in the thin turf a short distance up the slope before cutting across rough ground. At the base of an overgrown bank, a shape on a sheltered patch of grass a couple of paces ahead stops me in my tracks: a thick cylindrical form, bent double like a section of trombone pipe and lying motionless in the sun. Nothing brings you to a halt like an adder. Perfectly camouflaged, it would have been easy to miss; its clay-pale body with the charcoal-black zigzag running the length of its back blending with shadows cast by surrounding bracken. This is the first adder I have come across on Dartmoor – where the snakes are believed to be holding their own despite national declines blamed on the loss of undisturbed, open, habitat. The dark block-print markings indicate that this 2ft specimen is a male, recently emerged from hibernation ahead of browner and larger females; over the spring rival males will battle in a sinuous test of strength known as the “dance of the adders”. The snake has felt my approach and stirs from its slumber, a muscular cable charged with solar energy. Packing a venomous bite – though one that rarely proves deadly, with Britain’s last fatality recorded in 1975 – the adder also has an unblinking red gaze which betrays no sign of fear. Yet this long-persecuted species prefers to keep out of sight, and, in a moment, it slips away, disappearing into the undergrowth. Nearby I come across another, basking close to cover, and then a tangle of three males coiled like Cumberland sausages beside a rock.

One proposal was to place greater emphasis on local ownership and control of projects. The idea is simple: rather than providing ready-made solutions that might not be right for a particular country, development assistance should facilitate access to tools that enable people to come up with their own fixes. In India, community groups set up in villages and slums to tackle specific problems are known as self-help groups. These groups, typically predominantly female, are often established to access microfinance loans, but they can also lead members towards the possibilities offered by new technologies. In Raipur, a city in central India, groups are partnering with businesses and NGOs to produce useful, relevant products using open-source technologies, thereby offering members a chance to create sustainable livelihoods. These technologies – which include self-replicating 3D printers and “instructables” for making your own solar panels – are generally cheap to access. They are shared and co-developed by collectives, usually online. After exploring opportunities, needs and interests, participants in the Eco-Green Livelihoods project decided to produce solar power systems capable of lighting homes in rural villages that remain off-grid. Working together, local technicians and NGO staff used open-source designs shared online to produce the solar sets. Unlike solar-powered products manufactured in large facilities using designs that are the exclusive intellectual property of large corporations, this kind of project trains marginalised communities to build low-cost products that will answer basic needs in a region crippled by electricity shortages. All the materials required to make the sets – solar panels, batteries and the basic components of electronic circuits – are available in nearby markets. Because the design information is freely available, and the materials are easily accessible, a moderately skilled technician can train people from the slums to make a robust product capable of solving their development problems. Ram Kumar, a technician, trains a mainly female group to make the solar power systems. “These women, who have little education and previously could only get a few hours of work a week cleaning other people’s homes, have now learned to make this fairly technical product and are earning a much better living,” Kumar says. The £20 device manufactured and marketed by the group provides a small amount of uninterrupted, free, off-grid electricity. The money is not enough to run big screen TVs or air conditioners, but it is ample for two or three light bulbs, a charging point for a family’s mobile phone, and a few other essentials. Collectively, these things make a big difference to people’s lives. The cost is high for most people, but sometimes it is subsidised, or people can pay in instalments. This is exactly what is needed in the hundreds of rural villages across India where people have no access to the grid. Group members install the solar lighting systems in people’s homes, collect the payments in monthly instalments, and take responsibility for regular maintenance. Because of their personal involvement, villagers see their new access to electricity as a collective achievement, and participants enjoy a small collective savings account, funded by sales of their products. They can use this money to invest in other projects in the village. Sometimes, these local initiatives can even catalyse action from the state. A village in Mahasamund district, Chhattisgarh, was the first to achieve complete solar lighting through the Eco-Green project. After years of government inaction, the village was connected to the grid within a month of installing the solar power systems. But some villagers were unimpressed by this tardy official intervention. Shruti, the first lady to install a solar-powered light, told me how the project had changed her life. “This [solar] light is free, so why would we switch on the other one? They have installed the electric line because now they see we have power.” This process of building livelihoods and meeting development needs is one potential solution to the problem of off-grid or “mini-grid” electrification. And while it may not completely eradicate energy inequality, achieving access to power through collective action is a good first step. Using a small technological innovation – like open-source solar – individuals can take control, and their actions can strengthen the impact of development assistance and multiply the transformative potential of technologies.

Zac Goldsmith put down six questions between November 2011 and February 2012 after the government announced it would slash subsidies to the solar industry. Goldsmith warned MPs that there was panic in the industry over ministers’ plans. His younger brother, Ben, a venture capitalist, had personally invested in one solar energy firm Engensa, which described the cuts as unacceptable. Ben Goldsmith’s investment fund, WHEB, also owned a quarter of Engensa’s software partner, PassivSystems, a firm valued at £40m in 2014. Zac Goldsmith also has a personal stake in a separate £24m investment fund run by WHEB and by 2011 his younger brother had donated £15,000 to his parliamentary office, according to the Commons’ register of members’ interests. Despite these links, the Tory MP did not declare his brother’s interests when intervening in the Commons. Parliamentary rules at the time stated MPs should declare “any past, present or expected future financial interest, direct or indirect … when a member is making a speech in the House or in committee or participating in any other proceedings of the House”, that might “reasonably be thought by others to influence the speech, representation or communication in question”. It goes on to say that the declaration should be “brief but should make specific reference to the nature of the interest”. A spokesman for Goldsmith said he had declared his interests properly, adding that when the Tory MP had asked the questions in parliament, the code of conduct only required conflicts of interests that arose from spouses and partners to be identified. The 2009 parliamentary code of conduct, which applied at the time, said MPs are “required to declare relevant indirect interests, for instance those of a spouse or partner, and also non-registrable interests of a financial nature where these are affected by the proceedings in question”. Labour said it would be calling for an investigation into why the London mayoral candidate did not declare the Goldsmith family interest. Caroline Flint, the Labour MP who was shadow energy and climate change secretary under Ed Miliband, said: “It seems reasonable to conclude that Zac Goldsmith should have declared the conflict of interest between his family’s personal financial involvement with this company, including his brother’s central role, and the companies held within its small portfolio when asking government ministers questions and involving himself in the writing of reports.” She added that she would be writing to the parliamentary authorities shortly to demand a full investigation. Since last year, the parliamentary rules have been updated to explicitly list the types of relation – “parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece of the MP or of a spouse, civil partner or cohabiting partner of the MP” – whose relevant business interests would have to be mentioned by an MP in “any proceeding of the House”. On the campaign trail Zac Goldsmith, an environmentalist with a £300m personal fortune, has promised voters he will build a “solar revolution” in the capital if he becomes London mayor. Ben Goldsmith, a banker, keeps a lower profile but has led the charge to bring sun-powered panels to Britain’s roofs. By 2011, the then 31-year-old venture capitalist had financed and taken stakes in a series of companies that used British and European Union public subsidies to sell solar energy systems to homeowners. The network of companies that were connected to Ben Goldsmith relied on a steady stream of cash from “feed-in tariffs” that paid a fixed sum for 25 years per kWh of solar energy produced. In October 2011, coalition ministers announced that these solar subsidies would be slashed by half, a move one of Ben Goldsmith’s firms – Engensa – said would “result in massive job losses”. A year after the government’s environmental support was slashed, Ben Goldsmith’s Engensa was sold to a Chinese firm. Critics also accuse Goldsmith of political hypocrisy as he backs Britain’s exit from Europe despite his brother’s investments benefiting from EU funds that tech businesses would be denied in the event of a Brexit. Flint said: “Given what we have learned about Zac Goldsmith and his family’s investments, it appears unlikely he would not understand how the European Union helps British companies in high-growth sectors, such as green energy, get access to the investment they need from across Europe. So it is hypocritical of him to seek to deny the same opportunities to British companies if the UK left the European Union.” Both brothers are key movers in Tory green politics: Ben Goldsmith chairs the Conservative Environment Network, which promotes “decentralised, market-orientated solutions” to environmental issues. Zac Goldsmith is on the network’s steering committee. They draw their wealth from the billion-pound inheritance of their late father, Sir James Goldsmith, a corporate raider turned anti-EU politician. According to his financial return, posted as part of his bid to be London’s mayor, in the two years from 2010 Zac Goldsmith made more than £1m in capital gains. Ben Goldsmith has key roles in the family’s finances: he is a director of Cavamont Holdings, the Goldsmith’s investment holding vehicle, which was registered offshore in the Cayman Islands in 2005. He is central in overseeing the holding company’s investments – chairing its family committee. WHEB, in which Ben Goldsmith had a stake, last year received £5m in backing from the state-owned British Business Bank. It also controlled Zac Goldsmith’s personal investments in a £24m private equity fund along with stakes held by the Goldsmith family’s offshore vehicle Verton Holdings. The Tory MP recorded his investment in the private equity fund in the parliamentary register. He states he receives “no income and nor do I have any influence on the investments made”. In February, WHEB sold up and exited from its role in managing the funds, with its 25% stake purchased by German partners Alpina. Ben Goldsmith has continued his role in green investment. He has set up a new fund Menhaden – raising £80m from the stockmarket last year – and took stakes in the WHEB funds. He did not answer questions about his shareholdings and business interests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/dec/21/india-renewable-energy-paris-climate-summit-target","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-22T07:01:55Z","webTitle":"India plans nearly 60% of electricity capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2027","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/21/india-renewable-energy-paris-climate-summit-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/dec/21/india-renewable-energy-paris-climate-summit-target","fields":{"headline":"India plans nearly 60% of electricity capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2027","bodyText":"The Indian government has forecast that it will exceed the renewable energy targets set in Paris last year by nearly half and three years ahead of schedule. A draft 10-year energy blueprint published this week predicts that 57% of India’s total electricity capacity will come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2027. The Paris climate accord target was 40% by 2030. The forecast reflects an increase in private sector investment in Indian renewable energy projects over the past year, according to analysts. The draft national electricity plan also indicated that no new coal-fired power stations were likely to be required to meet Indian energy needs until at least 2027, raising further doubts over the viability of Indian mining investments overseas, such as the energy company Adani’s Carmichael mine in Queensland, the largest coalmine planned to be built in Australia. India’s energy minister, Piyush Goyal, has been appealing to wealthier nations to provide capital to invest in renewable energy projects to help the country reach and exceed the targets agreed in Paris in November 2015. Significant state investment has not been forthcoming, but Tim Buckley, a director at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said India had made up the shortfall with an influx of capital from the domestic and overseas private sectors in the past 12 months. Japan’s Softbank has committed to invest $20bn (£16.2bn) in the Indian solar energy sector, in conjunction with Taiwanese company Foxconn and Indian business group Bharti Enterprises. In September the largely French state-owned energy company EDF announced it would invest $2bn in Indian renewable energy projects, citing the country’s enormous projected demand and “fantastic” potential of its wind and solar radiation. Adani opened the world’s largest solar plant in Tamil Nadu earlier this year, and in October the energy conglomerate Tata announced that it would aim to generate as much as 40% of its energy from renewable sources by 2025. Buckley said India’s “absolutely transformational” forecast was also driven by technological advancements that have led to the price of solar energy falling by 80% in the past five years. “India is moving beyond fossil fuels at a pace scarcely imagined only two years ago,” he said. “Goyal has put forward an energy plan that is commercially viable and commercially justified without subsidies, so you have big global corporations and utilities committing to it.” In the 2027 forecasts, India aims to generate 275 gigawatts of total renewable energy, in addition to 72GW of hydroenergy and 15GW of nuclear energy. Nearly 100GW would come from “other zero emission” sources, with advancements in energy efficiency expected to reduce the need for capacity increases by 40GW over 10 years. About 50GW of coal power projects being developed in India would be “largely stranded” under the forecast, Buckley said, with official modelling showing that “none of these plants are required before 2022 and only possible before 2027”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/mar/19/solar-power-industry-jobs-market-coal-west-virginia","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-19T14:00:09Z","webTitle":"Green energy in a coal state: the struggle to bring solar jobs to West Virginia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/mar/19/solar-power-industry-jobs-market-coal-west-virginia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/mar/19/solar-power-industry-jobs-market-coal-west-virginia","fields":{"headline":"Green energy in a coal state: the struggle to bring solar jobs to West Virginia","bodyText":"If solar energy were Dan Conant’s only passion, the West Virginia native could have stayed in Vermont, working for a fast-growing startup in a state friendly to renewables. Instead, Conant returned home to Shepherdstown, where he started an installation company, Solar Holler, in 2014. Now, with three employees and a crew under contract, Conant’s new passion comes with an audacious goal: bring solar jobs to communities hit hard by the decline of coal. “I really feel like we’re in a race against time, that it’s important we diversify quickly so young folks don’t have to move away,” says Conant. “It’s been really frustrating over the years to see all of my friends leave – pretty much everyone I went to high school with. The state is experiencing a serious brain drain.” Conant is part of a small group of entrepreneurs who believe in the possibility of replacing disappearing coal jobs with employment in solar in West Virginia. It’s a monumental challenge. The state lacks the mix of solar-friendly regulations, financial incentives and high electricity prices that have made solar affordable and created a booming market in states such as California and Massachusetts. Despite the odds, Conant and his allies are finding ways around some of the obstacles. They point to the falling cost of solar energy systems that will help to make renewable energy more attractive to West Virginians. Conant and other proponents of solar also believe that the market forces that have made coal a more expensive and less desirable commodity will eventually persuade the state’s politicians to abandon the idea of resurrecting the declining industry. The economic picture of West Virginia is bleak. The Mountain State has the nation’s seventh-highest poverty rate. The number of coal jobs dropped from nearly 25,000 in 2011 to fewer than 11,500 in the third quarter of 2016. And those numbers only represent mining itself. When mines shut down, it affects everything – local businesses that serve the industry’s employees and their families lose revenue and government services are hurt by a shrinking tax base. Automation and less labor-intensive extraction methods such as strip mining and mountaintop removal caused job losses for decades, but stricter environmental regulations and a boom in natural gas, which made it cheaper than coal, have contributed to steeper job cuts in recent years, says Brian Lego, a research assistant professor who studies the coalmining industry at West Virginia University. Coal production fell from 158m tons in 2008 to 80m tons in 2016, Lego says. The state’s political leaders recognize the need to promote industries beyond coal, but their plans don’t include the renewable energy sector. The newly elected governor, Jim Justice, says he wants to create more jobs in harvesting timber, building roads and other infrastructure, tourism and agriculture. Justice, a billionaire Democrat who owns a resort, a coal company and a large farm operation, also isn’t giving up on reviving the coal business. With just over 1.8 million residents, West Virginia ranks 38th in population but second only to Illinois in population loss. Federal census data shows that the state’s population fell by 10,000 people during the 12 months ending July 2016. Against the depressing backdrop, the growth of the solar industry nationwide offers hope to people like 31-year-old Conant. The industry employed more than 260,000 people in 2016, a 25% increase over the previous year, according to the annual job census by the Solar Foundation. The survey, which counts full and part-time workers, found 381 solar-related jobs in West Virginia in 2016, including installation, sales, project development and manufacturing. One of the state’s largest installers, Mountain View Solar, based in Berkeley Springs in the eastern panhandle, employs about 25 people and works on projects in neighboring Maryland, Pennsylvania and Washington DC. The capacity for generating solar electricity from systems at homes and businesses reached 5.1 megawatts in West Virginia in 2016, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That’s a tiny amount compared with the 2,583 megawatts installed in the US residential market in 2016 alone. One of Conant’s strategies to build a strong business is to contract workers from Coalfield Development Corp, a nonprofit training organization in the south-western county of Wayne that offers a 2.5-year, paid apprenticeship program and employs 50 staff members and apprentices. Coalfield trains its workers to do a variety of construction work, including installing solar panels and electrical equipment. The partnership is cost effective for Conant because his company doesn’t shoulder the cost of recruiting workers or employing them in between installations, when they are redeployed on other Coalfield construction projects. “It sounds really bold to say it, but what we’re trying to do is to rebuild the Appalachian economy from the ground up,” says Brandon Dennison, Coalfield’s co-founder and CEO, who grew up in Wayne County. “We’re not ashamed to say we need to diversify our economy because it’s not been good for anybody to be so dependent on one thing. We don’t get into the moral argument of coal being good or bad, we just talk about jobs and entrepreneurship.” Since joining forces in 2015, Solar Holler and Coalfield have done rooftop solar projects and LED lighting installations for churches, a public library, a building owned by Catholic Charities, some affordable housing units and local businesses. Solar Holler is working on 1 megawatt-worth of projects at various stages of development, or enough to power about 100 homes, Conant says. Coalfield offers out-of-worker miners, such as Jared Blalock, a chance to learn new skills, including solar installation. “I enjoy the work,” says Blalock, a 29-year-old father of two boys who worked in the mines for six years. “It’s a lot easier on the body, I’ll tell you that.” But at this point, he can’t count on solar work for long-term employment, he says, and a small nonprofit like Coalfield can’t compete with coal industry pay. Like the other apprentices, Blalock works 33 hours a week while earning a college degree, which he hopes will lead to a higher-paying job in construction management. The coal industry’s pay typically starts at $60,000 to $70,000, and he was making even more when he got laid off. “Last year I made $77,000, so I’ve taken a 50-60% pay cut,” Blalock says. Creating better-paying jobs will depend partly on whether companies are able to increase demand by helping their customers finance the purchase of solar systems. The state prohibits purchase agreements for power or solar leases, which are popular in solar-friendly states and allow people to pay little or no upfront cost to install solar panels. Instead, West Virginians have to pay in full with cash or a loan. A residential solar energy system generally costs between $15,000 and $20,000 on average nationwide, before a federal tax credit that offsets it by 30%. The tax credit doesn’t apply to nonprofit organizations, however. That has prompted Conant to experiment with different ways to help Solar Holler’s customers find funding. He came up with a solution for several projects, including a $55,000 rooftop system at Shepherdstown Presbyterian. Solar Holler helped arrange for a bank loan and lined up 100 members in the community who were willing to help pay off the loan by having an energy control device on their water heaters. The device, installed by Mosaic Power in Maryland, allows Mosaic Power to remotely turn the heaters on or off to help the electric grid operator manage supply and demand. For example, the grid operator pays to shut off heaters – in short intervals that won’t interrupt hot water use – when demand for electricity is high. Each household with the device can earn about $100 a year, which the folks in Shepherdstown donate to the church to pay off the loan. Building a solar market in a coal state will require patience. Coalfield is set to begin work on a new solar training center, located in Huntington, but the training there will include retrofitting lighting and installing cables because there aren’t yet enough solar projects for new recruits. The lack of supportive policies and low electricity rates are keeping many other solar companies away from West Virginia for now. “Because electricity is relatively cheap in West Virginia, it hurts the economics of installing a solar system, though that may not always be the case,” says Michael Kirby, the regional sales manager for Maryland and Washington DC for Direct Energy Solar. He points out that electricity prices tend to rise rather than fall, saying: “The cost to install solar has been cut in half over the last five or six years, which has made it viable in a lot of states where it wasn’t before.” Still, Direct Energy, which operates in a number of Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, has no plans to move into the Mountain State quite yet. Conant, meanwhile, is undeterred. “Renewables are going to be the main source of energy long term – it’s just a question of when,” he says. “I believe there’s a role for West Virginia to play, and we don’t necessarily need Californian companies or Massachusetts companies to come in and build up the industry for us. We can do it ourselves.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/feb/26/drones-robots-solar-power-plant-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-26T14:00:31Z","webTitle":"How drones are helping design the solar power plants of the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/26/drones-robots-solar-power-plant-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/26/drones-robots-solar-power-plant-energy","fields":{"headline":"How drones are helping design the solar power plants of the future","bodyText":"At the edge of a plot of muddy farmland, a few miles down the road from the University of California at Davis, an engineer takes a few quick steps across crop rows and lets go of a three-foot drone. Within seconds, the device – which weighs less than 2lbs and carries a powerful camera – ascends hundreds of feet into the cold, clear, blue sky and begins to snap detailed photos of the ground far below, including a long row of large solar panels mounted on steel poles. This flight is just a test, demonstrated by Kingsley Chen, the drone fleet coordinator for SunPower at the solar company’s research and development center, which is under construction and about a two-hour drive northeast of the San Francisco Bay Area. The drone will enable SunPower to survey a wide region and help design a solar power farm that can fit more solar panels on a piece of land, more quickly and for lower costs than it previously could. The test highlights a growing use of the latest computing technologies – drones, robots, software, sensors and networks – by US companies to design, build and operate solar farms. After seeing the prices of solar panels drop dramatically over the past decade, companies are looking for new ways to cut costs and compete with fossil fuel power through project design. Cutting down the amount of land used by solar farms has additional benefits, particularly in places like California. It minimizes environmental impact, an issue that can be controversial for large projects built for utilities because they tend to spread across hundreds of acres of land in remote regions. Some of these projects have riled environmentalists, attracted lawsuits and forced solar companies, including SunPower, to commit money for land for wildlife conservation. “Solar companies and service providers are using many different types of technology to optimize both the deployment of solar and the operations and maintenance of solar,” says Justin Baca, the vice president of markets and research for the solar group Solar Energy Industries Association. He adds: “It’s all about cutting costs.” An increase in tech investment could help to boost growth as more large solar and wind farms come online in the US and worldwide over the next few decades. The US Energy Information Administration predicts that more solar power plants will be built and provide 1.4% of the country’s electricity by 2018, up from less than 1% in 2016. While solar makes up a tiny portion, it’s among the fastest-growing sources of new electricity generation capacity in the country. Solar Tetris “It’s like a big Tetris puzzle,” says Matt Campbell, vice president of power plant products at SunPower, as he and his team show off the company’s solar farm design software. On a screen is a detailed image of land that one of SunPower’s 10 survey drones has collected from the sky. Overlaid on the photos are Tetris-looking colored blocks that represent solar panels and inverters, which convert the direct current produced by the panels into electricity for the grid. A SunPower engineer can use the software to fit as many of the blocks as possible while laying out the configuration of a power plant. The company designed its algorithms to take into account hundreds of factors that a human engineer might overlook, such as where transmission lines will be or how much shade will be created by the panels as they follow the sun throughout the day. A decade ago, a survey of a project site would require dispatching a crew to gather information such as the steepness of a slope and the vegetation of the region, explains SunPower’s CEO and president Tom Werner. In contrast, using the software and drones enables engineers to design a project 90% faster, he adds. SunPower, a solar panel maker and solar farm developer in the US, is creating most of the technology it uses for project design. Meanwhile, a cottage industry is growing around creating technology for other solar power developers to design, build and operate solar farms. One of these is HST Solar, a four-and-a-half-year-old startup in Los Angeles that, like SunPower, has developed algorithms to swiftly plot out the best designs, layout and wiring for large solar farms. Using HST Solar’s artificial intelligence software, launched last year, companies can lower the costs of producing solar electricity by 30%, says Santanov Chaudhuri, co-founder of the company. So far, Chaudhuri says that customers have used the company’s software to design about 4 gigawatts of solar projects, which is about the amount of solar panel projects that are installed across the US in a single quarter. It isn’t just the sprawling solar farms that are benefiting from software and design tools. An Oakland, California, startup called PVComplete builds software for designing solar panel projects on rooftops. The software enables any engineer to design a system using a range of solar equipment, while also taking into consideration different local requirements, such as weather, for installing them. Claudia Eyzaquirre, who has worked in the renewable energy business for a decade, co-founded PVComplete in 2015 after noticing that all of the major solar companies were spending big money to build their own design software. But few options were available to smaller solar companies that didn’t have the money to do the same. Solar companies are also turning to the latest in computing technology to operate and maintain solar farms, not just design them. In 2013, SunPower bought a startup called Greenbotics, which developed a robot that lowers the cost of cleaning solar panels while using less water than human washers can do. The Greenbotics team now works on engineering projects at SunPower and manages SunPower’s fleet of 40 solar-panel cleaning robots. Solar developer Strata Solar uses drones with infrared cameras to survey the more than 1 gigawatt of solar projects after they’re operating. The images from the cameras can reveal any solar panels that aren’t producing electricity. “It’s a great way to check on the overall health of the systems,” says Gabe Cantor, Strata Solar’s director of design engineering. “You can spot problems down to the cell level.” Drones – who needs them? While drones are playing an increasing role in the solar industry, many companies aren’t convinced that they are cost effective, notes a report by The Electric Power Research Institute, which conducts research for the power industry. The technology being used by some in the solar industry isn’t as “sexy” as drones, says Jenny Chase, head of the solar research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. A lot of it is “boring tech – like software”. First Solar, one of the largest power plant developers in the country, has experimented with drones for designing power plants and thermal imaging of operating solar farms. But it isn’t rolling them out for company-wide use right now. First Solar’s manager of business development, Jeremy Rand, says drones and robots aren’t sophisticated enough or affordable: “A lot of these technologies are in the experimentation phase and not quite there yet.” The falling prices for solar panels also make it difficult to justify an investment in emerging and more expensive technology, Rand adds. Both First Solar, and fellow manufacturer SunPower, saw their stock prices fall last year and now plan to cut thousands of jobs. “With the solar module price collapse, it’s a tough time to be truly inventive,” Rand says. But overall, the solar industry is investing in better technology because it has a long way to go to replace fossil fuels. The US solar energy industry is also facing an elimination of the tax subsidies that have historically been important for growth. At the same time, President Trump hasn’t made it clear on his policy for solar energy. “Technologies like (ours) can ultimately make solar independent without tax credits, and without subsidies, and much sooner than people think,” HST Solar’s Chaudhuri says."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/12/trump-past-clean-energy-future-america-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-12T10:00:42Z","webTitle":"Trump is the past.

Clean energy is the future for America and the planet","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the historic Paris climate agreement and turn his back on the other 194 countries that signed it leaves him isolated on the world stage. But Trump is also isolated from the very Americans he purports to lead, and here lies hope. Across America, families, businesses, churches, institutions and governments are busy building a clean energy future. And no president can stop that. When he announced he was pulling the US out of the Paris Accord, Trump said: “I was elected to represent the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” And that prompted the mayor of Pittsburgh to join other American mayors – more than 100 so far – in affirming his city’s commitment to move to 100% renewable energy. This reflects the fact that the people of Pittsburgh – and Philadelphia and Phoenix and Salt Lake City and towns and rural areas across America – want clean energy in their backyards. In liberal areas and conservative ones, Americans are transforming the way they power their lives as we move to 100% clean energy for all. Consider Buffalo, in upstate New York. Once an industrial powerhouse dotted with manufacturing and steel mill factories, it lost half its population in the second half of the 20th century and became the third-poorest big city in the United States. It is home to exactly the kind of “forgotten” people Trump talked about on the campaign trail. In a city featuring old houses and tough winters, heating bills regularly cost more than rent for some. But in a once blighted area on the West Side, hundreds of residents are working with Push Buffalo – an organization Rahwa helps run – to weatherproof homes, install solar energy systems and build a stronger community, all while training local residents for good jobs in the emerging green economy. On the other side of the country, California’s Asian Pacific Environmental Network organized in eight different languages, from Korean to Cantonese, to secure $2bn for solar development in low-income housing projects. And in South Los Angeles, a community group called Strategic Concepts in Organizing and Policy Education – Scope – is helping black, Latino and low-income communities of color take advantage of economic and job opportunities in the growing clean-energy economy. But it’s not just city communities that are building a clean energy future that has the power to blunt the worst effects of climate change. So are rural American states, including states whose people voted for Trump. Iowa produced over 36% of its electricity from wind power last year – a bigger share than any other state. South Dakota gets almost 70% of its electricity from water and wind. In Kansas, wind energy has grown from less than 1% of the state’s electricity generation in 2005 to 24% in 2015. American businesses get it, too. Just ask Boeing, whose South Carolina airplane factory is powered by 100% renewable energy. Walmart, General Motors and other major US corporations are major customers for renewable power. In our work with the Solutions Project and Push Buffalo, we have seen how clean and efficient energy projects are everywhere, from universities to churches, from factories to farms and from military bases to shopping malls. Combatting climate change is an important motivation for many of these efforts. But we’ve seen that even Americans who don’t “believe” in climate change are embracing renewable energy. Some of them value cleaner air; others value energy independence and national security and others are called to care for creation. Simplifying it all is the economics: as renewables become as affordable as fossil fuels – and even more affordable – they become more common, and economies of scale make them cheaper still. And people in America are not only embracing these lower bills. They are embracing community ownership of renewable energy infrastructure, creating good local jobs and building local wealth. Their vision is to transform America’s energy economy from a draining and extractive model to a regenerative and sustainable model that makes communities – and the nation – stronger. Time and again, Donald Trump has promised to help forgotten, hard-hit Americans. But trying to hold back the rising tide of clean energy will not help them – and it won’t work, anyway. If Trump truly cared about making life better for the people he was elected to lead, he would join his fellow Americans – and the rest of the world – in building a prosperous, sustainable clean energy future.

The White House launched a tool for people to report if their social media accounts had been “suspended, banned, or fraudulently reported for unclear ‘violations’ of user policies”. Julia Carrie Wong had some questions about it. New York mayor Bill de Blasio is set to announce his bid for the presidency tomorrow. He will be the 24th Democratic candidate in the race. President Trump appointed his 106th federal judge to the bench. Intrepid Guardian reporter Julia Carrie Wong took a look at the White House’s new tool to combat social media tech bias....and found out it’s just a web survey. She made her own survey in response: The Alabama abortion law will most likely be tied up in courts for quite some time - Planned Parenthood has already indicated that it would file a lawsuit. But just a reminder that President Trump has been quietly filling the federal court system with conservative-minded judges for years now. Alabama’s Republican-controlled state senate passed yesterday the most restrictive abortion law in the nation, making it a crime to perform the procedure at any stage of pregnancy. Today, despite protests and lawsuits, governor Kay Ivey signed the bill into law. More from the governor: In all meaningful respects, this bill closely resembles an abortion ban that has been a part of Alabama law for well over 100 years. As today’s bill itself recognizes, that longstanding abortion law has been rendered “unenforceable as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade.” No matter one’s personal view on abortion, we can all recognize that, at least for the short term, this bill may similarly be unenforceable. As citizens of this great country, we must always respect the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court even when we disagree with their decisions. Many Americans, myself included, disagreed when Roe v. Wade was handed down in 1973. The sponsors of this bill believe that it is time, once again, for the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit this important matter, and they believe this act may bring about the best opportunity for this to occur. If you want some more context for the whole national emergency telecoms threat, take a listen to this episode of Today in Focus in which Guardian reporters Rupert Neate, Alex Hern and Tania Branigan discuss Huawei, the company at the center of it all. Senator Kamala Harris tossed some sass into the Democratic race today when she was asked about running mates. Typically when this question comes up for the junior senator from California, it’s framed around whether she would be this or that candidate’s vice president. Instead, she turned the question on its head and pulled in former vice president Joe Biden, who has a strong lead in almost every national poll. “If people want to speculate about running mates, I encourage that, because I think that Joe Biden would be a great running mate,” she said. “As vice president, he’s proven that he knows how to do the job.” “Good Morning America” announced that New York mayor Bill de Blasio is scheduled to appear on the show tomorrow morning, sending tongues wagging that he will be announcing that he will be the 24th candidate in this race. Within minutes, a campaign spokeswoman confirmed the announcement to NBC News. President Trump has long been outspoken about social media companies banning far-right and other extremist figures. Today, it appears that the White House has launched a tool for people to report if their accounts had been “suspended, banned, or fraudulently reported for unclear ‘violations’ of user policies”. “SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS should advance FREEDOM OF SPEECH,” the landing page reads. “No matter your views, if you suspect political bias caused such an action to be taken against you, share your story with President Trump.” Visit the page here. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over the blog for Joanna Walters and Jessica Glenza. In case you missed it, here’s FCC chairman Ajit Pai’s statement on President Trump’s national emergency declaration over alleged telecoms threats from foreign companies. Here’s a quick recap of what’s been happening this Wednesday afternoon: Donald Trump has just declared a national emergency, barring US companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms that could pose a national security risk. This paves a path for a ban on business with Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. Commercial flights between the US and Venezuela have been suspended by acting US homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan because conditions in Venezuela threaten the “safety and security of passengers, aircraft and crew”. Many airlines have already stopped flying to the country because of security concerns. Abortion providers in Ohio have formally filed a lawsuit against the so-called “fetal heartbeat” bill that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Lawmakers in Ohio, like their counterparts in Alabama yesterday, enacted the law to tee up a legal challenge to Roe vs Wade. A California man who threatened to kill employees of the Boston Globe after the newspaper made calls last year for media organizations to denounce Trump has pleaded guilty in federal court this afternoon. At the same time, Trump went on a Tweet-vent against the New York Times and the Washington Post. Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring US companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms posing a national security risk, paving the way for a ban on doing business with China’s Huawei Technologies Co, Reuters writes. The news agency had reported yesterday that Trump was expected to take action on the long-awaited proposal this week. The executive order invokes the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president the authority to regulate commerce in response to a national emergency that threatens the United States. The order directs the Commerce Department, working with other government agencies, to draw up a plan for enforcement. Amid a deepening trade war with China, President Trump on Wednesday declared a “national emergency” to protect U.S. communications networks in a move that gives the federal government broad powers to bar American companies from doing business with certain foreign suppliers — including the Chinese firm Huawei, the Washington Post writes. More to follow.... Now back to the issue of the day: abortion rights. This hour we travel metaphorically to Utah, where a chief prosecutor in the county with the state’s only two clinics that provide abortion has said he won’t enforce strict, new legislation there. A recent law in Utah bans abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy, and is already the subject of a court challenge and cannot currently be enforced, the Salt Lake Tribune has reported. This week the Salt Lake County district attorney, Sim Gill, a Democrat, became the latest example of an official resisting ultra-conservative new restrictions around the US. Gill said the Utah ban appears unconstitutional, so any idea of taking up the legislation’s provision to file felony charges against doctors who perform abortions, as the court challenge plays out, could violate their rights. “I think that’s the only legal and ethical thing for me to do, which is not use the power of my office to violate the constitutional rights of my citizens when there is well-established precedent that says it is unconstitutional,” he said, the AP reports. The decision by Gill and echoes a similar one from the attorney general of Michigan. With anti-abortion advocates optimistic designing extreme legislation as a route to challenging Roe vs Wade, blue-leaning states are moving to secure access to abortions. Against that backdrop, pushback from prosecutors could become more common, especially in politically mixed areas, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at Florida State University College of Law. Prosecutors also have a lot of discretion about how laws are enforced because they decide who to charge and what cases to file. Before the 1973 decision legalizing abortion, many bans weren’t enforced unless there were complications, Ziegler said. “You’ll see more statements of this kind. But how they’ll be enforced is much more complicated than what first may seem to be the case,” she said. Most laws have exceptions. The measure in Utah has allowances for cases of rape, fatal fetal deformity and serious detriment to a woman’s health. Like Utah, Arkansas has also passed a ban on abortions after 18 weeks. Gill secured a federal order on Monday confirming his office won’t have to enforce the measure while the court challenge there plays out. However, if the law is eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court, Gill said, he likely would have to enforce it. “My job is to keep my personal beliefs out of it, but I absolutely believe that our citizens have constitutional rights and our institutions have an obligation to serve those citizens and not simply roll over and play dead,” he said. Michigan’s attorney general, Dana Nessel, also a Democrat, pledged at a state Planned Parenthood conference not to enforce the state’s pre-existing abortion ban if Roe is ever overturned. This afternoon the president, once again, decided to tweet-vent against the New York Times and the Washington Post, calling both organs fake news for reporting that there’s in-fighting among his foreign policy team. As this was happening, a California man who threatened to kill employees of the Boston Globe after the newspaper last year called on media organizations nationwide to denounce Donald Trump’s attacks on the media pleaded guilty in federal court, prosecutors said. Robert Chain, 68, of Los Angeles, pleaded guilty to seven counts of making threatening communications in interstate commerce, the US attorney’s office in Boston said in a statement, according to the Associated Press. He faces five years in prison per count at his sentencing, scheduled for September 23. Neither Chain nor his attorney spoke when they left court. But his attorney, William Weinreb, said last month his client took “full responsibility” for his actions. “He is anxious to make a full, public apology, expressing his sincere remorse to those he affected,” Weinreb said in an email last month. Shady! Bill Barr, Nancy Pelosi and handcuffs all in one sentence. Fox News producer Jake Gibson tweets that the attorney general got actual facetime with the House Speaker earlier and apparently he asked if she’d brought her handcuffs. Pelosi, earlier this month accused William Barr, of committing a “crime” when he told lawmakers during a congressional hearing in April that he was unaware that special counsel Robert Mueller was unhappy with his portrayal of the findings from the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any collusion or obstruction of justice by the president of the Trump campaign. “The attorney general of the United States of America was not telling the truth to the Congress of the United States,” she said at the time. “And that’s a crime.” North Carolina’s most infamous political story lines of recent years are merging into a congressional race this summer that pits the architect of the state’s “bathroom bill” against a Democrat who was granted an electoral do-over after evidence of ballot fraud tainted his prior opponent’s campaign. State Sen. Dan Bishop topped nine other Republican candidates seeking the 9th Congressional District nomination on Tuesday, winning almost half of the ballots cast in an extremely low turnout election that drew less than 10% of the eligible voters. He will face Democrat Dan McCready, as well as Libertarian and Green candidates, on Sept. 10. Bishop’s role as sponsor of a headline-grabbing “bathroom bill” that voided anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people is likely to be a focal point in this repeat race, ordered by election officials who deemed last year’s contest too tainted to stand. And despite the low turnout on Tuesday, the general election could draw a heavy infusion of political cash on both sides because it’s virtually alone on the political calendar this year. The vote count last November showed McCready, a former Marine and Harvard MBA, narrowly losing to Republican Mark Harris. But then, an investigation found Harris ignored warnings and paid a political operative who collected mail-in ballots. Harris opted not to run again. In 2016, Bishop sponsored House Bill 2, the law that voided a Charlotte ordinance expanding LGBT rights and prevented similar anti-discrimination rules anywhere else in the state. HB2 was nicknamed the “bathroom bill” because it also directed transgender people to use public bathrooms and showers that matched their birth sex. The measure made waves nationally and prompted boycotts by entertainers, governments and some businesses thinking about moving jobs to North Carolina. Bishop said while voters knew HB2 had his whole-hearted backing, the law was partially repealed in 2017 and is no longer as important as other issues. “People are astonished and amazed and dismayed at what they see coming out of Washington these days from liberal crazy clowns. Socialism. Open borders. Infanticide. 90% tax rates. Having prison inmates vote. It goes on and on,” Bishop told supporters Tuesday night. “And of course, most of all, an incessant drive to impeach the president.” With conflict between President Donald Trump and Washington Democrats heating up after the investigation into Russian support for the president’s 2016 campaign, the four-month contest between Bishop and McCready is expected to serve as a measure of political tides and an open vault for donors. McCready ran a solar-energy financing fund before starting his run for Congress two years ago. He’s built up his name recognition over the extended campaign and had almost $1.6 million in cash on hand as of May 2, according to Federal Election Commission reports. But McCready will be swimming upstream in a congressional district that has been in GOP hands since 1963 and which Trump won by 12 percentage points in 2016. The district stretches from suburban Charlotte to suburban Fayetteville along the South Carolina border. Bishop accused McCready of refusing to clearly state his positions on public issues during last year’s primary and general elections. McCready “went through two elections without telling anyone where he stood on anything. That ends tomorrow,” Bishop said Tuesday night. McCready last year said he would not support Nancy Pelosi for her top leadership role in the U.S. House. She was elected speaker in January after Democrats took over the House majority. McCready refused during an October debate to rule in or out whether he supported impeaching Trump. But the GOP’s brand also has suffered in the wake of the much-publicized investigation into Harris’s campaign, followed last month by federal charges accusing the state party’s chairman of working with a big-money donor to try bribing North Carolina’s top insurance regulator. As states such as Georgia and Alabama move to near-total bans on abortion, often making the procedure illegal before women know they are pregnant, men are likely to also be severely impacted. Like many other states, Georgia has robust child support laws with financial consequences. Here is a run-down of what the impacts could be for men from Quartz: A ‘non-custodial parent,’ or the parent any child doesn’t live with (the man in about 80% of the cases in the US), is required to turn over a significant portion of his income in Georgia to the custodial parent until the child finishes high school, or is 20 years old, whichever comes first. That amount now depends on a calculation of both parents’ income and health care costs; 20% of gross pay was standard in Georgia in the past. The secretary of homeland security announced conditions in Venezuela threaten the “safety and security of passengers, aircraft and crew,” and suspended flights to the South American country. Reuters reported that Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and many airlines had already stopped flying to the country because of security concerns. American Airlines Group Inc indefinitely suspended flights to Venezuela in March. In April, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. air operators from flying below 26,000 feet in Venezuela’s airspace. Last week, the Trump administration expanded sanctions to pressure President Nicolas Maduro to cede power to Juan Guaido. The White House has criticized House Democrats’ investigation into obstruction of justice by the president as serving “political theater.” In turn, the lawmaker in charge of those investigations called the White House position “preposterous” in an interview. The letter was sent by White House council Pat Cipollone, in response to a March request by Congressional investigators for documents. In a 12-page letter, Cipollone asked the committee to narrow its “sweeping” request and provide a legislative reason why the documents should be released, according to Reuters. The White House will not participate in the committee’s ‘investigation’ that brushes aside the conclusions of the Department of Justice after a two-year-long effort in favor of political theater pre-ordained to reach a preconceived and false result,” Cipollone’s 12-page letter said. Here is more reporting from Reuters: The documents requested relate to everything from the contents of Trump’s meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin to his communications with former White House counsel Donald McGahn, the firing of former White House national security advisor Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, and possible pardons for Trump associates who pleaded guilty to crimes stemming from the probe. The committee also seeks documents aimed at probing whether Trump has used the White House to enrich himself in violation of the Constitution’s emoluments clause. In his 448-page redacted report released last month, Mueller described numerous links between Trump*s 2016 presidential campaign and various Russians but concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish that the campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Moscow. Jameela Jamil, formerly a presenter on BBC Radio 1 and now one of the stars of the sitcom The Good Place, opened up about an abortion she had when she was young. Jamila called it the “best decision I have ever made.” The Trump administration announced today it would delay tariffs on cars from Europe, a decision which was to be decided by May 18. Now, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would travel to Beijing to continue trade talks with China. “My expectation is that we will go to Beijing at some point in the near future to continue those discussions,” said Mnuchin in a U.S. Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, according to Reuters. “We’re continuing discussions. There’s still a lot of work to do.” More on the decision here, from the Guardian business liveblog. Yesterday, a top British general contradicted US intelligence reports about increased, but vague, threats from Iran. A story in the New York Times argues talk of increased threats from Iran are meant to draw Iran into an “armed conflict” with the US. While Alabama’s Republican Governor considers whether to sign the state’s near-total abortion ban, abortion providers in Ohio have formally filed a lawsuit against an abortion ban there. Lawmakers in Ohio enacted a law which bans abortion after six weeks, called a “fetal heartbeat” bill. At six weeks, a pregnancy is called an embryo, and the still microscopic tissues which will become the heart have not fully formed. When lawmakers enacted the law, they acknowledged it was unlikely to ever go into effect, but was instead meant to challenge Roe versus Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion in the US. “If a woman is forced to continue a pregnancy against her will, it can pose a risk to her physical, mental, and emotional health, as well as to the stability and well-being of her family, including existing children,” the lawsuit said, according to the AP. With both chambers of the Alabama legislature passing a near-total abortion ban, attention is going to turn to Republican Governor Kay Ivey, who must sign the bill for it to become law. The law has no exemptions for rape or incest, and criminalizes doctors who perform the procedure. Anti-abortion campaigners hope the law will be challenged in court, and eventually prompt the US Supreme Court to reconsider Roe versus Wade. Abortion remains legal in all 50 states as long as Roe versus Wade stands. Here is more reporting from the AP: Abortion rights advocates Wednesday morning urged Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey to reject the bill and vowed swift legal action if it is enacted. “We are laser-focused on urging Gov. Kay Ivey to veto this dangerous bill. If she chooses not to, then we will take this to court and ensure that abortion remains safe and legal and accessible in the state of Alabama,” said Staci Fox, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast. Ivey has not commented on the bill but the Republican fixture in Alabama has long identified as anti-abortion and the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Terri Collins, said she expects her to sign the legislation. ...“Roe v. Wade has ended the lives of millions of children,” Alabama Republican Sen. Clyde Chambliss said in a statement. “While we cannot undo the damage that decades of legal precedence under Roe have caused, this bill has the opportunity to save the lives of millions of unborn children.” Democrats criticized the bill as a mixture of political grandstanding and a waste of taxpayer dollars. “The state of Alabama ought to be ashamed of herself. You ought to be ashamed. Go look in the mirror,” Sen. Bobby Singleton said “Women in this state didn’t deserve this. This is all about political grandstanding.” Trump returned to one of his favorite topics during this speech: the southern border. With an assist from Guardian US reporter Amanda Holpuch, we are fact-checking his statements. Trump: The “wrong people [are] being allowed to come in” over the Southern border, and that sanctuary cities are “deadly”. More context... While 310,531 people were apprehended trying to cross the southern border illegally in 2017, in the same year more than 600,000 people who entered the US legally by air or sea overstayed their visas and remained in the country at the end of the year, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This is a tiny fraction of the 52 million people who entered the US legally in 2017. It is estimated that the number of visa overstays are actually higher, because the DHS report does not include land crossings. Trump: “I don’t think most countries are giving us their finest,” he added. Actually... The share of families are coming over the border has increased steadily since 2012, many of whom are refugees from violent countries. Here is one advocate Jorge Santos from Udefegua, which monitors attacks against journalists: “There’s a growing feeling that there is little possibility of a dignified life in Guatemala which is producing the increased flow of migrants and refugees.” President Trump just brought the family of California police officer Corporal Ronil Singh up to the microphone to speak, through Secret Service barricades. “Every family sitting out here wants justice,” said his widow, holding his 10-month-old son, “And that’s what I want for my husband.” Trump has said the perpetrators of ambushes on police should, “get the death penalty”, to cheers. “The ongoing attacks on our police must end,” Trump said. The trials of perpetrators should “go fast,” and added “fair but fast.” Trump is now speaking about police officers killed in the line of duty. Two of those officers are Brookhaven, Mississippi police officers who were shot in January, Corporal Zach Moak and Patrolman James White. “This morning we are honored to be joined by the families of both of these remarkable officers,” he said. The White House will not sign onto the “Christchurch call to action”, an international agreement to combat online extremism and hate speech. This is the statement from the White House, from the Washington Post: We continue to be proactive in our efforts to counter terrorist content online while also continuing to respect freedom of expression and freedom of the press,” the White House said. “Further, we maintain that the best tool to defeat terrorist speech is productive speech, and thus we emphasize the importance of promoting credible, alternative narratives as the primary means by which we can defeat terrorist messaging.” Trump has often been criticized for retweeting conspiracy theories and alt-right personalities who boost white supremacy. Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden just tweeted about the near-total abortion ban passed by Alabama’s Senate Tuesday night. His comment is notable for two reasons. 1. Many Democratic candidates tweeted about this last night. It took him many hours longer to denounce the near-total ban. (This reporter is working on a full list of 2020 contender reactions right now.) 2. Biden has an inconsistent record on abortion. He is a Catholic, and at times, has voted in favor of restrictions, other times against them. Trump and members of his cabinet are now listening to the National Anthem. Trump is flanked by Attorney General Bill Barr and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, among others. President Trump has just entered the National Peace Officer’s Memorial Service. Again, here is the livestream. Democratic US presidential candidate and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand heads to Georgia tomorrow to rally against near-total abortion bans. Roughly one week ago, Georgia joined five other states in enacting a ban on abortion after six-weeks. The laws effectively ban all abortion, since most women do not yet know they are pregnant at six weeks. Georgia’s law makes exceptions for rape and incest, but other similar laws do not – for example in Ohio. From our story on the legislators who passed Alabama’s abortion ban: Alabama’s new law mandating an almost blanket ban on abortion, the strictest in the United States, was passed by this group of exclusively white, male politicians. The Alabama law will disproportionately affect black and poor women, because they are more likely to seek abortions, and less likely to have resources to obtain an abortion out-of-state. Of the 27 Republicans, all white men, that dominate the 35-seat Alabama senate, 25 voted to pass the bill late on Tuesday. This is what the Republican leadership group in the senate looks like, as presented on their caucus’s website: President Trump is expected to speak any moment at the 39th Annual National Peace Officers’ Memorial Service – we will be watching live. Here is a link to the livestream if you want to watch it with us. Wisconsin’s legislature could be the next state to pass abortion restrictions as soon as today. The state legislature is now poised to pass the so-called “born alive” bill touted by President Trump, although the governor of that state promised to veto the bill. More reporting from the AP here: The moves in Wisconsin come as anti-abortion politicians and activists feel emboldened by the addition of conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court. They hope to ignite legal fights and eventually overturn the landmark 1973 decision Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion. Alabama lawmakers on Tuesday night approved a bill that would ban nearly all abortions. And Missouri’s Republican-led Senate was taking up a bill Wednesday that would ban abortions after the eighth week of pregnancy, which is similar to so-called fetal heartbeat laws enacted by Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio and Georgia. Wisconsin already bans abortions 20 weeks after fertilization, except in cases in which the mother’s life is in danger. This is well before the generally accepted age of viability, which the Supreme Court said in Roe v. Wade is between 24 weeks and 28 weeks. Wisconsin also has a law passed in 1849 that bans abortions and would take effect if Roe v. Wade is overturned. The bill before the Wisconsin Assembly on Wednesday addresses the extremely rare occurrence in which a baby is born alive during a failed abortion attempt. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded just 143 instances nationwide in which live births resulted from at least 9.3 million abortion attempts between 2003 and 2014. There is no comparable data in Wisconsin because state officials don’t track it. ... The Assembly was also voting on three other abortion-related bills. The others would cut off Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, prohibit abortions based on the fetus’ race, sex or defects and require providers to tell women seeking abortions using the drug mifepristone that the process may be reversed after the first dose. Amnesty International UK has just released a statement about Alabama’s abortion ban bill calling it “horrifying,” and “no better” than the current law in Northern Ireland. Here is Amnesty International UK’s Northern Ireland campaign manager Grainne Teggart: It’s devastating news that Alabama has become the latest in a string of US states to enact a horrifying abortion ban. The roll-back on reproductive rights in the US is happening at a terrifyingly rapid rate. We should be outraged by this, but let’s also remember that in the UK we’re no better – women in Northern Ireland are subjected to one of the most severe abortion bans in the world which also carries criminal penalties of up to life imprisonment. It’s shameful that that our government is allowing such a violation of reproductive rights to continue to blight the lives of so many. The UK government’s silence on the situation in Northern Ireland is putting the UK in the same camp as those US states pushing women’s reproductive health back into the dark ages. We should be leading on this issue, not lagging behind. We call on the Government to stop ignoring the cruel reality of our law and urgently legislate for change so that the harm caused is brought to an end.” Former US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton just tweeted her opposition to the Alabama bill. It is common to see abortion restrictions in the US – for the last two decades abortion opponents have been very effective at gradually restricting where, when and how a woman can obtain one. But at least one state has sought to protect abortion – New York. Here is more from the Guardian’s view on abortion: protecting a human right. At this grim time there are signs of hope. New York state has sought to bolster abortion rights this year. Chile somewhat eased its ban in 2017. And last year’s landslide vote in favour of repealing Ireland’s near-total ban resonated worldwide. Nine more US states are considering anti-abortion legislation similar to that just passed in Alabama. Bills have so far passed one chamber in Louisiana, Missouri, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to Guardian reporter Jason Wilson. Others have been introduced to statehouses in Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Texas and West Virginia without yet facing votes. Democratic US presidential candidates have condemned Alabama’s abortion ban. Here is what they said about the bill: As well, here are statements from US Democratic presidential candidates Cory Booker, Jay Inslee and Julián Castro. A federal court in Mississippi is scheduled to hear the first arguments against a six-week abortion ban in that state, brought by the state’s last remaining abortion clinic, Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The judge hearing the case struck down a 15-week abortion ban in November 2018, saying it “unequivocally” violated a woman’s right to reproductive autonomy. Abortion remains legal in all 50 US states while civil rights groups challenge abortion bans. Why has Alabama passed such a strict abortion ban? Anti-abortion campaigners hope the bill will challenge the 1973 US Supreme Court case which legalized abortion, Roe versus Wade. Guardian US reporter Erin Durkin brought us these comments from one of the architects of the ban in Montgomery, Alabama, state Representative Rich Wingo: It goes after Roe directly... We’re going in the front door and we’re saying to the supreme court, please explain to us how this isn’t a person. With modern technology, with everything that we know, this child needs to be protected under the US constitution.” Although anti-abortion campaigners often reference changes in medical technology for their abortion restrictions, the real change has been in the US Supreme Court, where the Trump administration successfully confirmed two conservative justices. The bill still needs to be signed by Alabama’s Republican governor. Because Roe versus Wade remains in effect, abortion is still legal in all 50 states even as states enact bans. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian’s politics liveblog. Last night, Alabama passed the nation’s strictest abortion ban, outlawing the procedure for women and making it a criminal offense for physicians, except in cases where the woman faces fatal complications. The bill still must be signed by the state’s Republican governor before it becomes law. Civil rights groups have already promised a lawsuit. The bill is part of a wave of new legislation from Republican-led states. Anti-abortion campaigners hope they will reach the US supreme court and challenge Roe versus Wade, the 1973 decision which legalized abortion. Here’s what else is happening today: President Trump is expected to speak at the Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service at 11am ET. Donald Trump Jr, the president’s eldest son, agreed to testify in a closed-door interview with the Senate Intelligence committee. One of the first female Native American lawmakers in Congress is defying Trump’s push to drill for oil on public lands."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/16/the-war-on-coal-is-over-coal-lost","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"The war on coal is over.

Coal lost.","bodyText":"Last week, Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announced, “the war on coal is over.” If there ever was a war on coal, the coal industry has lost. According to a new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists, many old American coal power plants are being retired or converted to natural gas, and new coal power plants aren’t being built because they’ve become more expensive than natural gas, wind, and solar energy: The share of US electricity coming from coal fell from 51 percent in 2008 to 31 percent in 2016—an unprecedented change. New UCS analysis finds that, of the coal units that remain, roughly one in four plans to retire or convert to natural gas; another 17 percent are uneconomic and could face retirement soon. Natural gas has now surpassed coal to supply 32% of US electricity (up from 21% in 2008), and solar and wind are up to 10% (from 3% in 2008). This trend will continue. As old coal plants continue to retire and be replaced by cheaper renewables and natural gas, their share of the US electricity supply will continue to plummet, and coal will become a fossil fuel in every sense of the word. That’s why American companies continue to invest in cheap, clean renewable energy. As a result, our air and water are becoming cleaner, Americans are becoming healthier, and our carbon pollution is falling. The shift away from coal poses a challenge for regions in which the local economy depends on the fossil fuel, but the transition is inevitable. A wise economic policy would involve funding programs to help those regions adapt to the change (Hillary Clinton proposed one such plan during her presidential campaign). A recent study showed that Americans are willing to pay a carbon tax with some of the revenue going to assist displaced coal workers. The Trump administration has instead opted to try and slow coal’s inevitable decline. Trump is desperate to burn more coal The Trump administration seems hell-bent on causing as much global warming as possible. First there was the historically irresponsible decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, joining war-torn Syria as the only world countries to reject the treaty. Then just a few weeks ago, Trump’s Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced a plan to effectively take coal out of the free market and instead subsidize it with taxpayer dollars to bail out the industry and keep uneconomical coal power plants open. The hypocrisy ran thick – as Perry called for propping up the coal industry with increased taxpayer subsidies, Pruitt called for an end to subsidies for renewable energy: I would do away with these incentives that we give to wind and solar. I’d let them stand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas and other sources, and let utilities make real-time market decisions on those types of things as opposed to being propped up by tax incentives and other types of credits that occur Soon thereafter, Priutt announced that Trump’s EPA will repeal the Clean Power Plan. That policy represented America’s most significant effort to cut its carbon pollution, but had been mired in a legal battle over whether the plan exceeded EPA’s regulatory authority under the Clean Air Act. Rather than let the courts decide the case, which many experts felt the EPA would win, Pruitt stopped defending the case in court and ended the program. The problem is that according to the US Supreme Court, the EPA is legally required to regulate dangerous carbon pollution. Pruitt’s EPA may propose a dramatically weakened plan that probably wouldn’t survive a court challenge, or he may just try to run out the clock on Trump’s term. As with the disastrous Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they don’t have a replacement plan. In the meantime, states and environmental groups will take his Clean Power Plan repeal to court. Pruitt’s Clean Power Plan repeal justification is largely based on bogus economics, which the Trump administration is using to reduce government estimates of the ‘social cost of carbon.’ This figure – which estimates how much a ton of carbon pollution costs society in terms of damages caused by climate change – is integral to many government policies. A majority of economists think the government’s estimate is too low, but Pruitt’s EPA manipulated the math by ignoring the costs of America’s carbon pollution to the rest of the world, and by using a high discount rate, which essentially says we care more about saving money now than preventing climate damages and suffering for future generations. However, because renewables and natural gas are now cheaper than coal, an analysis by the Rhodium Group found that the US will meet the Clean Power Plan target of cutting carbon pollution from electricity generation 32% below 2005 levels by 2030 despite its repeal. That being said, with the Clean Power Plan in place, the US likely would have beat its targets. As this excellent tool created by Carbon Brief shows, many states like California and Idaho are ahead of the curve, but other states like Texas and West Virginia would have been forced to accelerate their transitions to clean energy, had the Clean Power Plan been enforced. The ball is in Congress’ court The good news is that none of the Trump administration’s moves are permanent. The next president can rejoin the Paris climate agreement, have the EPA draft new rules to regulate power plant carbon pollution, and revise the social cost of carbon based on real science and math. As Citizens’ Climate Lobby Executive Director Mark Reynolds wrote: Those who cheer the EPA’s move should remember that President Obama initiated the Clean Power Plan in 2015 in the face of Congress’s inaction on climate change. Without effective legislation to combat climate change, a future president could just as easily go down the path of executive action and regulations again. The best answer here is for Congress to pass legislation putting the market to work on solving climate change. There’s been some movement in this direction. A group of Republican elder statesmen in the Climate Leadership Council called for a revenue-neutral carbon tax, which would grow the economy. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) recently called for a price on carbon pollution and is said to be working with Senator Whitehouse (D-RI) on climate legislation. The House Climate Solutions Caucus is now up to 30 Republican and 30 Democratic members and is trying to craft a bipartisan replacement for the Clean Power Plan. The Trump administration is taking every possible step to burn away our future, but fortunately the transition to a clean energy economy is unstoppable, and many of his party members are coming to grips with that reality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/aug/02/leslie-jesch-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-02T13:46:32Z","webTitle":"Leslie Jesch obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/02/leslie-jesch-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/aug/02/leslie-jesch-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Leslie Jesch obituary","bodyText":"My father, Leslie Jesch, who has died aged 90, was a leading authority on the application of solar energy and a pioneer in the development of renewables internationally, and especially across Europe. He was born László Jesch in Budapest, the son of László Jesch, an electrical engineer and college principal, and his wife Ilona (nee Láng), who before she married had supported her large family by making the popular Hungarian food tarhonya, a sort of egg-based pasta. From the Benedictine monks who educated him he developed a deep appreciation of European history and culture, and he learned several languages. He graduated in engineering from university in Budapest and married Katalin Fekete, a research chemist, in 1953. After the Hungarian uprising of 1956, we crossed the border on a winter’s night to Austria where, as refugees, we were welcomed and looked after. We eventually settled in Pennsylvania, where Leslie used his expertise in thermodynamics and heat transfer in various jobs in industry. After an MSc from the University of Pennsylvania (1962), Leslie did a PhD in mechanical engineering at the University of Leeds (1970), supervised by Prof Derek Bradley, whom he had first met at a youth congress in Hungary. The PhD brought about a change of both career and country when he took up a lectureship in mechanical engineering at the University of Birmingham. My mother and I moved with him and eventually we all became British citizens. At Birmingham, Leslie developed his expertise in solar energy (he also dabbled in wind energy, a result of his passion for kite-flying) and set up a solar energy laboratory, which thrived and attracted PhD students from all over the world. Realising its potential, Leslie became active in the International Solar Energy Society, becoming its vice-president and receiving a special service award from the UK branch in 1999. He stimulated many European collaborations through ISES-Europe, of which he became president. He set up the Franklin Company, which provided consultancy in solar energy systems, and edited and published several solar journals, notably Sun at Work in Europe, giving work and a launch pad to many of his students. Leslie also wrote a monograph (Solar Energy Today, 1981) and a range of technical papers. In Birmingham, my parents lived in Rowheath Solar Village in Bournville, which he had helped to design. In retirement, they pursued their lifelong interests in theatre, concerts and travelling, and their garden parties were legendary. Leslie is survived by my mother Katherine, who like him anglicised her name when in the US, and myself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/apr/03/renewables-cut-europes-carbon-emissions-by-10-in-2015-says-eea","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-03T14:05:39Z","webTitle":"Renewables cut Europe's carbon emissions by 10% in 2015, says EEA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/03/renewables-cut-europes-carbon-emissions-by-10-in-2015-says-eea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/apr/03/renewables-cut-europes-carbon-emissions-by-10-in-2015-says-eea","fields":{"headline":"Renewables cut Europe's carbon emissions by 10% in 2015, says EEA","bodyText":"A surge in the use of wind and solar energy helped Europe to cut its fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by about 10% in 2015, an authoritative new report has found. Energy use from renewables rose to 16.7% of Europe’s total, up from 15% in 2013, and accounted for 77% of the continent’s new power capacity. But the clean energy burst is still not moving fast enough to prevent a “lock-in” of already-commissioned fossil fuel capacity, which will otherwise transform into stranded assets. It was also unevenly spread across Europe, with renewables expanding to take up 30% of the power load in many Scandinavian countries, but only 5% in Malta. The UK had Europe’s seventh best record for the intensity of its greenhouse gasemissions, but was a mid-table performer in terms of emissions per capita, according to figures compiled by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Mihai Tomescu, who authored the EEA study, said Europe’s renewable roll-out was accelerating, but not fast enough to halt global warming at 2C. “The current level of effort needs to be stepped up and this is not necessarily going to happen without additional focus,” he told the Guardian. The EEA’s report suggests that the EU is broadly on track to achieve its goals of 20% emissions cuts and 20% renewable energy share by 2020. But a more challenging target for 2050 – of reducing emissions by at least 80% – will require acceleration after 2030, when tough decisions about phasing out internal combustion engines and oil supplies will have to be taken. James Watson, the chief executive of SolarPower Europe, which represents Europe’s solar photovoltaic industry, said that today’s figures were in line with a 50GW spike in global solar capacity last year. “This is a good start and we must be positive about that but if we are truly to meet our obligations under the Paris agreement, we will need to see a much faster growth of renewables and a commensurate, much faster reduction of fossil fuels, and coal power in particular,” he said. Renewables have replaced 100m tonnes of oil equivalent electricity generation this decade, but will only need to replace 20m tonnes in the 10 years ahead, according to SolarPower Europe’s analysis. Tomescu noted that Europe’s growth in renewable energy was already coinciding with a drop in fossil fuel consumption. “In broad terms, we are talking about a substitution and this has an impact not only on import dependency but also avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/apr/20/renewables-roadshow-how-the-people-of-newtown-got-behind-solar-powered-beer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-19T21:13:40Z","webTitle":"Renewables roadshow: how the people of Newtown got behind solar-powered beer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/20/renewables-roadshow-how-the-people-of-newtown-got-behind-solar-powered-beer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/apr/20/renewables-roadshow-how-the-people-of-newtown-got-behind-solar-powered-beer","fields":{"headline":"Renewables roadshow: how the people of Newtown got behind solar-powered beer","bodyText":"Newtown – Sydney’s grungy inner-city suburb where a seemingly endless string of Thai restaurants is interrupted by body-piercing shops, clothes stores and a growing number of small bars. It’s a suburb known for its beer-fuelled nightlife and alternative cultural tastes. It’s also one of the most progressive areas in Australia: at the last New South Wales election, the Greens got more than 45% of the primary vote (and almost 60% after preferences) in the seat of Newtown. It makes sense, then, that beer and progressive environmental politics would come together in this suburb and, right in the middle of Newtown, a community-owned solar array is powering a local brewery. “Solar-powered beer tastes better,” says Oscar McMahon with a laugh. He is the cofounder of Young Henrys, a small local beer company whose brewery is now home to the solar array, which is owned by members of the Newtown community. NSW has become one of the worst states for driving the transition to renewable energy, so Newtown locals have taken matters into their own hands. The groups involved in the project – the brewery owners, the local investors, supporters in the NSW state parliament and the community energy provider Pingala – each have their own overlapping reasons to buy-in. McMahon is the epitome of the Newtown variety of hipster. Standing among the fermenters, he has an impressive amount of tattoos protruding from his black sleeveless shirt and a full long beard that would make any biker jealous. He and Richard Adamson began their business in a small warehouse space in Newtown in 2012. “We had a brewery that could produce 1200 litres at the time and we were generally selling about 5-10 kegs a week at the beginning,” McMahon says. “Five years later, we’ve got a much more efficient, bigger brewery. We now have five warehouses. We have sales people all over the country and we are selling nationally to about 300 different venues.” The idea for the business came out of a beer appreciation club they both attended. McMahon says the pair wanted to “create a brewery that is as in contact with the people that drink the beer as beer club is”. They have maintained that ethos by having a small restaurant or bar at each of their brewing locations and hand-picking the venues that sell their beer. They see the community solar project on their roof as another way to be in close contact with the community around them. “We are buying our power from people that have invested in an idea and infrastructure within our business,” he says. “The benefits are that you open yourself up to other people that believe in your company to actually buy in.” Adamson, McMahon’s business partner, thinks much of the local enthusiasm springs from the living situations of those who live there. “A lot of people who live in Newtown either rent or they live in apartments. They don’t really have the opportunity to access solar energy,” Adamson says. “This way they get to participate and know that at least some of the electricity being used in the area is being generated by solar.” Local state member Jenny Leong has been a supporter of the Pingala Young Henrys project from the start. So much so that hers was one of the 54 names drawn out of a hat with 300 names in it, allowing her to invest money personally in the project. “What we see here is the community stepping in and filling the gap that is completely left open by the fact that we have no leadership from our national or state governments when it comes to really addressing the issue of pollution and really moving us away from polluting fossil fuel industries,” she says. Indeed federal energy policy has been left in tatters after a decade of inaction on climate change. Investment in new electricity generation has stalled while many of the country’s old coal-powered generators are poised to close. Consequently official government projections show greenhouse gas emissions are rising and will continue to do so to 2030. This means there is no hope of achieving the cuts in emissions Australia promised to make when they signed up to the Paris agreement in 2015. Meanwhile, the lack of certainty for energy businesses has meant investment in energy generation has frozen, directly causing prices to jump and adding more than the cost of a $50 per tonne carbon price to wholesale energy prices. The ACT, Victoria and South Australia have moved ahead in this area but NSW has been slow to build their own renewable energy policy. In 2016 they announced a goal of having zero net emissions by 2050, which would require a lot of renewable energy generation, yet how that would be achieved has not been clearly spelled out. Leong says a project like this shows the community taking action, and moving forward without the politicians. “Newtown is an electorate that is made up of some of the most wonderfully progressive people in the country, who want to see a real shift towards genuine protection of our planet and our environment from pollution.” Pingala installed the brewery’s solar array and organised the ownership structure. The 29.9kW array is owned by 54 locals (including Leong), who will get 5%-8% return on their investment each year. The brewery sources a big chunk of its electricity from a totally renewable source, while paying about the same for its electricity. At the end of 10 years, the locals will have made a profit on their investment and the solar array will be gifted to the brewery, who will continue to use it to generate free energy for another decade or longer. The Young Henry’s installation is the first project that Pingala has organised but they expect it to be the first of many. “We spent a long time developing our business models and building a community base,” says April Crawford-Smith, a convenor of the four-year-old community energy organisation. Their next step is to replicate the installation at other locations around Sydney. “We have amazing plans for the future, doing a similar project again on other breweries as well as looking at apartments and schools. And we have also looked at remote Aboriginal communities and energy affordability and solar as well,” Crawford-Smith says. “So we have a pretty broad remit. “It’s very ambitious but at the very heart of it is community and them driving forward solutions for our environment and our society.” For some at Pingala, the project of building community renewable energy is also about social justice. Pingala coordinator Tom Nockolds wants the public to own the sources of their own energy, taking it away from big business, and putting the profits and other benefits into the hands of the public. “Community ownership of renewable energy is so important because we are in the midst of an amazing energy transition. It’s no longer a question of if it’s going to happen, it’s happening all around us,” Nockolds says. “The real question is are we going to take advantage of the opportunity to build fairer systems in the way our energy systems are structured?” Leong believes her electorate of Newtown is the ideal place for the transition to begin. “The wonderful local feeling that is appreciated by so many in Newtown is to have a locally brewed beer powered by solar energy and linked to an incredible community initiative and a cooperative structure,” she says. “What could be better than solar powered beer?.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/jul/24/-solar-energy-tea-party-beliefs-not-despite-them","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-24T11:30:04Z","webTitle":"I support solar energy because of my Tea Party beliefs — not despite them | Debbie Dooley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/-solar-energy-tea-party-beliefs-not-despite-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/-solar-energy-tea-party-beliefs-not-despite-them","fields":{"headline":"I support solar energy because of my Tea Party beliefs — not despite them","bodyText":"I am a lifelong conservative and, also, a strong advocate for solar energy. As I travel the country advocating for solar using a free-market message, I am seeing an awakening among conservatives in this area. There are many areas that conservatives and progressives strongly disagree on, but both are united in a desire to pass on a legacy of true energy independence to future generations of Americans. The right to solar energy is an American issue – not a partisan one. America was founded on the principles of liberty and freedom, but unfortunately in many states there are regulatory barriers erected by the government that prohibits the freedom of choice for utility customers – especially when it comes to switching to solar. Most electric power companies have been granted monopoly status by virtue of legislation that grants these companies the exclusive right to sell electric power in their territory. They have a perfect setup in their business model. They have a government-assigned customer base whom they are able to bill for capital investments, thereby making a guaranteed profit. The more new power plants cost, the more money they make. The average consumer can now, in theory, install solar panels on their rooftops. Solar prices have plummeted in recent years and solar is now cost effective. But there are too many penalties in place that punish consumers who want to switch to solar. For example, in Florida a property tax is added that makes solar uncompetitive to the monopolies. Net Metering allows solar users to sell excess power generated back to the grid and recover the costs of their solar panels much faster. But in states like Wisconsin, the monopolies pay wholesale rate and not retail rate. This is very unfair to solar users because they are prohibited from selling excess power to anyone other than the monopolies. This amounts to prohibiting competition from rooftop solar and denying consumers the freedom to choose. We should all experience the freedom that comes from generating our own power and should have the right to sell the excess power generated on our private property. That would unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans, drive innovation and also create jobs in a stagnate economy. But monopolies want to prevent that from happening. Industry trade group Edison Electric Institute deceptively claimed in a report that if solar users buy less power then non-solar users will see an increase in their power bills to make up for the loss of revenue. This is similar to a hospital seeking to ban fitness clubs because the members would be healthy and therefore need fewer visits to the hospital. There is a big battle brewing in Florida over the freedom to choose. Conservatives and progressives have come together to fight for free-market principles in energy. They are pushing for a Constitutional amendment that would provide Floridians the choice to purchase solar-generated electricity from a non-utility solar provider – up to 2 megawatts in size. This gives Florida’s families and businesses the right to freely engage in commerce of solar power and take greater control of their energy future. That does not sit well with companies like Florida Power and Light (FPL) and other electric companies, who have turned to their close allies like Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and James Taylor of Heartland Institute to keep Floridians shackled to these powerful monopolies. FPL has even hatched an alternative solar ballot initiative intended to confuse voters and derail the Floridians for Solar Choice ballot initiative. Conservatives are out front fighting back against the covert attempts at deception by FPL and its allies. We polled 600 Florida registered voters in October of 2014. Our polling data showed that 71% of Florida Republican Primary voters support third-party sales of solar power. Our message is winning. Free-market principles are cherished by conservatives, and they don’t like the unrestricted power granted to these powerful monopolies by the government. If you show conservatives that solar is the perfect vehicle to advance competition in energy, you would be surprised at just how receptive they are. My home state of Georgia is a very “red” state but solar is flourishing there, recently ranked at the top for creating new solar jobs. The big surprise is that solar has advanced because of the leadership of conservative Republican elected officials like “Bubba” McDonald and Representative Michael Dudgeon. Georgia just passed a third-party solar bill that sailed through the legislature without one dissenting vote. That’s quite an accomplishment in this day of partisanship."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/sep/14/entrepreneurs-turn-carbon-dioxide-into-fuels-artificial-photosynthesis","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T10:13:02Z","webTitle":"The entrepreneurs turning carbon dioxide into fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/sep/14/entrepreneurs-turn-carbon-dioxide-into-fuels-artificial-photosynthesis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/sep/14/entrepreneurs-turn-carbon-dioxide-into-fuels-artificial-photosynthesis","fields":{"headline":"The entrepreneurs turning carbon dioxide into fuels","bodyText":"In an industrial greenhouse about 30km from Zurich, plump aubergines and juicy cherry tomatoes are ripening to perfection. Growing Mediterranean crops in Switzerland would traditionally be energy intensive but these vegetables are very nearly carbon-neutral. The greenhouse uses waste energy from a nearby refuse plant, and carbon dioxide from the world’s first commercial direct air capture plant. The facility, designed by Zurich-based start-up Climeworks, pumps the gas into greenhouses to boost the plants’ photosynthesis and increase their yield, it hopes, by up to 20%. Climeworks says it will extract around 900 tonnes of CO2 a year from the air. The company’s end game is not plumper tomatoes but something far more ambitious – proving that carbon dioxide can be recycled from the atmosphere and turned into something useful. If this installation is a success, Climeworks wants to sell its concentrated carbon dioxide to companies producing carbon-neutral hydrocarbon fuels. With concentrations of CO2 at their highest in the last 400,000 years, the world needs to remove the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere – as well as cut emissions – if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change. Of course, nature has been recycling carbon dioxide for millions of years. Photosynthesis turns sunlight, carbon dioxide and water into sugars which fuel plants, which provide us with food, wood and complex sugars for fuel. But most plants turn less than 1% of the solar energy they receive into useful energy-rich compounds. Scientists and entrepreneurs are working on technologies that they hope will improve on nature and make recycling carbon dioxide a profitable industry. The World Economic Forum and Scientific American recently named an artificial leaf as one of the top emerging technologies of 2017. Dan Nocera, a chemist at Harvard University, is one of the scientists working on developing this “leaf”, which looks like a small, plain computer chip. Nocera’s leaf has an energy efficiency of around 10%, according to his paper published last year in Science, a peer-reviewed academic journal. It has two processes. The first is an electrochemical system that uses metal catalysts and electricity from solar panels to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Then the hydrogen, along with carbon dioxide, is fed to bacteria commonly found in soil and water. The bacteria convert the gases into alcohols like methanol and ethanol that are the precursors to liquid fuels. These “solar fuels” – so called because they are made from nothing more than sunlight, water and air – could be a carbon neutral drop-in replacement for today’s fossil fuels. Nocera’s ultimate vision is a cheap, standalone solar-powered system for developing countries to turn water into fuel for vehicles, cooking or power generation. His initial target market is India, where he hopes local scientists and entrepreneurs will help to commercialise the system, although he admits that his technology is years from commercialisation. In the meantime, several start-ups are trying to beat Nocera to a practical system to recycle CO2 into useful products. Like Nocera’s leaf, all are designed to run on a trickle of electricity from solar panels. In 2015, Staff Sheehan left Yale University and founded Catalytic Innovations to use metal catalysts like Nocera’s to turn carbon dioxide and water into ethanol, a biofuel that is already added to petrol in many countries to reduce its carbon footprint. Another start-up, Opus 12, recently spun out of Stanford University in Silicon Valley says it’s “recreating photosynthesis, but at warp speed”. The company says its tech can be used at any source of CO2 emissions to produce syngas. This mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be burned like natural gas or used to produce a range of industrial chemicals. And at the annual American Chemical Society meeting in Washington DC last month, a small company called Dioxide Materials said that it had developed electrolysis technology that could split carbon dioxide into oxygen and carbon monoxide – a precursor for methanol – with twice the efficiency of previous systems. In order for CO2 recycling systems to operate efficiently, however, the gas has to be captured and concentrated from sources such as factories and power stations – or extracted from the air using a system like Climeworks’. And that isn’t cheap. Capturing CO2 at a factory chimney could cost up to $80 per ton, according to research from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Extracting from thin air is pricier still. Climeworks says it currently costs around $600 to extract a ton of CO2, although it expects that price to halve in its second-generation plant. “Technologies to capture CO2 from the air, like Climeworks’ units, have the potential for the sort of steep price declines that we’ve seen from solar, wind, and batteries, which are also factory manufactured products,” says Matt Lucas of the Center for Carbon Removal, a non-profit dedicated to curtailing climate change. “But if we want to compete with gasoline,” says Sheehan, “that cost has to be practically nothing.” There are a couple of dozen large-scale projects underway to capture and store carbon dioxide from industrial facilities, including a pilot in India turning CO2 into baking soda. However, the International Energy Agency says they are not on track to meet its objective for more than 100 projects by 2020. Another challenge is the swift change in the political climate. “Traditionally, solar-fuelled artificial photosynthesis has been a government-funded effort,” says Dick Co, director of the Solar Fuels Institute, a global team of scientists working to recycle CO2 into fuels. “But accelerated by the US election last year, we’re seeing a quick shift from government money to philanthropists like Bill Gates and Tom Steyer.” It’s unknown whether these philanthropists will be committed to funding solar fuels over the years and decades they will need to reach commercial reality. For young companies like Catalytic Innovations, that means seeking out every source of funding. Sheehan’s start-up has made it to the semi-finals of the NRG Cosia Carbon XPrize, a $20m competition to recycle waste carbon dioxide from power plants into valuable fuel or building materials. He is now looking for money to build a larger prototype in the hope of making it to the final round – which would come with half a million dollars seed money."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"technology/2017/mar/10/elon-musk-i-can-fix-south-australia-power-network-in-100-days-or-its-free","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-10T05:04:40Z","webTitle":"Elon Musk: I can fix South Australia power network in 100 days or it's free","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/10/elon-musk-i-can-fix-south-australia-power-network-in-100-days-or-its-free","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/mar/10/elon-musk-i-can-fix-south-australia-power-network-in-100-days-or-its-free","fields":{"headline":"Elon Musk: I can fix South Australia power network in 100 days or it's free","bodyText":"Elon Musk, the billionaire co-founder of electric car giant Tesla, has thrown down a challenge to the South Australian and federal governments, saying he can solve the state’s energy woes within 100 days – or he’ll deliver the 100MW battery storage system for free. On Thursday, Lyndon Rive, Tesla’s vice-president for energy products, told the AFR the company could install the 100-300 megawatt hours of battery storage that would be required to prevent the power shortages that have been causing price spikes and blackouts in the state. Thanks to stepped-up production out of Tesla’s new Gigafactory in Nevada, he said it could be achieved within 100 days. Mike Cannon-Brookes, the Australian co-founder of Silicon Valley startup Atlassian, on Friday tweeted Elon Musk, asking if Tesla was serious about being able to install the capacity. Musk replied that the company could do it in 100 days of the contract being signed, or else provide it free, adding: “That serious enough for you?” SA Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young replied to Musk: “Let’s talk!” Rive, Musk’s cousin who co-founded with him the solar energy outfit SolarCity, had said Tesla’s battery technology could address the power shortfall from the Hazelwood power plant closure in Victoria, as well as SA’s blackouts. “We don’t have 300MWh sitting there ready to go but I’ll make sure there are,” he told the AFR. Tesla recently completed an installation of an 80MWh grid-scale battery farm in southern California within just 90 days, which cost $100m US. Repeated blackouts in SA since September last year have sparked a political brawl over energy policy, with the federal government blaming the failures on the use of renewable technologies. The most recent blackout was in early February the Australian Energy Market Operator said there were many factors behind it, including higher demand than anticipated. Grid scale battery storage could help to even out price spikes, prevent blackouts and improve reliability across the network. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) recently approved a $450,000 grant to EnergyAustralia to investigate a pumped hydro energy storage project in the Spencer Gulf. That project has a capacity to produce about 100MW with six to eight hours of storage. In comparison, Tumut 3 hydroelectric station, Australia’s largest pumped hydro storage, has a capacity of 1,500 megawatts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2020/apr/24/australia-coronavirus-latest-updates-nsw-victoria-queensland-covid-19-testing-scott-morrison-latest-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-24T11:05:33Z","webTitle":"Fifth Covid-19 death at Sydney aged care home – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/apr/24/australia-coronavirus-latest-updates-nsw-victoria-queensland-covid-19-testing-scott-morrison-latest-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2020/apr/24/australia-coronavirus-latest-updates-nsw-victoria-queensland-covid-19-testing-scott-morrison-latest-news","fields":{"headline":"Fifth Covid-19 death at Sydney aged care home – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re closing our live coronavirus coverage for the day. Thanks from me, Graham Readfearn, and from my colleagues Josh Taylor and Amy Remeikis. You can still follow events elsewhere on the Guardian’s global live blog. We’ll be back tomorrow with more live coverage. Here’s a summary of the day: Australia’s death toll from coronavirus rose to 79. Tasmania, Western Australia and New South Wales each announced a death. New case numbers remained low and Tasmania recorded no new cases for the first time in three weeks. Newmarch House in western Sydney announced a fifth death at the aged care facility. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, warned aged care providers to loosen restrictions or face stronger regulation. Testing criteria is being broadened across the country. Community sport could be one of the earliest activities to see restrictions lifted or eased. The national cabinet is working on a set of national principles to allow that to happen. Perth airport blocked four Virgin planes from being moved because the airline owes it $16m in airfield and terminal use fees. Stay safe and thanks again for being with us. Jimmy Barnes took a night off last night, but he’s back with more music from his lounge room. It’s a cover of the 1963 Burt Bacharach and Hal David song (They Long to Be) Close to You, most famously recorded by the Carpenters in 1970. Night has fallen now across the entire continent. Usually hundreds of thousands of Australians would be up before sunrise tomorrow to join Anzac day dawn services and to honour those who serve and have served. But coronavirus means this year will be different. There won’t be any local marches or public services, but people will still be able to watch ceremonies live streamed from state RSL websites and on the ABC and other networks. But you can still take part if you choose to and RSL branches want people to still stand and remember at 6am, either in their homes, on their driveways, in their gardens or anywhere they’re allowed to go. Prof Frank Bongiorno, historian at Australian National University, wrote on the Guardian earlier today that the lack of public ceremony will represent a return to Anzac days of decades long gone. While the day has had its elements of public ritual since 1916, much early Anzac Day commemoration was private rather than public, sometimes conducted at the gravesides of Australian soldiers buried in cemeteries in Britain and Australia. Women were prominent in these efforts, honouring the memories of men they might or might not have known by placing flowers on their tombs. There are other echoes of the past. Anzac Day in 1919 was also disrupted by a major crisis in public health. In New South Wales, where the rate of infection from Spanish influenza was high and the number of deaths – approaching 1,000 by Anzac Day – was alarming, the government had banned public meetings. Several key developments emerged from the national cabinet meeting earlier today. Rules around aged care visits, hopes for a restart of community sport, clarification on jobkeeper payments and a repeat of medical advice for school classrooms all made for a busy day. My colleagues Daniel Hurst and Paul Karp have wrapped all the important details here. Australia’s total death toll from Covid-19 is now at 79 with another death confirmed an hour ago at a western Sydney aged care home. We told you about the death of a 96-year-old woman at the Newmarch House aged care facility, who was the third death confirmed today. A 79-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, died overnight in Tasmania. A man in his 70s died overnight in Western Australia. Here are the daily new case counts as confirmed by states and territories. South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have seen zero new cases. The ACT recorded 1 new case, Queensland 2, Western Australia 2, Victoria 6 and New South Wales recorded 7. Earlier today Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration issued infringement notices of $25,200 to celebrity chef Pete Evans, who claimed a fancy light box –sorry, “subtle energy platform” – could help treat coronavirus. The BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform was yours for just $14,990 from chef Pete. The president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Harry Nespolon, has some comments about the fines. This celebrity chef can carry on all he likes about ‘activated almonds’ and whatever latest fad excites him but he should steer clear of health advice, particularly when it comes to something as serious as Covid-19. I welcome this decision and I hope that it gives pause for thought for anyone taking advantage of this pandemic to spread false and misleading nonsense on social media. I encourage all Australians to ignore his social media content. Please listen to the experts including your GP, we have your best interests at heart and we are doing all we can. As I have stated previously this ‘light machine’ doesn’t do anything but drain your wallet. However, the problem is that it may lull people into a false sense of security which means they don’t act as cautiously as they otherwise would on responsibilities such as social distancing. The various interested parties in the world of broadcasting professional rugby league are creeping closer to agreement. NRL broadcasters and the Australian Rugby League Commission have been in talks this afternoon. They’ve agreed the competition will start on 28 may, but AAP reports they still haven’t agreed the structure. From AAP: NRL television broadcasters Channel Nine and Foxtel have agreed to recognise May 28 as the competition recommencement date following extensive meetings. On Friday evening, ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys confirmed to AAP that the NRL and broadcasters would finalise a competition structure early next week, as both parties want different outcomes. “We were all united on the 28th May start. But just the competition structure we need a little more time, but we definitely announce it early next week,” he said. A 96-year-old woman who had tested positive for Covid-19 has died at Newmarch House in western Sydney – the fifth death at the aged care home. Anglicare Sydney has confirmed the sad news in a statement, saying the woman had “multiple health issues”. Grant Millard, CEO of Anglicare Sydney, said: I am thankful that a close relative was able to visit her last night before she died. We grieve with the family, our staff who have cared for her, other residents who have come to know her, and everyone who has been thinking and praying for us during this difficult time. Please keep everyone in your thoughts and prayers. Schools in NSW go back next week under a model that has students in classrooms for a day a week, starting in week two. Craig Petersen, the acting president of the New South Wales Secondary Principals’ Council, is talking to the ABC. He says last night the NSW chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant gave a briefing and “it’s quite clear that the transmission rate between children is absolutely negligible”. Petersen said: That is reassuring but we also have staff to consider and we do have a number of staff in schools who are aged or have underlying health conditions so we look how we can maintain that. The logistics of returning to school is something the principals will work hard and how to cater for HSC students .... And the reality is that any staggered return to school is going to be fraught with difficulty. We are really concerned about our HSC students, this is a big year for them and we want to minimise the disruption to their education and get them back on track as soon as we can but not losing track with other students. Some colleagues are working out how to get year 12 back more often than that, maybe 4 or five days out of the week in the early stages but it will depend on the local context and what is working for the students now. So it’s been pointed out to me that when the prime minister spoke earlier today about how the four square metre distancing rule didn’t apply to classrooms, this shouldn’t be a huge surprise. Chiefly, because he has said it before – on 21 April, he said: On schools, national cabinet was keen to reinforce the point as was made last week that the health advice is not, is not, in relation to schools that a four square metre per person rule be enforced in classrooms. That is not the advice of the medical expert panel and any suggestion that this is a requirement for schools is not the case. To be fair, the PM didn’t mention the 1.5 metre social distancing rule on 21 April, and he did today. But it’s also clear that classrooms haven’t been the subject of the same health advice as other situations for some time. Sydney beaches at Coogee, Maroubra and Clovelly will open on Saturday and Sunday morning for three hours, but only if people are there to exercise. Between 6am and 9am, surfing, swimming and running is in. Hanging out and watching the world go by, isn’t. Randwick City Council said it would would reassess the situation on Monday. In a statement, the council said: All other unpatrolled beaches in Randwick City will remain closed until further notice. These beaches include Gordon’s Bay, Malabar beach, Little Bay beach, Frenchmans beach, Yarra Bay and Congwong beach. Ocean rock pools in Randwick City will remain closed until further notice as they are subject to a public health order to close. Graham Readfearn here taking you through the rest of the day in coronavirus-related news. Earlier today, home affairs minister Peter Dutton had a crack at the Queensland government, saying kids in his state should be back at school. The reason they weren’t, claimed Dutton, was because premier Annastacia Palaszczuk was “running scared of the militant” Queensland Teachers’ Union. Well, QTU president Kevin Bates has just been talking to the ABC. An announcement earlier today from the national cabinet that the 1.5 metre distancing rule should no longer apply to schools has thrown the union’s position in the air. Bates said that the union “had not formed a position” on whether there could be return to full schooling before the end of this current term, which is finishing its first week today. If you had asked me that question yesterday, I would have potentially given you a different answer, because today the 1.5m social distancing rule has just disappeared. So you know, we’ve got this roller-coaster ride of changing conditions – we’re not making a decision on this in Queensland until the end of the next fortnight. We would need to look at all of the circumstances that are in play at that time to make a good decision about what the second half of the term would look like. Bates responded to the accusation his union was running the show saying they were only one of “almost 80 people” who were meeting almost daily for stakeholder meetings with the state’s Department of Education We are one of the stakeholders, we are a major stakeholder, we represent 48,000 teachers and principals in Queensland, but our voice is not the only one and the government obviously listens to what we have to say, and then they make their own decisions. We don’t always agree with everything they decide and this is one of those cases. But we are working with the government as we look towards what might happen in the second half of the term. I am now handing over to my colleague, Graham Readfearn, to take you through the evening. Police were forced to break up a protest against 5G in Mullumbimby in NSW due to the coronavirus restrictions on public gatherings. Around 100 people, seemingly unaware of the potential dangers of contracting coronavirus in large gatherings, were incorrectly claiming that 5G can affect immunity. “Especially in this age of coronavirus, you want to have your immunity as strong as you can,” 7News reported one of the protestors saying. We’ve confirmed, as the prime minister said earlier, that Amazon Web Services will host the data from the app within Australia (Sydney area to be exact). There’s been a lot of people quite concerned about using an American company for this, because of a US law that can force US-based companies to provide data they hold, even if they’re not located there. We’ll have more on that later, but government services minister Stuart Robert has said new laws will be enacted to make it a crime for Amazon to take the data overseas. “Keeping Australian data in Australia will be guaranteed through a determination through the Biosecurity Act and legislation. It will be a criminal offence to transfer data to any country other than Australia. A penalty of imprisonment for five years and/or 300 penalty units ($63,000) could apply to breaches of the direction,” he said. “The highly secure information storage system keys will be managed through Amazon Web Services’ Key Management System (KMS), a widely used security service that has been previously assessed by the ACSC. “This is exactly the same way the Australian government already uses AWS for many other agencies, including the work of our intelligence agencies, including ASD, and ensures Australian data stays in Australia.” One point, he said, was that Australia hadn’t signed up to participate in the US Cloud Act yet – except there is currently legislation before parliament to do just that. So more to come on this. In case you forgot, avid carnivore Pete Evans was recently seen promoting this Tardis console panel-looking device as a potential treatment for coronavirus. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has now fined Evans $25,200 (or roughly the cost of 1.5 of these machines) for claiming it could be used for coronavirus treatment. The TGA found there was “no foundation” to these claims. There were two infringement notices issued. One for the coronavirus claims, and one for the other claims made for this Back to the Future-looking device, including that it could “restore strength, stamina, coordination and mental clarity”. “As the BioCharger device has been represented by the company as being for therapeutic uses, it is a therapeutic good within the meaning of the act, and is subject to the regulatory framework established under the act and administered by the TGA,” the TGA said. “Unless a specific exemption applies, therapeutic goods must be entered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) before they can be lawfully supplied or advertised in Australia.” The emergency laws that passed Victorian parliament yesterday as part of the state’s response to the coronavirus should be overseen by an independent committee, human rights commissioner Kristen HIlton has said. Hilton, who is the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commissioner, said some of the measures introduced in the Covid-19 Omnibus (Emergency Measures) Act 2020 would have an impact on human rights, particularly changes relating to the management of prisons, the restriction of visitors, and changes to the way court proceedings are carried out. She said those impacts were reasonable but must be closely monitored. “During a state of emergency, some limitations on human rights may be unavoidable – and these are not decisions we can take lightly. Any restriction on human rights must be necessary, justifiable, proportionate and time-bound,” Hilton said. She added: “The government should establish an independent committee to scrutinise the response, that is informed by human rights expertise and can hear directly from the public. This is critical in maintaining public confidence and transparency.” The Victorian opposition called for the establishment of such a committee, but the deputy Nationals leader, Steph Ryan, said the government refused to establish a committee with a non-government majority. Hilton said the Victorian Government had filed a statement of compatibility, to show that the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities had been carefully considered in the drafting of the laws, but that did not do away with the need for continual monitoring and independent oversight. Perth airport says it has blocked four Virgin planes from being moved because the airline owes it $16m in airfield and terminal use fees. An airport spokeswoman said Qantas has also “unilaterally” refused to pay $20m in fees, although there’s no sign of any bulldozers in front of jets sporting the flying kangaroo yet. The spokeswoman said: “Virgin has significant outstanding invoices from Perth airport for airfield and terminal use charges – money the airline has already collected from its passengers and the FIFO sector. “While Perth airport is working with the Virgin administrators, it also needs to protect its own interests. “Perth airport has taken liens over a number of Virgin aircraft – a standard practice in these situations.” The terminal Virgin usually uses,T1, is closed and the planes in question aren’t currently in use due to the coronavirus crisis. But Virgin continues to operate charter flights from T2 for the Fifo – fly-in-fly-out – workers in Western Australia’s mining industry. Labor leader Anthony Albanese says privacy concerns about the contact tracing app need to be addressed. He says the parliament will also scrutinise the legislation supporting the app. “We will be scrutinising the legislation carefully that the government has said they will provide it to us in advance and we will be ensuring that privacy concerns are met. It can be, obviously, a very useful tool. The medical experts have said that.” He says the parliamentary committees should have access to the legislation before it hits parliament to speed up the process of passing it in the second week of May. Gilbert ends the interview by saying Australia’s in a very good position in dealing with coronavirus. “Better than most, let’s keep it that way,” Morrison replies. Morrison won’t be drawn on whether the government will consider broadening or raising the GST as part of the rebound effort post coronavirus pandemic. He says everything should be on the table, but the goal should be jobs, investment and growth. “You don’t have to put people’s taxes up,” he says. On the contact tracing app, Morrison says people should not be worried about it. “This has one job and that is to help that health officer sitting in that office in Sydney or Melbourne...” He compares it to the manual contact tracing method (which relies on human memory, not a recorded list of everyone you’ve been around). “We’ve put the protections in place. You download the app, you’re making yourself safer, you’re making your family safer, and you’re making the community safer.” He says it is up to Australians to get to that 40% uptake, and he says he will be downloading the app himself. The app will be out “very soon”, he says. “It is hurting, it is hurting hard,” Morrison says, about the economic impact. Yes there are another three weeks before restrictions will be potentially eased, but states are moving already. He says if they can do it even a day earlier they will, but he doesn’t want to open everything up and then have to close it down again, which would cost more. Good afternoon, everyone. Prime minister Scott Morrison is being interviewed by Sky News’ Kieran Gilbert. Morrison says Australia is in a much better position now than the national cabinet thought we would be when it was first convened. He says it is “possible” to eliminate coronavirus entirely, but an eradication strategy is “everyone getting under the doona and not getting out” and you can’t run a country like that. On that note, I will hand you over to Josh Taylor for the next little bit. Thank you again for joining us this week. It means a lot. Stay well this weekend – and take care of you. Aged care minister Richard Colbeck has put out a statement on the aged care edicts Scott Morrison was talking about: Aged care minister Richard Colbeck says while providers shared a responsibility to protect the wellbeing of senior Australians in care, total lockdowns of facilities were not supported by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) or the national cabinet. It follows calls by Prime Minister Scott Morrison who reminded providers not to impose tougher visitor restrictions. Age care providers that wish to have an exemption from the national arrangements should seek authority through the commonwealth. ... But Minister Colbeck said the call to work to the AHPPC recommendations was not a green light to go back to pre-Covid visitation routines. It is also recommended that all aged care workers and visitors have their flu vaccinations by 1 May. Anthony Albanese will hold his press conference at 3.20pm You may have seen the prime minister and the chief medical officer talk about masks as part of that press conference about an hour or so ago. Labor’s Andrew Leigh says they need to be made available to charities, writing to Greg Hunt to ask the government to provide them: I note recent reports that the government has been able to replenish stockpiles of personal protective equipment. Australian charities are working hard to maintain vital services to vulnerable Australians – providing, for example, acute mental health support, emergency relief and disability support – and in many cases are facing increased costs to provide staff and volunteers with appropriate protective equipment. Services provided by frontline charities will have increasing importance to the community as physical distancing measures continue. Yet at a time when demand on many services is increasing, donations and program-based revenue is falling. On top of this financial strain, the need to provide adequate safety equipment has left many charities with a choice of either spending scarce resources to purchase personal protective equipment at a commercial rate in a sellers’ market, or discontinuing services in spite of increased demand. While our healthcare workers rightly have the highest priority claim on the commonwealth’s reserves of personal protective equipment, I urge you to work with representatives in the charity and community sector to create pathways for not-for-profit providers of vital support services to get access to stockpiled equipment. These organisations are playing an important role in keeping vulnerable Australians healthy and socially connected. Supporting expert service providers to stay active in our communities will be beneficial for all. And it is not just charities. Aged care “in house” workers – who may not be nurses, but take care of the showering and feeding needs, or in some cases go into people’s homes for community care, are also crying out for masks. One of the issues with aged care is the tight margins facilities operate with, so that is not only impacting staffing levels, but also, the equipment being provided. It’s not just Coogee – Maroubra and Clovelly have been closed again, as well. The restrictions have impacted a lot of people’s lives in ways you wouldn’t think of, until you are experiencing it yourself. Here is another way I know a lot of families are dealing with right now The ACCC says 7-Eleven stores do not have to be trading 7-Eleven (or any other hours) if they don’t want to: 7-Eleven and its franchisees have been granted conditional interim authorisation to discuss potential temporary store closures or reduced trading hours in light of reduced customer demand because of Covid-19 restrictions. 7-Eleven owns and operates stores in competition with its franchisees in some areas and therefore discussions and agreements between them risk breaching the competition laws. “We recognise that 7-Eleven and its franchisees are facing difficult trading conditions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and believe this cooperation could help the network and individual stores to remain viable,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. “Importantly, franchisees are not required to temporarily close or reduce their store hours if they do not wish to. Our decision to grant interim authorisation does not force franchisees to agree to the terms offered by 7-Eleven.” Franchisees that agree to close temporarily will receive an ex-gratia payment from 7-Eleven to cover certain unavoidable operational costs. For franchisees that agree to reduce their hours, the minimum guaranteed income that the franchisee receives from 7-Eleven would be pro-rata adjusted to reflect the temporary reduction in trading hours. The Law Council still has some reservations about the tracing app, and has suggested the government adhere to some principles to make everyone feel a little better about it: With the government’s Covid-19 tracing app in development, the Law Council of Australia is calling for the adoption of core design principles to be included within the legislative framework, designed to govern the operation of the app. Placing the app on legislative foundations will ensure that the parameters for the app’s use are clear, certain, legally effective and not susceptible to removal or amendment by unilateral executive action. ... The series of core principles include clear governing laws and administrative frameworks, adoption of a voluntary ‘opt-in’ model, limitations on the collection of users’ personal information, a prohibition on any secondary use or disclosure of information collected by the app, security of personal information, and limited use of de-identified information for specified public health purposes amongst others. See the Core Principles document. If you need even more Scott Morrison on your Friday, he will be on Sky News at 3pm. Here is what Coogee beach looked like this morning, before it was closed again. Prof Brendan Murphy barely contained his laughter when asked about this. And then remembered he was on national television The prime minister finishes his press conference by effectively saying he expects everyone to be out on their driveways at dawn, for the Anzac dawn service. Other than that, I will see everyone tomorrow morning at 5.30. I will be at the national War Memorial. Everyone else will be at home. At 6.00 I look forward to the entire nation, on their driveways, lighting up the dawn, remembering our heroes and drawing inspiration from them for the task and challenge we currently face. Thank you very much. Scott Morrison finishes his press conference with a reminder that parliament is returning on 12, 14 and 13 May. I met with the opposition last night, our regular weekly get-together. On the Wednesday of that week, there will also be the Federation Chamber operating in the House of Representatives. The arrangements that we’ve had in place for the other days of sittings will be pursued when we return in more or less the same form, ensuring the chamber operates with the appropriate social distancing. But I anticipate we’ll see a lot more members back in the Parliament House, but obviously they can’t all be in the chamber at the one time. Or, indeed, in the Federation Chamber at the one time. The business of the parliament in that week, it will be the ordinary business of the parliament. The ACT has recorded one new case of Covid-19 in the past 14 hours. Authorities are working out how he contracted the virus. And then the nation gets another dose of guilt about civic duty when it comes to the tracing app, as Scott Morrison talks about how the national cabinet is looking at lifting the restrictions: What we also want to be careful of, and this is why we’re doing it in a very sort of incremental, iterative way as a national cabinet, is what we don’t want to see is a stop-start approach to our road back. This is why getting in place the sentinel testing, the testing regime, the contact tracing, which is very much helped by this app, this health app, a public health app that helps health workers help you, we need this so we can have the protections in place for you, your family, so you can get back to work, so you can get your kids back to school, so you can get back into community sport – that is what this app helps you do. That’s what it’s designed to do. That’s why we’ve been so direct about it and so careful about its construction and the protections that are there. And to have this, as you say in your question, this rapid response that can deal with the condition on the ground, of course there will be outbreaks. I think we can anticipate that. But where you have the response capability and the AUSMAT teams and other quite well-trained and highly qualified people to go and seal off those outbreaks, then you can keep the rest of the country moving at the same time. That is our much preferred position. You know, you don’t want to go on a stop-start basis, and that’s why you’ve gotta be careful when you come to relax some of these restrictions. On why he wants people back in workplaces, Scott Morrison says: I would love to see a return to normal right across the board. Of course we want to see that. And that includes people going to work in offices. And that’s an important part of how our economy functions. I mean, there are some people who can work from home, and for whom this period of time has been less of an inconvenience to them than it has to many others. But I can – I’m sure you’d know that if you’re a parent at home, trying to work from home and you’ve also got the kids at home, and they’re trying to learn, it’s not working too well for you. And your productivity isn’t doing too well either. And so when we can get back to the point where we can have kids back at school, and we can get people back at work, then I think we’re gonna see that also lift our economy in ways that we very much need. Because we want our economy to support businesses and jobs, not government through subsidies and income support payments and things of that nature. I mean, our social security net will always be there for those who need it. But our preference and priority is always to ensure that our economy is what supports people’s livelihoods. And that’s what we need again. Prof Brendan Murphy is barely holding back incredulous laughter when asked if anyone should follow Donald Trump’s latest brain fart about dealing with the coronavirus – which was basically injecting disinfectant (kill it with bleach! and yourself!) and blasting yourself with massive amounts of UV light (kill it by giving yourself cancer!). Murphy: Um ... I would not ... I would caution against the injection of disinfection! They could be quite toxic to people. I wasn’t privy to his comments, so I want to be very careful about commenting on something that I didn’t hear myself. And ultraviolet light, look, I don’t know the context in which he said it, so I really would need to study it before I could comment, thank you. My dad used to clean my cuts with Pine-o-cleen because it saved money and he figured one disinfectant was as good as another, but even he would draw the line at injecting it. On the issues with the implementation of the jobkeeper wage subsidy, Scott Morrison says it is something which is being addressed: We’re working closely, as the treasurer is, in particular, as is the tax commissioner, on the implementation issues around jobkeeper. And let’s also remember that where jobkeeper doesn’t apply, jobseeker does kick in. So, these two work together, and that’s always been important. Jobkeeper was never intended to be a catch-all for every Australian worker, or a worker who had their hours significantly reduced or, indeed, was stood down. It was intended to be there as an important element of the income support that we put in place, and the lifeline to businesses and to keep people connected to businesses. But where that can’t be in place because of arrangements that we’ve set to ensure that we manage these issues well, not just administratively but fiscally, then jobseeker is available. As I said, we’re approaching now almost 600,000 claims for jobseeker over these last five or so weeks, which has been quite an effort on their part. And, again, I thank those who have made claims, and those who are still awaiting for their claims to be processed for their patience. Queensland has announced it will look at whether the school restrictions need to be extended beyond the fifth week of term two, which is around mid-May. But anyone who wants to send their child to school, can. They are open. Parents have been advised to talk to principals if they have any concerns. I know, because my sister is a public school teacher in Queensland. And also, because I pay attention to press conferences. In response to this tweet Scott Morrison says the home affairs minister is just “expressing his opinion as a local”. Well, look, I’d simply say that Peter, of course, is a minister in my government, but he’s also a Queenslander. And these are issues that are being debated and addressed in Queensland. And whether you’re a local member, a minister or just any old Queenslander, then you do get to have the right to have a view as a local. And I’m sure that’s the context in which Peter’s expressed those views. How does the chief medical officer see restrictions being lifted for gatherings, as well as travel? I mean, there may be a situation where a country has effectively eliminated or got very low cases. For example, New Zealand, we might have a situation where it could be relaxed. But if you’re coming from a country where there is significant community transmission, I think that the impact - you’ve seen the graphs. The impact of our quarantine measures on what’s happened in Australia has been huge. Clearly the national cabinet has asked us to come back with a range of potential recommendations for gently, carefully, cautiously relaxing distancing measures. And, of course, the size of gatherings will be in that mix. But I don’t want to pre-empt the decisions of national cabinet. But we will be making recommendations. Similar to those that you’re talking about. And they’ll be coming to national cabinet. It will be their decision. Scott Morrison moves to address some more concerns about the tracing app – namely where the server will be situated: The server is in Australia and it’s using AWS, who work with Australia on many, many sensitive issues. In terms of Australia’s data management. It’s a nationally encrypted data store. It is illegal - it will be illegal for information to go out of that data store to any other person other than that for whom the whole thing is designed, and that is to support the health worker in the state to be able to undertake the contact tracing, with the data that they access being released by the individual for whom is the subject of the contact tracing. Although people would probably be feeling much more comfortable with the idea of the app if the government hadn’t passed “national security” legislation which allows the government to force tech companies to build secret backdoors into apps, which can be accessed, without anyone knowing. I am not saying that is happening here, but I am saying trust is low for a reason. A lot of jurisdictions have already done this – but testing will be extended across the nation, to ensure any community transmission is being picked up, Professor Brendan Murphy says: In particular, national cabinet was informed today that every single jurisdiction has now – every state and territory has now broadened their testing criteria from today. Some did it earlier. So that anybody with acute respiratory symptoms – cough, sore throat, runny nose, cold symptoms, flu-like symptoms – can get tested. This will significantly expand the population of people tested. We’re pretty confident that most of them will be negative, but this will give us a really broad reach of what we call passive surveillance. But we’re also looking at a range of active surveillance mechanisms to test even people without symptoms in a range of frontline occupations and a range of what we call sentinel situations, where we sample the population. National cabinet is very clear that they want to be absolutely confident before relaxing any measures that we are in a position in this country to detect any community transmission of any significance. Scott Morrison then moves to how Australia has moved into the “community phase” of monitoring the spread of Covid-19, where it has to watch for community transmission: We now have to be wary against community transmission, and so we are dealing with that third wave of the virus. We will also be then working towards decisions that we have to make over the next few weeks, getting the key data metrics in place as to how we’ll make decisions on further easing of restrictions. We are, though, I confirm, seeing states and territories individually waiving various parts of the restrictions they have put in place above the baselines. They’re making those announcements almost on a daily basis. We welcome that, whether it’s in schools or in other areas, and we can expect to see that happen over the next few weeks. The national cabinet will meet next Friday again. Sorry for the slight delay - my computer had a slight meltdown. Back to the press conference, Scott Morrison says it is time for aged care facilities to start allowing visits, if they are not already, or face having to get commonwealth permission for changing the arrangements: On aged care, there is a meeting this evening, a webinar, and national cabinet has continued to stress its concern about restrictions that are being put in place in aged care facilities, as I noted earlier this week, beyond the baseline requirements of what national cabinet has agreed, based on the expert medical advice. So, we are flagging – I am flagging very clearly at a federal level – that should we not see an improvement in this area, under the voluntary arrangements that we currently have in place, that the commonwealth would be moving to require aged care facilities that wish to have an exemption to those national principles, those national arrangements, then they would need to seek authority to do that from the commonwealth, and we would make such a decision in consultation with the relevant state and territory jurisdiction. Now, there are quite valid reasons why you would have exemptions, particularly as we’ve seen in north-west Tasmania at the moment, or what we’ve seen in western Sydney or in other places. That is entirely sensible as to why you would have restrictions that are greater than the national baseline in those circumstances. Totally reasonable. But more broadly, having people stuck in their rooms, not being able to be visited by their loved ones and carers and other support people, that’s not OK. And so let’s see how the industry goes with that. We would very much like to keep these things on a basis where aged care facilities are exercising their proper discretion. But we are not going to have these as secret places, where people can’t access them. We will see some new modelling during this Meanwhile, as Scott Morrison talks of opening public spaces up once again, Coogee beach is once again closed: On the theme of ‘national principles’, there are also safe workplace national principles on the way. Scott Morrison: This is all about getting Australians back to work, and ensuring that when they go back to work that they and their families can feel safe in going back to work, and to ensure that there are important principles in place, there are protocols and procedures that, should a Covid case present in a workplace, then the rules that people need to follow... The minister for industrial relations has been working closely with the Covid commission, union representatives and others to ensure we get helpful tools in place. On exercise and training, Scott Morrison says “national principles” will be released: The first, at the elite and professional level. So, the major sporting codes, our Olympic sports, training arrangements that sit around support for those activities, by elite sportspeople. Secondly, at the community competitive sport level. That is such an important part of our way of life here in Australia, and the principles that can help guide decisions by states and territories in the future. And, thirdly, at the individual passive level of sport and recreation. Activities from everything from - whether it’s in the shire, if you’re going surfing, or if you’re walking in the local national park, or whatever it might happen to be, those set of principles that states and territories can draw on in terms of getting some consistency across the country as we move into this next phase. Scott Morrison on schools: On schools, confirmation – and this is in the medical expert advice – the AHPPC’s document being released today – confirmation that the 4 sq metre rule, and the 1.5m distancing between students during classroom activities is not appropriate and not required. I can’t be more clear than that. The advice cannot be more clear than that. The 1.5m in classrooms and the 4 sq metre rule is not a requirement of the expert medical advice in classrooms. Scott Morrison on wearing of masks: On a couple of quite specific issues, on the wearing of masks, and Brendan Murphy, the professor, will talk a little bit more about this. But on the wearing of masks, the medical expert panel, we accepted their advice that it is not recommended by the expert panel that they are necessary to be worn, and importantly, it’s important to note that the wearing of such a mask does not protect you from an infection, but if you are displaying respiratory symptoms then it is, at best, a measure that prevents you transferring it to others. It’s not about protecting you from infection, but that’s why, when people were leaving airports and things of that nature, they were wearing it to prevent the transmission. The tracing app is on its way. Scott Morrison: There are still some issues we’re working through late in the piece, which is to be expected. We’re not too far away now. Earlier this week, as I indicated to you, it received the in-principle support of the national cabinet and we have been taking that through its final stages in recent days. That will be also an important tool for the country as we seek to manage how we live in a Covid-safe economy and community into the future. And the rapid response to individual outbreaks – we should be aware, as a community right across the country, that when we take further steps to ease restrictions, of course, we will continue to see outbreaks. That is to be expected. What matters is being able to move on them quickly. The prime minister starts the press conference by passing on the national cabinet’s and the nation’s, condolences to the families of the four Victorian police officers who were killed on Wednesday night, during a traffic stop. The Nine Network’s Charles Croucher had this lovely story last night. I don’t think anyone would be surprised to see the industries which have been hardest hit so far The national cabinet meeting has ended. Scott Morrison will give an update at 1pm. Western Australia authorities have reported a passenger on the Artania cruise ship, who was being treated for Covid-19, died overnight. The man, aged in his 70s, is the eighth person to die in WA and the 78th person to die in Australia, after a Covid-19 diagnosis. We heard yesterday that so far, almost $4bn has been withdrawn from super funds, from people struggling under financial pressure because of the Covid-19 crisis. There will be another round opened up in the next financial year. The average withdrawal has been $8,000. But how much will that cost when you want to retire? The select Senate committee looking at the Covid-19 response will hold another hearing next week. Treasury will be up then. In the meantime, the transcript from yesterday, which featured Prof Brendan Murphy and officials from the health department, is up. Food security in remote Indigenous communities is a problem at the best of times, but it has been exacerbated by the coronavirus, to the point where people have been unable to source essentials for weeks in some communities. A group of 13 Aboriginal organisations from across the Northern Territory this week called on the national cabinet to do more to guarantee food security for remote communities. Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, convened a second round table of the major supermarkets, the NT government and the community stores, to guarantee supply. Coles announced today it has donated more than 80 pallets, or about 50 tonnes of food and grocery essentials, to remote communities across the Northern Territory this week. The packages include fresh and tinned produce, pasta, rice, biscuits and breakfast cereals. “Spring water, toilet paper, nappies and sanitary items will also be delivered to residents in Darwin, Alice Springs and to many remote communities such as Santa Teresa, Beswick and Elliott, which is 735 km away from a Coles store,” a spokesman said in a statement about the delivery. Sarah Hanson-Young has a bit to say in a statement about the removal of environmental “red tape” during this pandemic: The Morrison government has declared war with the environment with its announcement it plans to cut ‘green tape’ even before the 10-year review of environmental laws is completed, the Greens say. Greens spokesperson for the environment Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: ‘Using the cover of Covid-19 as an excuse to scrap environmental protections is an act of bastardry, and everyday Australians will be appalled. ‘This anti-environment government has always had cuts to environmental protections in favour of its big business mates on its agenda. ‘They seem to think Australians are distracted enough by the Covid-19 pandemic they won’t notice this latest attack. But I’ve got news for the environment minister, Australians care about the environment now more than ever and won’t take this lying down. ‘Trying to cut environmental protections to give big business, who donate to major political parties, easy access to cut down, dig up and trample the environment in the name of economic stimulus after a global pandemic is shameful. ‘We need stronger environmental laws, not weaker ones. The EPBC Act is already failing in its purpose of protection conservation and biodiversity with flora and fauna continuing to become threatened species and even going extinct. ‘Fast-tracking applications will do even more damage. As it is, only about 2 per cent of applications under the EPBC Act get knocked back. Federal court judge John Middleton has decided to allow administrators of Virgin Australia to avoid personal liability for the stricken airline’s $1.2bn in aircraft leases for a month. Middleton has also allowed the administrators, Vaughan Strawbridge, Salvatore Algeri, John Greig and Richard Hughes, of accounting firm Deloitte, to hold a meeting of creditors next Thursday by videolink and correspond with creditors by email. At a hearing this morning - itself held by videoline - Middleton said that any interested party that objected to the orders could come to the court and he would hear them on short notice. Middleton said he could himself turn out to be a creditor of Virgin Australia because he has booked flights to be taken in July. He said he also held points in Virgin’s frequent flyer scheme, Velocity, which is not in administration, and was a member of the airline’s lounge club. Got a sniffle and live in NSW? The government would love it if you got tested for Covid. From the NSW health release: The NSW government is urging anyone experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 to be tested in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. Covid-19 symptoms include: · Fever; · Cough; · Tiredness (fatigue); · Sore throat; · Shortness of breath. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian today announced there is now capacity to double the number of Covid-19 tests from around 4,000 tests per day to 8,000. And within that report The Parliamentary Budget Office has a new report out - this one on unlegislated measures carried forward into budget estimates. It is before any of the Covid measures were in place though, so don’t expect to find that. With all the talk about new ideas for the Australian economy, Anthony Albanese was also pressed on what he thought needed to happen, while on Melbourne radio 3AW this morning. Here is what he came up with: Hydrogen is an industry that can absolutely power steel and can power aluminium. How about we look at, for example, in Gladstone, they’re looking at, Rio Tinto own the aluminium refinery there, what they want to do is to power that up with solar energy in order to operate. They reckon they can double their capacity. ... One of the things that we could look at, for example, is go back to the Henry Tax Review. And one of the things that it said was that when you look at tax, you change behaviour. What sort of behaviour do we want? ... For example, rather than looking at just company tax cuts, I think what makes far more sense is to look at how do we encourage investment in Australia that creates jobs by companies. Neil Mitchell didn’t waste any time with his opening question to Anthony Albanese this morning: Mitchell: Is Scott Morrison doing a good job? Albanese: Look, I think the Australian people are doing a good job. And when the prime minister has got together with the state premiers and territory leaders, it is a good thing that we are getting more cooperation than we have historically in our federation system. I think … listening to the medical experts has been good. And that engagement has been constructive. I think that it is a good thing, for example, and I met with the prime minister and other senior ministers last night. So we are spending just over $90m on emergency fuel stock and $2.5m on storage for the fuel, to keep it in America, because we have nowhere to store it onshore. Which completely goes against the point of having an emergency fuel store. The point of the store being that if there is a conflict, or supply chains are cut, you have fuel on hand. Which Australia does not. Because it will be in America. baby steps. Mathias Cormann has released the latest spendings: This week I made $94 million in additional funding available to support the government’s purchase of oil stocks and the leasing of storage capacity in the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve by using the Advance to the Finance Minister. One determination of $91.5 million for purchasing oil was made from the Advance which was appropriated by the parliament in the Appropriation Act (No. 6) 2019-2020; and A second determination of $2.5 million for leasing storage was made from the Advance which was appropriated by the parliament in the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 2019-2020. Both determinations were signed yesterday. The determinations were registered on the Federal Register of Legislation, together with an Explanatory Statement (these will be available on legislation.gov.au). Given the writings of former prime ministers are in vogue, here’s the latest from the 28th: This seems pretty to the point: Police in Victoria appear to be continuing the trend of slapping anyone who is out allegedly conducting another crime with a fine for breaching social distancing laws. This seems to be a liberal interpretation of the public health orders unless you want to argue that robbers, like other professionals, should be working from home during this period. In the past 24 hours police have issued 54 on-the-spot fines. Recipients included three men fined for attending a birthday party in Romsey, four men and one woman who were spotted together at Winchelsea football oval, and “multiple people committing criminal offences, including robberies, vehicle theft and drug related offences”. This is interesting, given that Australia is taking some of the TraceTogether code base for its own app (some, not all): Six more Victorians have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. As we heard about a week ago, a mental health worker had been diagnosed with the virus, which authorities were keeping an eye on, given their contacts. The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, confirmed a mental health facility (unnamed) had seen a cluster of cases, with 14 people linked to the facility now diagnosed with Covid-19. “Five are patients, five are staff and four are household close contacts,” she said. “Further testing will be undertaken today to determine if there is any further spread.” During the Sars epidemic, civet cats were thought to be one of the vectors which led to that virus being transmitted to humans. The evidence is very scant when it comes to Covid-19, but the World Health Organisation has previously said that cats don’t seem to be playing a major role in transmission to humans, but can catch the virus from people. Dogs, so far, seem to be OK. It is the first time in about three weeks that Tasmania has recorded no new cases. But given the devastation the virus can cause in that community particularly, Peter Gutwein has decided to extend the strict lockdown restrictions, which have been in place in the north-west, for another week. They had been due to be lifted this weekend. Gutwein says there needs to be more testing done, before they can risk it. That’s why today, following advice from Public Health, we have taken the extremely difficult decision to extend the additional restrictions, the additional retail restrictions that are in place on the north-west coast, out for another week until next Sunday, 3 May. It’s not a decision that is taken lightly. I know many in the north-west will be unhappy about this. But we need to get on top of this. We need to stamp this out. We need to crush this virus. We need to understand right across the community if this virus is there, and importantly to track and trace it aggressively. While there is certainly promising signs that the north-west is coming under control, an additional week of deeper testing will ensure that we have a very clear understanding of what’s occurring right across the coast and it will be our best opportunity to ensure that we have this outbreak completely under control and, importantly, if there are pockets to stamp them out as quickly as we possibly can. I would ask that the people of the north-west bear with us. But Peter Gutwein said there had been no new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in Tasmania in the last 24 hours. He said that news, combined with the death of another Tasmanian, was conflicting: To the woman’s family, friends and loved ones – I’m sorry. On behalf of the government, I extend our condolences and sympathies to you all. To lose someone else is just an absolute tragedy. It brings the total to nine lives lost in the state to the virus in past months. As I’ve continually said, there will be bad days. But there will also be better days as well. Today, unfortunately, is another one of those bittersweet moments. To stand here and have to announce that we’ve lost another life is something that gives me deep concern and is, you know, again, something that I must admit troubles me deeply. I find it very difficult to do. However, what it does do, it sharpens my resolve to get on top of this and stamp out this insidious virus. Tasmania has recorded another death, after a 79-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, passed away overnight. She is the ninth person to have died in Tasmania after contracting Covid-19. Anzac Day is going to look very different tomorrow, from what we have become used to since the Howard years. There will be no flag waving crowds, or thumping displays of nationalism. There will be commemorations and quiet reflections. And, of course, biscuits. The only answer here is chewy. Obviously. Unless you like bad biscuits. In which case, I cannot help you. Of all the sport hub ideas for a post-restrictions Australia, this really seems like a no-brainer: (via AAP) Fremantle coach Justin Longmuir has backed a Victorian push to host a quarantine hub in a bid to restart the AFL season. All states and territories are being considered by the AFL to set-up a hub to ensure the competition resumes amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The AFL is weighing up whether to put together one hub for all 18 clubs, or spreading teams across Australia in multiple locations. Most states, including Western Australia through premier Mark McGowan, have already declared their interest in setting up a hub. But first-year Dockers mentor Longmuir believes Victoria would have an advantage over his home state with 14 days of quarantine required for anyone entering Western Australia. Travel restrictions between states are not in place for Victoria and NSW. In the meantime, I will continue to wish for NRL island to be a thing. Maybe forever. All signs point to schools resuming on-site learning by mid-May: Back on the carbon price, because it is something you are going to hear a lot about in coming months. Don’t expect the final term to include the words “carbon price”. Anthony Albanese, in his interview with the ABC, said the market had moved beyond what the Gillard-Rudd government had promoted: What I’m saying is that you did need a price signal a decade ago. There has been a change now so that renewables are not just competitive, they are, in fact, the cheapest form of new energy production. And in terms of what you have seen is a bizarre circumstance where by the government have been talking about subsidising a new coal-fired power station in north Queensland and indeed have made a substantial contribution for a company to study themselves whether their project is viable or not. That shows the way that the market itself has changed. The government hasn’t changed its rhetoric, and they need to do so. They need to listen to the science and acknowledge that we do need to act on climate change. We need to drive down our emissions and there are, indeed, advantages for employment in doing that. It is good environmental policy, but it is also good economic policy. While we are talking about the future, Mathias Cormann spoke to Laura Jayes this morning on Sky and repeated what Scott Morrison has been saying – higher taxes are not on the Coalition’s agenda. So everything is on the table, except that. But in the way things go in Australian politics, we are, of course, talking about ideas which had been dismissed, by one side of politics or the other, for no other reason than a different side of politics once suggested it or tried to enact it. One being, a carbon price. Which Labor is in support of. As are the unions. As are the main business lobby groups. But which the Coalition was very much not in support of. But that could be changing, because it is popping up quite a bit lately, and that is actually a good thing, because maybe, just maybe, there could be a grown up discussion on the issue. Anthony Albanese was also asked about that this morning: One of the things that has happened over recent times of course is that the cost of energy, the cheapest form, is new renewables. What it needs is a government that is prepared to provide certainty in terms of the energy market and providing a policy framework that will drive that investment. We’ve seen investment in 2019 fall off the cliff for renewables but we also need to look at the way that renewables and clean energy can drive advance manufacturing, can add to our industrial growth with new industries and new energy sources such as hydrogen as well can play an important role. There has been a lot of talk lately about whether or not the new bipartisanship and openness to ideas we have been seeing over the last six weeks will extend to a post-Covid Australia, at least politically. Part of it will have to – the economy is not going to look anything like it has, and pulling Australia through the next years is not going to be easy. Or pretty. But this is Australian politics, so I don’t think anyone is overly hopeful. Anthony Albanese gave his opinions on that this morning, when speaking to the ABC: I would hope that some of the government’s rhetorical changes last beyond the current crisis. They’ve acknowledged that unions play a constructive role in society rather than their previous concentration on attacking the rights of working people and the trade union movement. They have acknowledged that we need to listen to the science and I hope that that translates into other issues beyond medical science, into environmental science, into listening to what the scientists are telling us about the need to act on climate change, and they have acknowledged there is a role for government in providing support for the private sector to operate. We certainly will need a strengthening of the private sector coming out of this crisis but we will also need to acknowledge the vital role the government plays, the contracting out, for example, of Centrelink services meant that we weren’t in a position to actually look after people when it was needed during this crisis. Peter Dutton spoke to the Nine network this morning and said banks that did not pass on bridging finance to businesses which were struggling to pay their staff should be “publicly shamed”. Australia’s banks have access to some pretty cheap credit at the moment, the idea being that they use those credit lines, which are basically secured by the government, to provide credit lifelines to businesses. Businesses need those credit lines because there was a time gap between when the government’s wage subsidy was announced and when the ATO started paying it out. If you have no one coming in and spending money in your business, you have no way to pay your staff. And round and round it goes. But the banks, which got in massive amounts of trouble in Australia for lending to just about anybody with a pulse and identification not that long ago, are now getting in trouble for not rushing those loans out. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg held a phone hook-up with the banks yesterday. The morning TV and radio shows will tell you it was a FURIOUS phone call, which means the political spinners can give themselves a pat on the back this morning. Morrison and Frydenberg both spoke about the call yesterday and gave a public warning to the banks to start the credit flowing. This morning it was Dutton’s turn: The banks have got a lot of stepping up to do. There’s been a lot of activity already, where you can point to case where is they have provided significant assistance, but it needs to be more widespread. We want people to remain connected with their businesses. We hope that, over the next few weeks, we can start to see the economy take its first steps back to normality, and that will require the banks to be involved, for credit to be extended, wages need to be paid, and businesses need to be paid, and businesses need to be able to put themselves in a position where they can reopen and re-function. It’s just gone NSW press conference o’clock. Gladys Berejiklian says there were seven new cases in the last 24 hours, but added that the state had increased the amount of testing it was doing. Can I again thank all of you and say the New South Wales government is considering what we can do moving forward to ease everybody’s stress that you are going through and part of that strategy is increasing the number of testing, making that more available to everybody across the state but also making all of us aware that if we do consider going forward in the future with lifting restrictions we also have to be prepared to practice social isolation because we know that cases will go up and people will need hospitals. That is why we have bought ourselves good time in New South Wales and in preparing our health system and other institutions for what the next few months might look like. The Victorian parliament sat to pass its coronavirus legislation yesterday. Its emergency bills passed last night. As AAP reports: The government now plans to borrow $24.5 billion to help the state combat the economic carnage from the virus. The mammoth COVID-19 omnibus also includes temporary changes, including the introduction of judge-alone criminal trials, virtual meetings for state and council politicians, WorkCover extensions and a ban on evictions and rent increases, with a sunset clause of six months. As well, the Victorian government has set up a dedicated taskforce to help keep the state’s building and development industry running through the crisis. It has approved four new projects worth more than $1.5 billion. The state government’s omnibus bill passed with the support of the coalition, despite Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien’s concerns it grants unprecedented powers to the justice system. Karen Andrews was given the job of filling Australia’s manufacturing gaps (there are a lot of them, so it is mostly the most crucial, such as medical PPE which has been the focus) as the government turns towards what broken supply chains would mean for an island nation. There is still no talk of subsidies to reanimate the manufacturing sector in Australia. Instead, there is a lot of talk of “identifying the gaps”. As you would know, there is no hope of a long-term manufacturing resurgence, without government assistance. That is an issue for another day – at the moment, Andrews is happy when an Australian company can switch its focus for something the nation needs. The latest? Clets Linen &amp; Co Pty Ltd, which normally specialises in linen and garments for hospitality and other industries, will provide 3,750 disposable isolation gowns to the national medical stockpile in its first production run. Greg Hunt has committed an additional $6m to drug and alcohol addiction support during the pandemic. That includes: · $2m to the Alcohol and Drug Foundation to deliver an information and awareness campaign to make Australians aware of the support that is available, and to develop resources specific to the isolation context. · $1.5m to Turning Point to scale up treatment episodes provided by Counselling Online, and enable better integration of the service with primary care providers. · An additional $1.5m to Hello Sunday Morning’s Daybreak Program. Daybreak is a treatment and early invention mobile app that provides online support to individuals seeking assistance in reducing their alcohol consumption. The service helps Australians reduce risky drinking habits by simultaneously addressing the psychological and relationship issues that can sometimes drive drinking in the first place. · $0.4m to SMART Recovery to support adaptation of their service delivery model to an online format. · $0.6m to the Matilda Centre to support enhancements to Cracks in the Ice and Positive Choices portals, to target Australians impacted by isolation. Cracks in the ice provides information about crystal methamphetamine for community organisations. Positive Choices is an online portal to help school communities access accurate up-to-date drug education resources and prevention programs. In addition, the National Organisation for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Australia will deliver a Covid-19 Alcohol and Pregnancy campaign addressing increased alcohol consumption leading to unplanned alcohol-exposed pregnancies during the pandemic. The campaign will be implemented largely via social media and target women impacted by Covid-19 restrictions, particularly social isolation and quarantine. The national cabinet will meet today as part of its normal schedule. Australia has just finished the first week of the four-week suppression phase, which I guess would be better described as a holding pattern, so we don’t expect any big changes or announcements from this meeting. Queensland will move to have its changes to funeral restrictions – from 10 people to 20 – given the OK by the national cabinet. Scott Morrison will continue to push for schools to be reopen, although that doesn’t look like happening much beyond the fifth or sixth week of term, as the states give parents time to get used to the idea. Basically, everyone is in agreement that if the infection rates stay this low, restrictions can be lifted. But with nations like Singapore, which suppressed the virus only to see a surge when restrictions were lifted, as an example, the national cabinet is taking a softly, softly approach to how it will relax the physical distance rules. The woman speaking here, Sophie, would not be alone. And that is despite Australia’s rates being quite low. As AAP reports: A final-year medical student has been thrown out of her Brisbane share house because a housemate feared she would infect him with coronavirus. The student, identified only as Sophie, has told the ABC she was told to get out because she was on a placement at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s hospital. She said one of her housemates had become convinced that she would become infected with the virus and pass it on to him. The student said she picked up on her flatmate’s anxiety and all four housemates sat down to chat about minimising risks, how they’d support each other if any one of them got sick, and how they’d isolate in a shared environment. “I thought the conversation went reasonably well,” she said. “The next morning I received a message asking me to leave. He said he was sorry things had to be this way, but he was uncomfortable with the risk of me being a medical student and attending placement.” Sophie has since moved in with a friend but says her experience becoming suddenly homeless due to her job in health isn’t rare. “I have friends, personally, who’ve been asked to leave then their landlord has retracted that when it’s become apparent societally that it’s not acceptable,” she said. “Others have elected to move house to try and isolate themselves from their families if they’re working in a high-risk area, and really struggling to find somewhere to live.” She urged people to consider more than themselves during the coronavirus crisis. “I think we run into trouble when people only consider pandemics and coronavirus in terms of what’s the risk of you giving it to me.” The Ruby Princess has left Port Kembla and the nation is preparing for a very low-key Anzac Day. Other than that, it’s situation stay suppressed as Australia ends another week with a flatter curve. Anzac ceremonies will go virtual this year. Most RSLs have arranged for veterans to pay homage how they can and to ensure there is community support for those who want or need it. Ceremonies will be broadcast for those at home. Winston Peters, the deputy New Zealand prime minister, has been talking about reopening the trans-Tasman borders when possible as a sort of trans-Tasman “bubble” for some time. Yesterday Scott Morrison said it was New Zealand that Australia was looking to “reconnect” with as soon as possible. The leaders of both nations have been speaking every week, as usual, with both optimistic their countries can manage to suppress – or in NZ’s case, almost eliminate – Covid-19 from their populations ahead of a vaccine. Which means Australia is heading into the “sentinel” testing phase – testing people to ensure that the virus hasn’t spread to more of the community than anticipated. NSW is now opening testing to anyone with symptoms, not just those in the cluster areas. One in 70 people in Victoria are being tested as that state ramps up its procedures as well. We’ll cover all of the day as it happens. Thank you again for joining us. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day.

In Groningen, in the Netherlands, almost two-thirds of trips are made by bike, making it one of the most cycle-friendly cities in the world. It’s no accident that the Dutch city also has great air quality. The UK manages a meagre 2% cycling rate overall. And we all know about the air quality here. If, by the way, your wheels are redundant, please pass them on to the Bike Project to match with someone who desperately wants one. But actually you don’t need your own bike to clear the air. Public bike-share schemes – now fixtures across the world – are key to moving away from cars. But they’ve got to be good. The danger is that if there are no bikes in docking stations when you turn up and your commute is thwarted, you’ll revert to being a car driver – and an embittered one. Fears like this explain why three huge China- based firms ready to flood UK cities with bikes have been given a lukewarm reception. When China’s Ofo, the “Uber for bikes”, wheeled into Cambridge recently, it sparked fears that, in the absence of a carefully regulated docking station system, mountains of bikes would be abandoned in chaos. It’s early days, but we need more than bikes. Sorry to harp on about the Netherlands again, but with 22,000 miles of cycle paths, that’s what you call a cycling culture. It wasn’t always thus. In the late 1960s, Dutch towns were as car-centric as everyone else. The 1973 oil crisis, combined with fears about the danger to children from traffic, convinced a few planners to stand up to the car. Soon after, citizens woke up to find new one-way systems that meant there was no point trying to cross town in a car. That’s what you call tough love. The big picture: the future is green Is this the UK’s greenest building? Newly opened at Nottingham University, this science complex contains state of the art labs and reaches two prestigious sustainability standards, BREEAM Outstanding and LEED Platinum. There’s a carbon-neutral lab powered by solar energy and biofuel, and any excess heat is used by the rest of the campus. We hope emerging scientists are inspired by their surroundings. Well dressed: inside Gujerat’s textile powerhouse Gujarat, India’s most westerly state, is a textiles powerhouse. Giant textile factories in the single city of Surat produce 30m metres of man-made fibre every day (most tights will come from here). But the “power” is provided by workers (near to one million in this state alone) who toil in conditions described by filmmaker Rahul Jain as “extreme wretchedness”. Jain, whose maternal grandfather owned a textiles factory, was drawn to capture the dehumanising supply chain of the fashion industry. “The factory smelled like a vat of ammonia,” the director has said. Ammonia is used heavily in the manufacture of man-made fibres and in the processing of conventional cotton. In Machines, Jain’s wonderfully stylised and visually stunning film, you can almost smell it.

But these days that coal is shipped from a mine that is no longer digging. It is burned at a power plant that is about to be demolished. Port Augusta is the fabled canary in the coalmine – a coal town teetering on a precipice as it transitions away from fossil fuels. One possible future is the town creating hundreds of jobs by building Australia’s first major solar thermal power plant, sucking up the energy of the sun and providing a steady stream of power for southern Australia. On the other side of the precipice is decline, with the free market left to the decide the fate of the people who live in Port Augusta. Many factors seem to line up to favour the brighter path: local councillors, residents and anti-coal activists are campaigning for it; there is a state grant that seems almost designed for it; and possible federal interest from Malcolm Turnbull and his new clean energy fund. A US company with experience building solar thermal plants is enthusiastic about a thermal power plant, plus coal power workers and their union are on board with the idea. As the jostling, lobbying and campaigning carries on, towns around Australia and the world are looking on, hoping Port Augusta can do it. It would give hope to communities facing a similar future as the world starts to leave fossil fuels in the ground. But despite all the apparent support,both futures appear perfectly possible. And that’s terrifying for people in Port Augusta and others looking on. Coal jobs doomed “The closure of Alinta’s coal operations in the area are frankly devastating,” says Joseph Scales, secretary of the Australian Services Union, which represents most of the workers at the Northern power station, set to be shut down in May this year. When it closes, almost 200 people will lose their jobs. Some might be redeployed in the public sector – a deal that was made when the power plant was privatised – but the majority will find themselves with a redundancy package and slim job prospects in the area. Scales says the plant is the most significant employer in the region, helping to prop up the wider economy. When it goes, he says, if well-paid and secure jobs aren’t created in the region, it will have big ramifications for Port Augusta and the surrounding towns. It’s about more than just this region, Scales says. As coalmines and coal-fired power plants close around the country, he sees Port Augusta as a kind of test case for how Australia will handle the transition. Power stations and coalmines in Victoria’s Latrobe valley are set to shut down in coming years, and what will happens to the people working in those jobs is far from clear. “We ought to have been planning for what we call a ‘just transition’,” he says. Scales says the Australian Services Union acknowledges that the world needs to move away from coal and is calling for a plan that will allow those workers to be retrained and redeployed to assist with the transition. Reinventing fossil fuels jobs “I’ll be 55 this year,” says Gary Rowbottom, a technical officer at the Northern power station. “So I’ll need to really try and get another job for the next 10 years or so.” Rowbottom says while he hopes things work out well for the town, and it becomes a model for how towns can leave fossil fuels behind, in some ways it is already a lesson in what not to do. Things have been left too late, and already workers are looking for new jobs and leaving the area. “We’re a bad example because there’s a sudden cut off and then the possibility of solar thermal. We were hoping to have new things built before the closure so we could have an increase in jobs, not a big gap.” In 2012, Alinta’s other power station in the area – the Playford B power station – was shut. Then in November last year, the Alinta’s Leigh Creek coalmine, 250km to the north, which supplied the brown coal for the stations, ceased mining. (The coal was stockpiled and is now being shipped by train until it runs out.) And when the Northern power station shuts, that’s it for the coal industry in the region. But it doesn’t have to be it for the thermal power industry, insists a wide coalition of people. In fact, it seems impossible to find someone urging against the building of a solar thermal power plant. Since a solar thermal power station is still a thermal power station, it employs many of the same sorts of people. “Instead of having a coal feed and a boiler on the front end, we have a tall tower that we pump molten salt through and lots and lots of heliostats,” says Daniel Thompson, director of development in Australia at SolarReserve. “We’re kind of different at the front end but very similar on the back-end and the back-end is where the power is generated.” At the “back-end”, that heat is used to turn water into steam, which drives a steam turbine, just like a coal power plant. “So that’s why there is a very similar job arrangement to a conventional coal power station.” SolarReserve has built a 110MW solar thermal plant in the desert in Nevada, with more than 10,000 mirrors concentrating the sun’s heat on to a tower filled with molten salt. It’s building a similar plant now in South Africa and hopes to do something roughly the same in Port Augusta. “In Nevada, our Crescent Dunes project created roughly 4,000 jobs ,” he says. “We had more than 1,000 people on site at one time building it. And we’re creating between 45 and 50 full-time roles for operation and maintenance.” In the long term, that doesn’t fully replace the almost 200 people employed at the coal power plant that is closing, but Thompson says by being a first builder, Port Augusta could win itself the lion’s share of any future solar thermal industry that develops. He says there’s a possibility that the now-defunct car manufacturing industry in South Australia could be retrofitted to produce the mirrors and other components used in solar thermal plants. “One of the things we have lots of is the heliostats,” he says. Heliostats are the mirrors that focus all the sun at the central tower. “In the case of Crescent Dunes we have 10,347 of these. And each of them is 115 square meters. “So we are keen to explore whether it makes sense to locally manufacture them and we’ve been in discussion with some South Australian companies about that.” If the car factories could be retrofitted, that would undoubtedly be a major selling point for South Australia, which is reeling from auto industry closures. But Tom Georgis, senior vice-president of development at SolarReserve, says whether that happens will depend on how confident the market is that there will be more of solar thermal plants to justify investment in infrastructure. “There’s going to be a view taken by certain business sectors about the viability of the technology and the pipeline – how many of these types of projects are going to be built – and then business decisions will be made about whether or not investment will be made to retrofit an automotive fabrication facility to shift it over to producing components for the mirrors. We fully anticipate that is going to happen.” Georgis adds: “One of the key wildcards for us and the industry as a whole is the mining sector.” He thinks one of the biggest markets for the solar thermal plants is to power mines, which are often in remote locations and build their own off-grid power. He says the mining industry is naturally conservative and slow to adopt new technologies. But if it sees it working in Port Augusta, it might start to see it as a good option. “Port Augusta can be the catalyst for the creation of a fairly substantial industry in Australia. Both for grid-connected power supply into the [national electricity market] but also for the mining sector.” Salt, steam, power The type of power plant proposed by SolarReserve is based on its facility in Nevada, where mirrors focus the heat of the sun on to the tower containing molten salt. That salt can store the heat for days, if necessary, with minimal loss. When electricity is needed, the salt is circulated through a system where it produces steam, which drives a turbine. It provides what coal companies have established as the holy grail of power sources: base load power, which means that, like coal, it can provide energy constantly. But since it can be turned on and off when needed (unlike coal) it can also provide energy whenever it’s needed, like gas, in what is called “dispatchable power”. Manuel Blanco, director of the Australian Solar Thermal Research Initiative at the CSIRO, says that means the plants provide more than the mere total energy they create. By filling in the gaps left by solar and wind, they provide a kind of service to the grid. “They can act as base load. And you can also balance the amount of storage to suit the needs of what you want to do. “Sometimes critics of renewables energy say: ‘Well, wind is fine, but every time you put some capacity in the grid, you need a backup in case the wind is not blowing.’ But in these, they have the backup already there.” Blanco says these benefits of solar thermal are huge, and not properly priced in electricity markets. He chairs a committee called the solar power and chemical energy systems executive, at the International Energy Agency, which examines barriers to implementing solar thermal. A major barrier is that these grid services are not properly recognised or priced, he says. “In some markets there are no market signals to value appropriately this contribution of dispatchability or the storage.” He says there are several examples of incentives that can provide premiums for systems that provide these services. Solar ambitions One way of correcting market failures is with government funding programs. As far as that goes, the stars might be aligning for Port Augusta’s solar ambitions. The South Australian government has said it wants to source all the energy the government uses from renewable sources, and has called for expressions of interest for industry to develop that capacity. SolarReserve says it has submitted a proposal. That could provide the power plant with a customer, but to get it off the ground, it would still need some further support. So far, activists and community groups have been calling for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to fund the facility’s construction with a grant. Over the past month, people from Port Augusta have been meeting with the politicians in Canberra, including with Malcolm Turnbull, urging them to support the project. Lisa Lumsden is a local councillor and member of a campaign group called RePower Port Augusta. Shortly after meeting the prime minister last month she said he seemed genuinely interested in the project. “He said he’d have a word with minister [Greg] Hunt about it,” says Lumsden. “SolarReserve is looking for a commitment from the Arena fund,” she says. “We are hoping that Arena will recommend to minister Hunt that he support the SolarReserve project so that it can get up.” Since SolarReserve is likely seeking more than $50m, Arena would need the minister’s blessing. But then this week Turnbull announced Arena would stop making grants, and instead offer financing and equity arrangements through a new Clean Energy Innovation Fund. At first that seemed like a setback, but then Turnbull specifically highlihgted the Port Augusta solar thermal project as the sort of thing the fund might support. “An example of a project could be a large-scale solar facility with storage in Port Augusta,” he said. As soon as that happened, locals and activists got excited. Repower Port Augusta called a press conference and Lumsden said: “This is a massive step forward for our community with the prime minister signalling the new Clean Energy Innovation Fund could be used to fund solar thermal with storage in Port Augusta.” As the media and renewables industry tries to figure out exactly what the renewables fund will mean, Lumsden is enthusiastic about the way things look. “We have a company willing to build it, the South Australian government wants to buy clean power and now we’ve had our strongest statement of support yet from the federal government. It really feels like we can make solar thermal happen for Port Augusta.” All the while, the trainloads of coal keep depleting the last of the stockpile at Leigh Creek, delivering it to Port Augusta. For another six weeks or so, that will continue, until the last of it is burned and the power station is switched off. Meanwhile, the sun will keep shining on Port Augusta and whether or not that’s used to power its future now seems in the hands of government. “We’re going to bust our guts to make it happen,” says Lumsden."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/feb/22/renewable-energy-cities-solar-wind-rio-delhi-nairobi-london-arup-vestas","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-22T08:03:09Z","webTitle":"What next for renewables in cities? – the expert view","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/22/renewable-energy-cities-solar-wind-rio-delhi-nairobi-london-arup-vestas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/22/renewable-energy-cities-solar-wind-rio-delhi-nairobi-london-arup-vestas","fields":{"headline":"What next for renewables in cities? – the expert view","bodyText":"As renewable energy projects are rolled out in cities around the world, we spoke to companies and organisations working in the sector to find out what’s happening and what to expect. Here’s what they said. ‘It’s cheaper than the alternatives’ – Sarah Chapman, CEO, Faro Energy In an increasing number of cities around the world, businesses are switching to rooftop solar. The trend started in rich countries, where solar has been subsidised, but as the cost of solar has come down it has become cost-competitive in sunny cities from Rio de Janeiro to Delhi to Nairobi. Companies with large energy demand and available roof space are making the switch not just because it’s greener but also because it’s cheaper than the alternatives. Where the grid is unreliable, it also reduces reliance on expensive diesel generators. In countries like the US, Germany and the UK, the roll-out of solar has been fuelled by third-party ownership, which means the company doesn’t have to pay for the system upfront and instead pays monthly, as it would its normal electricity bill. This model is now starting to be adopted in some emerging markets and is making solar a viable choice for a much wider range of companies. Faro Energy funds distributed solar projects in Latin America such as one on the roof of the new aquarium in Rio de Janeiro. ‘New opportunities for entrepreneurs’ – Amit Ronen, director, GW Solar Institute A US Department of Energy report (pdf) issued last year analysed the solar energy-generating potential of 128 American cities and concluded that rooftop solar could technically meet 39% of total US electricity demand. However, while technically possible, the majority of Americans are unable to enjoy the benefits of solar ownership because, among other reasons, their rooftops are unsuitable, they are renters, or they can’t afford upfront installation costs. These factors are particularly prevalent in city environments and within lower-income communities, which make up 40% of US households but account for less than 5% of solar installations. An emerging new business model, community solar, promises to break through those barriers by letting consumers buy or lease a portion of an off-site solar array – usually a project of tens or hundreds of kilowatts connected to the consumer’s local distribution grid – or its output with little or no money down and at prices below prevailing electricity rates. Community solar faces a range of legal, regulatory and financial barriers, largely stemming from the attempt to fit this new model into a century-old system designed for utilities operating large centralised facilities. But a number of enterprising businesses are taking up the challenge and the prospects look good. While only 6 MW (paywall) of community solar were installed in 2013, today there are nearly 3 GW of projects in development. That means lots of new opportunities for entrepreneurs and options for urban residents to support renewable energy. GW Solar Institute is a research facility focused on the economic, technical and public policy issues associated with the development and deployment of solar energy. ‘Commercial financing can assist’ – Justin Wimbush, associate director and head of renewables, Arup In parts of the world where cities have a role in the purchase and selling on of electricity, they can require some or all of it to be sourced from local renewable energy generators. However, even with the recent significant reductions in the cost of technologies such as wind and PV, such arrangements may only work if adequate Power Purchase Agreements can be negotiated. Other barriers to the development of renewable installations include matters such as the evolution of local legislation to allow the use of embedded generation – in other words, the generation of energy within the urban environment. Cities with weak or poorly maintained electricity networks are often reluctant to allow electricity to be exported from a building into the city’s electricity distribution grid, or will provide little or no financial return for such electricity, which may significantly reduce the viability of the installation. This is particularly the case where the available renewable resource, such as sunshine, does not occur when energy is required, such as with many residential applications. Where energy storage can be made a part of the solution, this problem can be overcome. Where financial barriers are hindering the development of renewable energy projects, commercial financing can assist. The London Energy Efficiency Fund, for example, funds renewable energy projects as well as energy efficiency projects. Innovative funding models such as the use of pay-as-you-go mobile phone type funding is now being used by some private sector developers to install renewables in previously un-electrified parts of the world, providing the local population with lower cost electricity compared to the alternatives, namely electricity from diesel generators. Arup is an independent firm of designers, planners, engineers, consultants and technical specialists. ‘The main challenge is system stability’ – Morten Dyrholm, group senior vice president, Vestas The main challenge for renewable energy adoption is no longer costs but system stability. How do we ensure that people, businesses and cities have the power they need when they need it? Obviously we need the capacity to fulfil demand, but equally importantly we need markets that can provide the necessary electricity when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining. This means solutions that can help variable generation to interact more fluently with the energy system, such as storing electricity, managing demand and giving stability to the grid. A good example is Denmark, which had a wind penetration rate of more than 40% in 2015. The recipe there includes strong transmission grids and effective and transparent power markets. Combining renewables with other generation technologies that easily can be ramped up and down, and the use of specialised wind-forecasting tools are also key factors. Vestas designs, manufactures, installs and services wind turbines around the world.

Known as “Sprites”, the miniature satellites are just 3.5cm x 3.5cm and carry radios, sensors and computers, with each device powered by sunlight and weighing just four grams. While nanosatellites known as CubeSats have previously been sent into space, such systems have a mass thousands of times that of the Sprites, weighing more than 1kg. Scientists say the latest development is an important a precursor to an ambitious attempt to send space probes to planets beyond our solar system, dubbed Breakthrough Starshot. “This is a new frontier of tiny, gram-scale spacecraft” said Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University, chair of the advisory committee for the Breakthrough Starshot Initiative. The Sprites, Loeb adds, are also cheap. “Each of them is only tens of dollars in cost,” he said. Announced last year by Stephen Hawking and Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner, who has put $100m into funding the first five years of the project, Breakthrough Starshot’s goal is to develop chips with a weight of roughly one gram and fit them to a lightweight sail before propelling them through space with a 100-billion watt laser. “The reason one needs to push the weight down is because in order to reach the nearest stars within our lifetime, the spacecraft needs to move at a fraction of the speed of light – a fifth of the speed of light or so,” said Loeb. While Sprites have previously been carried on board the International Space Station, this is the first demonstration that it is possible to launch such a lightweight miniaturised satellite into space and communicate with it. The Sprite project is led by Zac Manchester, now a researcher working with Loeb at Harvard University, who began work on the spacecraft almost a decade ago, before the project became part of the Breakthrough Starshot effort. Two Sprites are currently glued to the outside of the Latvian Venta satellite and the Italian Max Valier satellite, small systems built by the Germany-based company OHB System AG and launched together in June. “I actually ended up flying to Germany with these things in my carry-on,” said Manchester. Four Sprites are also travelling inside the Max Valier satellite and are designed to be released into space – although that plan is up in the air given a technical hitch in communication with the Italian satellite. Michael Garrett, director of Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, welcomed the success of the Sprites. “I find it quite surprising but exciting as well,” he said, pointing out that the Sprites show such chips are stable in space, can harness solar energy, and are able to communicate. “Normally this is happening with satellites which are the size of a big mini-van, or even bigger than that,” he added The Breakthrough Starshot project relies on the miniaturisation of technology, and plans to use a tiny chip to host a number of instruments, including navigation equipment and a camera. However, the communication system on the device will be laser-based, rather than relying on radio-waves as the Sprites do. “If someone had talked to me two years about sending anything to the nearest star I would have thought that was a bit of a joke to be honest,” said Garrett. “I suppose I had never really grasped the concept that nowadays we can put lots and lots of complexity onto just a computer chip that weighs hardly anything.” The idea is that by sending such tiny spacecraft to planets orbiting nearby stars, it will be possible to collect data which could help to shed light on the possibility of life beyond Earth. The top destination for such a mission is our nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, within which is the star Proxima Centauri which is orbited by the planet Proxima b. Not only is Proxima b thought to be a rocky planet, but it is also within the so-called “habitable zone”, the distance from a star at which liquid water might exist, which has caused much excitement in the search for extraterrestrial life. Martin Rees, astronomer royal and emeritus professor of cosmology and astrophysics at the University of Cambridge, described the success of the Sprites as a huge development for miniaturised spacecraft. While Rees believes sending tiny space probes to nearby star systems is “very futuristic”, he says the satellites could open the door to new miniature devices to probe our own planet – and the solar system. “You [could] have very large numbers of tiny probes monitoring Saturn and its moon etc in more detail than we have done up till now, simply because of the advances we are familiar with every day from mobile phones,” he said, pointing out that the technology on board the Cassini spacecraft currently studying the planet is decades old. Loeb believes it will take 20 years for the Breakthrough Starshot space probes to be developed, and another 20 for them to reach the Alpha Centauri system, but he says the wait will be worth it. “You can think of it as the modern incarnation of building the pyramids,” he said. “My personal hope is that once we have a spacecraft leaving the solar system we get a message back saying ‘welcome to the interstellar club’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/mar/24/20-best-campsites-europe-camping-greece-france-spain","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"20 of the best campsites in Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/mar/24/20-best-campsites-europe-camping-greece-france-spain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/mar/24/20-best-campsites-europe-camping-greece-france-spain","fields":{"headline":"20 of the best campsites in Europe","bodyText":"Le Clos du Lac, Provence, France Setting Mountains Pitches 50 Activities Fishing, swimming Perched at 1,485 metres on the edge of Écrins national park, this mountain site offers Instagrammable views from the tent door and a range of picture-perfect outdoor experiences.

For a true eco-break, the train stops a couple of kilometres away at Sistiana. • Pitch for two from €10.50, campingcarso.com Camping Camino de Santiago, Burgos, Spain Setting Countryside Pitches 40 Activities Birding, cycling, pilgrim-watching It may be named after the (at least) 500-mile pilgrim path to Santiago de Compestela in Galicia, north-west Spain, but blisters, backpacks and offerings to St James are not requirements for a stay here. In fact, the focus is very much on taking it easy. From an on-site restaurant to fresh-baked goods delivered daily, the owners do what they can to make staying in one place heavenly. There’s occasional guided birdwatching (the area is home to 361 species), pilgrims to spot, and pitches are divided by hedges for privacy. • Pitch from €4.50, plus €5 per adult, campingcamino.com Campsite Port Massaluca, Catalonia, Spain Setting Riverside Pitches 10 Activities Fishing, kayaking, birdwatching Griffon vulture, alpine swift, peregrine falcon … If you’re already reaching for the binoculars, this Catalonian campsite, around 200km west of Barcelona, will not disappoint. At the confluence of the Matarraña and Ebro rivers, below the dramatic, sandy-coloured cliffs, all these birds can be spied nesting in the rocks above the campsite. If you’re more excited by zander, carp, bass, perch and catfish, then you’ll be in your element too, as it’s also the perfect site to fish – though there is competition from the local kingfishers, herons, cormorants and grebes, naturally. • From €9.30, camping-portmassaluca.es Quinta dos Moinhos, Braga, Portugal Setting Mountains Pitches 6 Activities Exploring, cycling It may only have six pitches but there’s plenty on offer at this site in northern Portugal: table tennis, boules, and mountain bike and kayak hire. The nearby village of Vila Nune is worth a meander – especially on Mondays, when the market is on – and slightly further away is Serra de Cabreira, which has hiking trails by the herd-load. Nearby are Alvão natural park and Peneda-Gerês national park. • Pitch from €8.50, plus €4.75 per adult, quinta-dos-moinhos.com Campsite Nature Ferie, Hals, Denmark Setting Beach Pitches 28 Activities Cycling, canoeing, swimming If you thought private beaches were the preserve of five-star hotel guests, think again.

The item is shifted off its shelf by human or robot and on to a chain of delivery mechanisms that takes it to your door. That item, and millions others like it, plus the machinery that handles them, needs space. The more we shop online, the more such space is needed. You’ll know all this, I expect, but you may only be dimly aware of the physical consequences: very big boxes, getting bigger and more numerous. Higher, too, as robotic distribution systems allow goods to be piled further from the ground than before. These boxes are of such importance that some are classed as “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, which means that national government rather than local authorities give them planning permission. Some are shrouded in secrecy. They are where the virtual becomes physical, with a vengeance. Their scale challenges the conventions of town and country planning, pushing their designers and creators to find more or less convincing ways to respond. Imagine the space that is used to store and display a product in a traditional shop, and then imagine great dollops of it sucked from almost every high street and supermarket in the land to a centralised facility. Add it to the long-established need for physical shops to warehouse their goods. You end up with something like Dirft – the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal – near Rugby, or the Magna Parks in Milton Keynes and Lutterworth: town-sized agglomerations, containing thousands of workers, made up of very big sheds. They are called distribution centres, which differ from what used to be called warehouses in the degree to which the buildings are integrated into logistical networks of trucks, trains, the internet and subsidiary distribution points. Dirft and the Magna Parks are within what, with unexpected romance, is called the “golden triangle”, a land of sheds, roads and marketing gerunds (such as Eddie Stobart’s “delivering sustainable distribution”) laid over the fields and towns of old England. In some accounts the triangle’s points are Leicester, Coventry and Milton Keynes and in others its sides are the M1, M6 and M42 motorways, but in either case it describes an area from where 85% of the population of Great Britain can be reached in four and a half hours, which is the maximum time an HGV driver can travel without taking a break. In other words, if you order a set of John Lewis bathroom towels in Southampton, Cardiff or Manchester, it will come from the same big box in Milton Keynes. The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas argues that the modern countryside is now divided into two types: on the one hand industrialised agriculture with the big structures that serve it, on the other landscapes preserved for their picturesque beauty. Dirft confirms his point. It stands close to the pretty Northamptonshire village of Crick, with its medieval church of St Margaret’s (Grade I listed, notable Romanesque font), also to the pleasant rolling countryside of Warwickshire (Shakespeare’s county, as the sign on the border says). Dirft itself consists of colossal distribution centres from which retailers dispatch their produce, via the nearby M1, across the country. Here is an abstracted high street of the nation in which the buyable contents of a home – food, furnishings, hardware, clothes – are translated into vast labelled containers: Tesco, Sainsburys, Bathstore, Halfords. The Dirft development’s origins lie in the mid-90s, when a freight rail connection was established, via Felixstowe docks and the then new Channel tunnel, into something called the Trans-European Transport Network. As the area had already been designated, in 1978, as a “motorway orientated growth point” the addition of the railport made it exceptionally fertile ground for the bumper crops of big sheds that then started to blossom there. There are now more than 6m sq ft of building with another 7.7m on the way. Dirft is no prettier than its name and doesn’t claim to be so. It is a landscape of those mute boxes and of the roads, loading areas and parking zones they need to sustain them, the earth vigorously reshaped to make the flat platforms on which they stand. It is made of fences, berms and security gates, of young trees in their protective tubes and gnarled old ones, survivors of the site’s former rural life. A pitched-roofed Ibis hotel adds a note of forlorn domesticity. Wind turbines turn. You couldn’t call it country or town: it is a node, a zone. It approaches a sort of sublime, you could say, in which the vast whiteish rectangles resemble conceptual art and the engineered terrain unwittingly becomes land art. Its scale is that of the national and international networks of which it is part, not the locality. The complex is surprisingly uncontentious, given its size and impact, among the local community. “It is positive”, says Josie Flavell of Crick parish council “in that a number of residents are employed by the many companies at Dirft.” She is pleased that Prologis, the company that owns the site, contributes towards two police community support officers, organises litter removal, pays for cycling and pedestrian routes and financed a heritage board to be placed at the site of the old Kilsby and Crick railway. Simon Bowers, of Daventry district council, also likes the jobs it brings. “It’s a valued part of the local economy,” he says. “It’s an appropriate development that does no real harm.” But, in a country where land is as constrained as in Britain, where it is a struggle to find space for other such essentials as new housing, the growth of big sheds is particularly hard to accommodate. If it is a fast-moving business, wherein a building 10 times the volume of St Paul’s Cathedral might go up in six months, it might take a decade to assemble a site out of former farmland, and win planning permission for it. In Lutterworth there is a campaign group called Magna Park Is Big Enough, which in January persuaded the local council to refuse, by a margin of two votes, a planned expansion. One meeting of the group was held in a hangar to accommodate the number of protesters. There is, therefore, a motivation to “innovate in a mindful and respectful way”, as Gazeley, owner of the Magna Parks, put it. Last year Creative Review magazine spotted a trend, a “new breed of superstructures trying very hard to disappear”. Off the M5, for example, near Bridgwater in Somerset, a huge Morrisons distribution centre is clad in long horizontal strips of varying shades of green, the better to blend with the lush West Country landscape. Magna Park in Milton Keynes, home to John Lewis, Waitrose and River Island, a mile-plus-long, 4m sq ft array, is uniformly banded with gradations of blue, from dark at the bottom to pale at the top. The intention is that it will fade into the sky. It depends on the location, explains Tim Ward of Chetwoods, the architects of the Milton Keynes Magna Park and a number of other distribution centres. If the structures are generally viewed with landscape behind, green works well; if sky, blue is better. There is, he says, some art to the choice of tones that includes a knowledge of the latest developments in the technology of colour. Chetwoods are keen to stress that they don’t want the structures to disappear, exactly – a futile task, given the enormous size of the buildings – but rather to be less intrusive. Indeed, you are conscious of Magna Park Milton Keynes from miles around – an insistent, astounding, blueish presence that occupies the horizon from end to end, an alternative atmospheric that keeps reappearing down country lanes, from new housing estates and across fields. Or, if you are driving along the M1, it is an azure-cerulean abstraction, flipping past the edge of vision for an appreciable interval of time. The striking thing about it is less the breaking-up of its bulk than the consistency of the pattern across such an expanse of surface. There may never before have been so much synthetic blueness in one place. Colour, in any case, only gets you so far. Gazeley like to talk of the million trees they have planted at Lutterworth to create a publicly accessible “Magna Wood” and “the wildlife-rich Mere Lane Lagoon fishing lake.” At Milton Keynes a pond captures and attenuates the rainwater that falls on the development’s expanses of roof. There are swans, moorhens and many species of tree. There is a “bee hotel”. There is an uplifting, if artistically dubious, statue of the Olympic long jumper Greg Rutherford on the roundabout at the entrance to the complex. As befits the home of Waitrose, Magna Park has a palpable quality and coherence in its layout, but even blunt Dirft has measures to buffer its impact with landscape. Gazeley are particularly proud of Altitude, a new distribution centre on their Milton Keynes site that is not only an unusually high 21 metres but also has a roof ready to be covered by photovoltaic cells, at such time as they become economically viable. The health and wellbeing of employees will be supported by such things as good lighting and ventilation and reindeer moss growing on living walls inside the building. New technology is reducing the number of jobs in the business, I’m told, but many of those that remain are becoming more skilled, which means that companies have to try harder to attract good staff. Laurie Chetwood of Chetwoods says that distribution centres, which are among the most single-minded of building types, must now acquire a “duality of purpose”, which means things such as making running tracks out of the fire engine lanes that surround the boxes. He talks of cladding that can double as batteries to store solar energy gathered on the roof. One day, maybe, it might be possible to charge electric trucks with it, which would mitigate the rather obvious ecological drawbacks of dispatching thousands of HGVs across the country every day. Simple as they may look, distribution centres are sophisticated structures. The machinery that moves stuff around is constantly evolving. Their playing field-sized floors have to be exceptionally level, as small unevenness could cause the high fork-lift trucks they use to lean unacceptably at the top. Years of competition have made their structure as spare and economical as can be. Architects such as Chetwoods have to reconcile all this with the wishes of users (who might want something tailored to their needs) and of investors, who will want a structure to be adaptable to future users. It is tempting to say that these buildings make the internet visible, except that their visibility is strictly limited. Sometimes they get into the news when reporters, posing as warehouse workers, bring news of working conditions inside. You can get a glimmer on Google, for example from employee reviews of Primark’s warehouse, which sits like an acropolis on a raised earthwork in Northamptonshire: “they’re treating a people like nothing,” says one in imperfect English; “they beautiful lied on induction how much they cares about worker, don’t believe them.” The buildings, however, remain notably blank, giving almost no clue of their busy inner lives. Some users and owners are dismissive of press inquiries to a degree unusual in big, public relations-conscious companies. Tesco refused a request to see inside their Dirft base, which was possibly not surprising, but also to answer simple questions, such as: what are its dimensions? For the writer Carolyn Steel, whose book Hungry City: How Food Shapes Our Lives examines the relationship of society to food, this secrecy is the antithesis of the more public processes by which food once progressed from field to market to kitchen to plate. “The exchange of food used to bring people together,” she says. “Now the process is designed to exclude the human”. But distribution centres manifest the world we have chosen and had chosen for us, in return for efficiency and convenience, in which a product appears in the home by ever more inscrutable magic. Their scale and growth are a consequence of the fact that all that physicality and volume that the virtual world displaces has to go somewhere. It’s welcome that architects and developers should try to make something of them and to mitigate their impact with woods, ponds and indeed coloured bands. But, short of a dramatic restructuring of the economic, technical and social basis of the modern world, these uncompromising building types will only become more essential to our lives. The contrast between what was previously thought of as natural and urban landscape will only become more stark."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/jan/31/tesla-battery-farm-california-energy-elon-musk","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-31T19:18:50Z","webTitle":"Tesla moves beyond electric cars with new California battery farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/31/tesla-battery-farm-california-energy-elon-musk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/31/tesla-battery-farm-california-energy-elon-musk","fields":{"headline":"Tesla moves beyond electric cars with new California battery farm","bodyText":"From the road, the close to 400 white industrial boxes packed into 1.5 acres of barren land in Ontario, California, a little more than 40 miles from downtown Los Angeles, look like standard electrical equipment. They’re surrounded by a metal fence, stand on concrete pads and sit under long electrical lines. But take a closer look and you’ll notice the bright red coloring and gray logo of electric car company Tesla on the sides. And inside the boxes are thousands of battery cells – the same ones that are used in Tesla’s electric cars – made by the company in its massive $5bn Tesla Gigafactory outside of Reno, Nevada. This spot, located at the Mira Loma substation of Southern California Edison, hosts the biggest battery farm Tesla has built for a power company. Southern California Edison will use the battery farm, which has been operating since December and is one of the biggest in the world, to store energy and meet spikes in demand – like on hot summer afternoons when buildings start to crank up the air conditioning. Tesla’s project has a capacity of 20 megawatts and is designed to discharge 80-megawatt hours of electricity in four-hour periods. It contains enough batteries to run about 1,000 Tesla cars, and the equivalent energy to supply power to 15,000 homes for four hours. The company declined to disclose the project’s cost. The project marks an important point in Tesla’s strategy to expand beyond the electric car business. Developing battery packs is a core expertise for the company, which is designing packs for homes, businesses and utilities. It markets them partly as a way to store solar electricity for use after sundown, a pitch that works well for states with a booming solar energy market such as California. Battery systems built for power companies can serve more than one purpose. A utility can avoid blackouts by charging them up when its natural gas power plants, or solar and wind farms, produce more electricity than needed, and draw from them when the power plants aren’t able to keep up with demand. Edison and other California utilities hired Tesla and a few other battery farm builders after an important natural gas reservoir near Los Angeles, called Aliso Canyon, closed following a huge leak and massive environmental disaster in late 2015. The leak forced thousands of people in nearby neighborhoods to evacuate. It also left utilities worried about how they’d meet the peak electricity demands of coming summers if they weren’t able to dip into the natural gas storage whenever they need fuel to produce power. They couldn’t always get natural gas shipment from other suppliers quick enough to meet a sharp rise in electricity consumption. As a result, the California Public Utilities Commission approved 100 megawatts of energy storage projects for both Southern California Edison and also San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. The commission also asked for the projects to be built quickly, before the end of 2016. Other energy storage projects that have been built since include a 37.5-megawatt project in San Diego County by AES Energy Storage, which used lithium-ion batteries from Samsung. AES has completed the project, which is going through the commissioning phase. AES also plans to build a 100-megawatt project for Southern California Edison in Long Beach in 2020. Even before the Aliso Canyon disaster, the commission had already recognized the benefit of using energy storage to manage supply and demand and expected it to become an important component in the state’s plan to replace fossil fuel energy with renewables. The commission, which requires the state’s three big utilities to add more wind and solar energy to their supplies over time, also set a statement energy storage target of 1,325 megawatts by 2020. Surrounded by rows of batteries at a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the project on Monday, Southern California Edison’s CEO Kevin Payne said the Tesla project is important because “it validates that energy storage can be part of the energy mix now” and is “a great reminder of how fast technology is changing the electric power industry”. This latest crop of energy storage projects use a new generation of lithium-ion batteries. Historically, batteries were too expensive for energy storage, but their prices have dropped dramatically in recent years, thanks to their mass production by companies such as Panasonic, Tesla and Samsung. Companies that buy lithium-ion batteries have been reporting drops in prices of 70% over the past two years. Tesla has said it plans to lower its battery prices by 30% by expanding production inside its Gigafactory. At the event on Monday, Tesla’s co-founder and chief technology officer JB Straubel said: “Storage has been missing on the grid since it was invented.” Tesla is counting on the energy storage market as an important source of revenue and built its giant factory with that in mind. The company believes its expertise in engineering and building electric cars sets itself apart from other battery farm developers. Tesla has been developing battery packs for a decade and improved the technology that manages the batteries temperatures, which can be high enough to pose a fire risk. Overheating is a well known problem for lithium-ion batteries, which require insulating materials and software to keep them running cool. A battery farm built next to a wind farm in Hawaii by a now-bankrupt company caught fire in 2012 and temporarily put a dampener on the energy storage market. Tesla has been building another battery farm on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, and has projects in Connecticut, North Carolina, New Zealand and the UK. The company is looking for opportunities to build battery farms outside of California, including the East Coast and countries such as Germany, Australia and Japan. Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk has said in the past that the company’s energy storage business could one day be bigger than its car business."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/2017/sep/25/charlottesvilles-after-neo-nazis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T19:25:29Z","webTitle":"Charlottesville's white awakening: 'We were living in a bubble,' say residents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/25/charlottesvilles-after-neo-nazis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/25/charlottesvilles-after-neo-nazis","fields":{"headline":"Charlottesville's white awakening: 'We were living in a bubble,' say residents","bodyText":"Inside the University of Virginia’s Scott Stadium, a succession of pop stars were telling local residents that “Love trumps hate” and “You will not dethrone love.” Dave Matthews, Pharrell Williams, Ariana Grande and Justin Timberlake were holding a free concert to help Charlottesville recover from the violent white supremacist and neo-Nazi protests that rocked the town last month. But as he smoked a cigarette by the stadium concession stands Sunday evening, Jack (who did not want his last name used) wasn’t talking about love. He was talking about his vote. The 25-year-old, who has lived in Charlottesville most of his life, is a conservative in a liberal town. He said he had voted for Donald Trump, hoping that a political outsider would bring change. Then white supremacists had marched across his hometown carrying torches and chanting “You will not replace us” and “Jews will not replace us.” They carried guns and wore helmets and shields and fought with anti-fascists in the streets, generating news footage viewed around the world. As a white man, the kind of American these far-right groups claimed to represent, “I felt ashamed,” he said. His friends who are not white had been terrified, wondering if they would be safe going outside or walking around. In response, Trump, the president he had supported, repeatedly blamed “both sides” and “many sides” and said there were “very fine people” who marched alongside the neo-Nazis. Jack said he didn’t know if any mainstream conservatives had marched alongside neo-Nazis on 12 August. “If I saw a Nazi flag go up, I would be out of there,” he said. Charlottesville was definitely not the first time Trump had said something that made Jack uncomfortable, and it was was not the first time friends had shared their fears with him about how their race might make them vulnerable. When it came to police brutality, Jack said, he listened, but he also had his own relationship with the police as authority figures, and wanted to believe that most police officers would not simply racially profile people. “This was different,” he said. The white supremacists’ attitude towards other races was absolutely clear. Whether Trump was a white supremacist himself, he said, he did not know. But together with Trump’s “Rocket Man” jabs at North Korea, the president’s reaction to Charlottesville had convinced him that he would not be voting for Trump again, and that he needed to vet his candidates more carefully in the future. On Sunday, as tens of thousands of locals filled stadium seats and clustered on the field in front of the stage, the mood was relaxed and upbeat. But, like Jack, some white Charlottesville residents said that that watching fascists march through their streets had been a wake-up call. “It opened our eyes,” said Pat Sury, who lives outside Charlottesville. “That it’s here as well as everywhere else. We were living in a bubble.” “I think it got everybody talking a lot more about what’s going on in our community,” said Rosanna Lavin, 62, sitting with Sury and other friends at a small tailgating party in the parking lot. “We cannot be blind to some of the issues that we really don’t deal with,” including “alt-right hatred” and “race relations”. At work, Lavin said, she has tried to talk about race more with her colleagues of color. “I think we’re too afraid to approach subjects sometimes and get honest reactions,” she said. But the “bits and pieces” of conversation had not yet produced steps forward other than overall support. Conversations about racism “are not the funnest conversations to have or the easiest,” but they were happening with more urgency now, said Devin Welch, 33, who works for a solar energy company in Charlottesville, at a different tailgate party. Before the white supremacist protests, local entrepreneurs had already been discussing how to support and fund a more diverse set of start-up founders, ensuring that venture capital funding did not just stay within white social networks. After the protests, it’s not just a priority – “now it’s top,” he said. Welch said he believed that what Charlottesville had witnessed was the “death gasps of a dying ideology,” not the growth of something new. Malcolm Wills, 20, and Fernando Garay, 19, said that protests in Charlottesville had appeared to make people more comfortable openly saying racist things, particularly on Facebook. Both young men said they had been shocked to watch acquaintances defend white supremacists online, and that people they knew talked earnestly about their concerns about white people becoming a minority. The tension and anxiety of the first days after the white supremacists’ protests had faded, Wills said. The two young men said they hoped that if the neo-Nazis came back, the town would choose to let them protest without much reaction, rather than feeding their agenda with attention. A black fourth-year student at the University of Virginia, who said she did not want to give her name, said she was trying to enjoy her last year of university, and not let what happened define her experience. That wasn’t easy. As a peer counselor to younger students of color, she said she has fielded many questions from first-years about whether they should transfer to another school. She said she advised them to stay. “Sadly, wherever you are in America, you can probably experience these things,” she said. Inside the stadium, Susan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer, the young woman killed when an alleged white supremacist drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, had received a standing ovation from the audience at the beginning of the concert, and urged listeners to continue her daughter’s legacy by showing up to confront hatred and discrimination. “Tragically, because Heather stood bravely against racism and hatred, she was taken from us,” Bro told the crowd, asking them to “turn our righteous anger into action.” Her daughter “loved humanity with an open heart. That’s what gave her the strength and compassion to stand up with her friends against hate. As Heather said, if you’re not outraged, you’re not paying attention.” Ariana Grande, whose young fans were targeted by a suicide bomber in Manchester in May, leaving 22 people killed and dozens more wounded, struck a similar note between her sets at the concert. The pop singer, who just finished a world tour, came to Charlottesville to participate in her second benefit concert following an act of terror in the space of just four months. She had hosted her own benefit, One Love Manchester, in June. America’s president usually serves as the country’s consoler-in-chief. But Trump, who had branded terrorists “evil losers” after the Manchester attack, had not come to Charlottesville to offer support. So it was the 24-year-old pop singer who took on that rhetorical role, mixing consolation with a reminder of their shared values. “I want to tell you how proud I am to be part of a generation that is so passionate about making a change,” she told the crowd. “Keep using your voices and making this a safer place for each other.” This article was amended on 26 September 2017 to remove the full name and photograph of an interviewee at their request."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/sep/06/state-schools-face-solar-tax-hike-but-private-schools-exempted","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-06T15:18:40Z","webTitle":"State schools face solar tax hike - but private schools exempted","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/06/state-schools-face-solar-tax-hike-but-private-schools-exempted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/06/state-schools-face-solar-tax-hike-but-private-schools-exempted","fields":{"headline":"State schools face solar tax hike - but private schools exempted","bodyText":"Many state schools with solar panels are set to be hit with a tax hike, according to government plans, but private schools, free schools and academies will not be affected due to their charitable status. Campaigners say the move will end the installation of solar energy for most schools. The government proposes to end an exemption for small solar panel installations (less than 50 kilowatts) and charge business rates on them from April 2017. The charity 10:10 has calculated this will cost schools more than £820 a year for the average 10kW installation and, combined with recent cuts to the subsidy paid for rooftop solar energy, make future projects risky or uneconomic. As recently as September 2015, schools could expect to pay back the costs of installation in five to eight years, but the new regime would mean payback times of at least 12 years and perhaps never, 10:10 says. The changes to subsidies, which are estimated to have cost 12,000 jobs nationwide, have already forced 10:10 to close its Solar Schools programme, which had installed more than 2,000 panels on 80 schools since 2011, working with more than 30,000 pupils. “This new tax hike is just nonsensical,” said Cecily Spelling, at 10:10. “It’s punishing those that have already installed solar and discouraging more in the future. It’s about so much more than just generating energy - it brings communities together and gets people excited about the positive things they can do to tackle climate change. “It’s also a brilliant resource for science, technology and maths education. It’s so sad that only a very few, select schools will be able to experience this kind of solar-powered magic in the future. It is just so unjust.” Research conducted for Nesta and Solar Schools found participants felt more engaged in taking action on climate change, with more than 70% changing their behaviour to save energy. Adam Stanley, assistant headteacher at Liss primary school in Hampshire, said: “The prime reason [for installing solar panels] was the attraction of a clean sustainable form of energy, which sent out a very clear message that we were serious about looking after the environment.” He said the subsidy cuts have already discouraged other schools from following suit. “The news that the government now intends to increase business rates fills me with despair. Not only will we struggle to break even on our investment, but by the exemption of schools with charitable status you are creating a two tier system which penalises local authority schools. I urge [ministers] to rethink this rash decision.” Winchester College is among the private schools which recently installed solar energy, adding 500 panels to its rooftops. Samantha Williams, headteacher of Middleton primary school in Leeds, said: “Installing solar on our roof has been a great thing for the school, the pupils and the community. The changes to the feed-in tariff were bad enough but the new business rates being thrown into the mix too will stop schools in their tracks and punish those around the country who have already done the right thing and installed.” The proposed change in business rates will also affect many solar installations on commercial buildings larger than the 50kW exemption, hiking up charges by six to eight times, according to the Solar Trade Association (STA). The STA says there are already 23,000 non-domestic rooftop installations that would be affected and is calling on the government to make all self-owned rooftop solar panels exempt from business rates. A government spokesperson said: “Solar deployment is a UK success story with almost 11GW of capacity now installed, and the government is committed to providing secure, clean and affordable energy now and in the future.” He said: “Business rates are based on valuations from the independent Valuation Office Agency. We will look closely at the impacts of the forthcoming valuation, and consult on how to put the right support in place for businesses to adjust to any changes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/jun/28/solar-power-energy-us-utilities-environment-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-28T16:29:31Z","webTitle":"Here comes the sun: US solar power market hits all-time high","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/28/solar-power-energy-us-utilities-environment-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/28/solar-power-energy-us-utilities-environment-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Here comes the sun: US solar power market hits all-time high","bodyText":"Solar energy in the US has had a rocky existence. Ever since Ronald Reagan symbolically removed Jimmy Carter’s solar panels from the White House roof in 1986, federal policy has been unpredictable, such that manufacturers and consumers could never depend on reliable incentives to produce and install solar energy systems. Remarkably, the US solar energy industry is now entering what may be its most prosperous decade ever, thanks to a new wave of federal and state policies and positive economics in the industry, both at home and abroad. “I think it will actually be bigger than people are projecting,” says Jigar Shah, president and co-founder of Generate Capital, a clean energy investment firm based in San Francisco. “The solar industry is booming right now.” The US solar industry expects to install 14.5 gigawatts of solar power in 2016, a 94% increase over the record 7.5 gigawatts last year, according to a new market report by GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association. Revenues from solar installations also increased 21% from 2014 to more than $22bn in 2015. For the first time, more solar systems came online than natural gas power plants – the top source of electricity in the US – in 2015, as measured in megawatts, said Justin Baca, vice president of markets and research at the Solar Energy Industries Association. This year, new solar is expected to surpass installations of all other sources, said the US Energy Information Administration. The rise of solar energy use, especially by homes and businesses with panels on their roofs, is gradually transforming the electricity industry. For more than a century, power plant owners and utilities have controlled the energy delivery service, and some of them enjoy a monopoly. “We were just a tiny little speck 10 years ago, and now we are really up there with the major established generating technologies,” said Baca. “It’s amazing.” Sunny path What’s behind all this? A federal tax credit has played a key role: it enables home and business owners to take off 30% of the price of their solar energy systems from their income taxes. Congress renewed the tax credit last December. Another factor is cost. It is simply a lot cheaper to install solar these days, largely because cost of components have declined considerably. The wholesale price of a solar panel today is about $0.65 per watt, compared with $0.74 per watt a year ago and $4 per watt in 2008. The steep decline in prices began initially in Germany. In 2000, Germany adopted policies that heavily subsidized solar power by adding a special charge on consumer utility bills. Utilities use the money collected from that special charge to pay higher rates for solar energy as part of a government policy to promote renewable energy. The higher rates created a huge demand for solar panels, driving manufacturers to compete for those dollars and other countries to institute similar policies. Until last year, it was the largest solar energy producing country in the world. “They created a massive demand for solar, and manufacturers around the world started stepping up to that,” Baca said. “Prior to that, a lot of solar panels were still largely made by hand. But the scale that manufacturers started growing to allowed a little bit more automation.” Then China, where labor costs were lower, rose to become a mighty manufacturing force. Chinese manufacturers built massive factories to make solar panels, drove down the prices for solar panels and forced more than a hundred of its competitors in Europe, US and even within China to go bankrupt. The fallout hurt so many businesses that the US government imposed tariffs on Chinese-made solar panels after determining that Chinese manufacturers were pricing their products at below fair-market values. The tariffs and increasing domestic demand have boosted manufacturing jobs in the US, which is now one of the top five nations for solar panel producers behind China, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. “Now the market’s so large you can actually sustain the large manufacturing plants and support the product locally,” said Shah. One example is SolarCity, which is building a giant new solar panel factory in Buffalo, New York. The facility, expected to be in operation later this year, plans to employ 3,500 people. It will produce panels primarily for SolarCity’s own projects around the world. Declines in other sources of electricity generation has also helped solar’s growing popularity. The coal business suffered historic losses in 2015 as concern about its greenhouse gas emissions took hold. Just 3 megawatts of new coal generation came online in 2015, compared to about 2,600 megawatts for solar, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Dark clouds ahead? Although the solar market is booming overall, its reliance on government incentives makes it vulnerable to the whims of policymakers. In Nevada, once considered a role model for solar development and a national leader for solar jobs per capita, the state Public Utilities Commission approved a major rollback of solar subsidies and policies last December. The commission voted in response to a complaint by the state’s largest utility, NV Energy, which contended that the subsidy – and the billing process required for the program – threatened its profitability. That change prompted SolarCity, one of America’s largest solar companies, to stop selling and installing new systems in Nevada and take some 550 jobs with it. Another company, Sunrun, did the same. As a result, the industry association expects Nevada to drop from the fifth-largest state for residential solar installations in 2015 to 31st by the end of this year. Robert Boehm, director of the Center for Energy Research at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, said the changes could mean trouble ahead for the industry as a whole. “My opinion is that many of the utilities in the US would like to do this in general,” Boehm said of curtailing state solar incentives and policies. “The whole rooftop solar thing has really gone south (in Nevada). We were amongst one of better states in terms of supporting rooftop solar. Now we are down amongst probably the worst.” Energy storage presents another obstacle. Solar remains a small contributor to the nation’s energy supply, accounting for less than 1% percent of total electricity production. As it grows and replaces traditional sources of energy, which can produce electricity any time, the need to make solar energy available even when the sun isn’t shining will only grow. Batteries are emerging to be the solution, but the technology and the manufacturing scale aren’t improving quick enough to make it financially feasible for the masses. One company, Tesla Motors, is attempting to address that problem by building a massive factory in Nevada to build lithium-ion batteries that will go into energy storage packs designed by Tesla for homes and businesses. Tesla is counting on battery sales to complement its electric car business. Its CEO, Elon Musk, surprised investors last week when he announced Tesla’s plan to buy SolarCity. Musk is the chairman of SolarCity’s board of directors. Boehm, who has solar panels on the roof of his home, said cheaper batteries will nudge more people to invest in solar equipment. “I’m kind of an enthusiast, but I wouldn’t do it right now,” Boehm said. “I don’t think the costs are right. We’re seeing the price of batteries come down and they’re improving the performance of them too. The movement’s in the right direction.” Shah takes a different view. Consumers shouldn’t have to worry about energy storage because they can always count on the utilities if their own solar panels aren’t producing energy, he said. Utilities, on the other hand, should invest in more renewable energy and storage to meet the growing demand and ensure a stable flow of electricity. “The amount of capital and investment going into to solar is at an all-time high,” Shah said. “I think the economics are clearly very good and we haven’t really even tapped but a very small percentage of our opportunities.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/jul/13/could-a-blockchain-based-electricity-network-change-the-energy-market","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-12T23:24:53Z","webTitle":"Could a blockchain-based electricity network change the energy market?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/13/could-a-blockchain-based-electricity-network-change-the-energy-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/13/could-a-blockchain-based-electricity-network-change-the-energy-market","fields":{"headline":"Could a blockchain-based electricity network change the energy market?","bodyText":"The blockchain. It is the much-hyped, virtually foolproof digital ledger that allows cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to flourish without the need for banks and governments, and promises to enable everything from the creation of ethical supply chains, to the ensuring of instantaneous payment on delivery of goods and services agreed to in immutable smart contracts. The techno-utopian predictions for this system ignore one crucial detail, however. The intense data processing required by blockchain pulls in an extraordinary amount of electricity, and widespread use of it would drag global energy markets into the abyss – and bring the world’s carbon emissions budget down with it. As an example, just a single bitcoin transaction has been calculated to devour as much energy as what powers 1.57 US households for a day – roughly 5,000 times more energy-hungry than a typical credit card payment. Would you prefer to pay by cash, credit or planet-wide blackout? The electricity sector will need to dramatically increase capacity and lower emissions to pave the way for the era of smart contracts – and interestingly enough, a number of industry players think blockchain itself could provide the answers. They range from the big, such as the 10 major utility companies joining the Energy Web Foundation’s efforts to identify and roll out blockchain energy solutions, to the small, such as US startup LO3 Energy’s launch of a blockchain-enabled green energy microgrid in Brooklyn later this year. Similar to LO3 Energy’s offering is that of Australian company Power Ledger, which has developed a peer-to-peer energy trading model that works around utilities companies using blockchain in much the same way that bitcoin traders dance past the banks. Power Ledger’s managing director, David Martin, explains that households that generate excess rooftop solar have to sell it to the grid operator at a greatly reduced price. “Imagine you’re growing a whole lot of tomatoes, but you can’t trade them over the fence with the neighbour for their zucchinis – you’ve got to go to the supermarket to sell to them and buy from them,” he says. “That’s the situation in energy markets now – we want to change that.” What his company is trialling is a system that will enable people to hawk off their rooftop solar energy directly to other households at a higher price than they would get by selling to a utility company. By making rooftop solar even more economical and maximising use of the power it generates, Martin hopes blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer energy trading will help lower carbon emissions while raising energy capacity. His company completed a virtual trial in Western Australia in January, and has taken the lessons learned from that and applied them to a real-world trial in Auckland, New Zealand. That began in December and will gradually ramp up to a network of 500 customers live-trading green energy. But isn’t the blockchain process that underpins the whole system gobbling up most the power? Not so, says Martin. He claims the energy-consumption issue has been averted by adopting a vastly more efficient form of blockchain than that which is used by bitcoin. Whereas most blockchain relies on proof-of-work processes, Power Ledger employs something called proof-of-stake. The former consumes vast amounts of energy as it involves solving ever-more complicated mathematical equations, but proof-of-stake blockchains are based on pseudo-random chance. “It uses the fraction of energy of conventional blockchain. Proof-of-stake is ideally suited for energy,” Martin says. One of the leading critics of blockchain’s energy-consumption backs the approach. Michel Berne, the director of economics studies at Telecom management school in Paris, has been highly critical of the carbon footprint of blockchain, but he thinks, for energy markets at least, proof-of-stake could be a solution. “Yes, I believe that proof-of-stake blockchain applications can validly compete with other non-blockchain based solutions in energy trading,” he says. “Peer-to-peer energy trading is nascent, notoriously difficult to manage and blockchain solutions might be useful.” He questions whether proof-of-stake could completely phase out proof-of-work blockchain in other sectors however, as he is unconvinced it offers the same level of security that is the point of blockchain in the first place. Energy-efficiency isn’t the only obstacle in the path of a blockchain-based electricity network. Dutch peer-to-peer energy trading network PowerPeers runs its system using already-available infrastructure and smart meter data. Co-founder Michiel Ooms says the company is looking for ways to integrate blockchain, but has encountered several roadblocks. “The biggest challenge we see so far is the handling of privacy-sensitive data,” he says. “Using the blockchain brings more transparency, including on data exchanged. And although our whole vision is about making the energy market more transparent, sharing privacy-sensitive data (such as consumptions, locations, financial transactions) probably would not comply with the GDPR regulations that come into effect in the EU in 2018. Legislators therefore also have quite a bit of work to do if they want to enable everyone to participate in the future energy landscape.” In Australia, Power Ledger also predicts legislative changes will be needed to pave the way for blockchain, or any kind of peer-to-peer energy trading for that matter. “The system was designed at a time when regulators didn’t contemplate distribution and storage, let alone customers trading among themselves – everything is set up for a system of generating power a long way away from a centralised source,” Martin says. “Reform is needed to the requirement that consumers who have excess PV being required to sell to a retailer – we need to change the market so it understands consumers aren’t just consumers anymore – they are generators too.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/aug/13/sun-rain-room-review-tonkin-liu-home-for-all-seasons","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-13T07:00:07Z","webTitle":"Sun Rain Room review – a home for all seasons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/aug/13/sun-rain-room-review-tonkin-liu-home-for-all-seasons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/aug/13/sun-rain-room-review-tonkin-liu-home-for-all-seasons","fields":{"headline":"Sun Rain Room review – a home for all seasons","bodyText":"When it starts raining on the slate roof of the Grade II-listed, late Georgian north London house where the architects Anna Liu and Mike Tonkin have their home and office, it gathers in a black downpipe on the rear wall. This is normal. What happens next is not. Before it gets to the bottom, like a stunt plane exiting a death dive, the pipe turns, curves and then swoops into a more shallow descent, then goes up a bit, then down again, before terminating in a non-figurative gargoyle about two metres off the ground, from which the rainwater, after a delay while it gathers enough pressure to push itself through the elaborate pipage, then gushes. Which turns out to be only one move of several in an architectural rain dance. The gargoyle discharges into a long black steel trough that, if a switch is flicked, then overflows via concealed pipework in such a way that water starts rising through the joints between dark granite paving in a small courtyard. Should it be night-time, horizontal lasers can be switched on, which capture drops with illumination as they fall and bounce. If it’s day and the sun comes out, rippling light will reflect off the wet paviours, bouncing around surrounding surfaces of glass, mirror and whiteness. All this irrigation and solar energy eventually manifests itself as vigorous vegetation, a touch exotic and tropical, some of it growing out of the planted roof that partially encircles the court. The Sun Rain Room, as this work is accurately called, may be the architectural project with the most meteorology per square metre since Noah built the ark. The architects say they want it to be “a good place to be on a bad day”. Because of the doubling and dissolving of the reflective surfaces, it takes a while to realise how little usable space is actually added – just a big wall cupboard to house a barbecue, a potting shed and such like, an enclosed area big enough for a smallish dining table and another, sheltered but external, where you can also eat. Mostly, it’s a machine for enjoying the weather. There is also a room underneath, the bedroom of a basement flat, added late in the gestation of the project when it became clear that the mathematics of property prices in the London borough of Islington would more than repay the cost of construction. It is thus a (relatively modest) addition to the new basementism that elsewhere in the capital has seen swimming pools and vintage car collections put underground. But here the main object of the work – which has taken 12 years to complete since it was a gleam in Tonkin and Liu’s eye, and whose cost of £235,000 would be much greater if they hadn’t put a lot of their own time and ingenuity into the construction – is to allow the full enjoyment of a small London garden that somehow they hadn’t used much. Its style, superficially, is a sort of retro-futurism, the 21st century as seen from the 1960s and 70s, a bit Kubrick, a bit Woody Allen in Sleeper, white and swooshy, engaging but hard now to look at without the condescending thought that the future didn’t turn out quite like this. Tonkin Liu, who made their name with a series of singular private homes and makeovers of public spaces, are fond of this style, though they’re fluid enough not to be a one-look practice. There is a bit of it in a bridge they have proposed for Salford, and the interiors of a clifftop house in Dover. The Sun Rain Room is also more than this. Tonkin refers to his early years working for an architectural reclamation company in Bath, where he “learned so much about classical detailing”. While there is absolutely nothing neo-Georgian about their design, he says, it has picked up cues from the house it extends, taking, for example, twists and curves from the old stairs and banisters. The architects also say they’re re-enacting on a smaller scale the interaction between hard architecture and lush planting that you get in the composition of the town square their house faces, with a big garden in the middle. The curving ceiling around the edge of the courtyard is punctured by small, glass-domed holes that admit discs of light, like little suns. The holes are at the end of inverted lunar craters whose curved concentric contours are then picked out in fine relief. The repeating curved lines consciously echo the waves of reflection that play across them. They modulate light and shadow in a way somewhat like the subtle recessions and projections of Georgian glazing bars and panelling. The old house itself is mostly painted white, with mirrors inset at opportune moments – behind shelves, in cupboard doors – such that they dematerialise the walls and fold views of external greenery and weather into the interior. They help to set up a continuum of light, reflection and dissolving surfaces that, while it’s clear where the old stops and the new starts, runs from the square garden through the house to the back of the Sun Rain Room. It has required patience and effort to achieve – negotiating the legalities of small London sites with many neighbours, waiting for financial stars to align, managing the construction themselves to keep costs down, working with sympathetic subcontractors. Two leading engineers have made possible the project’s structurally ambitious ideas. One, Tim Macfarlane, assisted with an all-glass staircase that maximises the light reaching the basement and glows at night with light coming from below. Another, Rodrigues Associates, has helped achieve the exceptionally thin profile of the curving roof. Its plywood structure was assembled with the help of students from three London architecture schools. In the end, the hard construction and hard work serve intangibles and subtle substances such as light, atmosphere and nature, things that, as Tonkin and Liu say, “don’t cost anything”. A world is constructed of dissolution, floating, evanescence and inversion in which opposites combine. There are plants on the roof and water on the floor. The stairs are glass. It’s techno-natural and futuro-Georgian. With so many ideas in a small place it could all be too much. With so many devices and contraptions, there’s a risk they might not function as well as advertised. But one of the impressive things about the Sun Rain Room is the degree of thought given to things like proportion, lines of sight and the shade of materials to put behind water, such that its drops and ripples become visible. It works."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/feb/09/powershop-reveals-cash-for-renewable-projects-from-customers-who-paid-more","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T19:01:07Z","webTitle":"Powershop reveals cash for renewable projects from customers who paid more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/09/powershop-reveals-cash-for-renewable-projects-from-customers-who-paid-more","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/feb/09/powershop-reveals-cash-for-renewable-projects-from-customers-who-paid-more","fields":{"headline":"Powershop reveals cash for renewable projects from customers who paid more","bodyText":"Amid fresh attacks on renewable energy targets from the federal government and large energy retailer ERM Power, smaller electricity retailer Powershop has raised $100,000 from its customers to be given out as grants to 10 community-owned projects around the country. Three months ago Powershop launched the Your Community Energy initiative, where they gave customers the opportunity to pay higher rates, which it said would then be distributed to renewable energy projects that were community-owned. Powershop aimed to raise $20,000 by the end of 2016 but, as of February 2017, it had raised $100,000. One project – rooftop solar on the Centre for Education and Research in Environmental Strategies (Ceres) centre in Melbourne – has already received $10,000 from the initiative and used that to complete their 15 KW solar installation. A spokeswoman for Ceres, Judy Glick, said the installation would save the community group $2,000 each year and reduce their yearly emissions by almost 16 tonnes of CO2. “Ceres is on a mission to achieve zero emissions by 2025,” she said. Five other projects were also announced as recipients of a share of the money. They include a micro hydro station in Daylesford, Victoria, which is being organised by Hepburn Wind, the operators of the first community-owned windfarm in Australia. Also receiving funding is the Milparinka Centre (Victoria), Castlemaine Childcare Centre (Victoria), Moyola Lodge (Victoria), Mid Mountains Neighbourhood Centre (NSW) and Buckets Way Neighbourhood Centre (NSW). Powershop’s chief executive, Ed McManus, said he expected to raise $500,000 within 12 months and wanted to accelerate the growth of community-owned renewable energy. “The way energy is generated, how it travels to our homes and how we pay for it, is going to change dramatically in our lifetime,” McManus said. McManus aacknowledged the initiative was partly about “brand-positioning” for Powershop. But he said the company began as a 100% renewable energy generation company and then only became a retailer when it partnered with a community-owned windfarm. He said that meant the initiative was a natural move for the people behind Powershop. McManus said Powershop would need to hear from community energy projects in order to find recipients for the money they expect to raise in the coming months. The Victorian minister for energy, environment and climate change, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the fact customers had chosen to pay more for their electricity to fund community renewable energy showed people were behind renewable energy and wanted to support it. “We should be encouraging all providers to find more ways for them to do so,” she said. Powershop also recently launched a program called the Your Neighbourhood Solar Powerpack, where customers in Victoria could buy solar energy directly from their neighbours, allowing those with rooftop solar to get a higher feed-in tariff."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/jul/26/california-communities-lawsuit-exxon-shell-climate-change-carbon-majors-sea-level-rises","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-26T06:00:33Z","webTitle":"Exxon, Shell and other carbon producers sued for sea level rises  in California","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/26/california-communities-lawsuit-exxon-shell-climate-change-carbon-majors-sea-level-rises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/26/california-communities-lawsuit-exxon-shell-climate-change-carbon-majors-sea-level-rises","fields":{"headline":"Exxon, Shell and other carbon producers sued for sea level rises in California","bodyText":"Three Californian communities have launched legal action against some of the world’s biggest oil, gas and coal companies, seeking compensation for the current and future costs of adapting to sea level rises linked to climate change. San Mateo and Marin Counties, coastal communities in northern California, and Imperial Beach, a city in San Diego County, have filed complaints against 37 “carbon majors”, including Shell, Chevron, Statoil, Exxon and Total. They claim greenhouse gas emissions from the fossil fuel companies’ activities over the last 50 years have locked in substantial sea level rises, which will cause billions of dollars’ worth of damage to properties and businesses, as well as endangering lives. According to the complaint, the defendants “have known for nearly 50 years years that greenhouse gas pollution from their fossil fuel products has a significant impact on the Earth’s climate and sea levels”. Rather than working to reduce impacts, the complaint claims the companies engaged in a “co-ordinated, multi-front effort to conceal and deny their knowledge of these threats”. A spokeswoman for Shell said “we believe climate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-carbon choices for businesses and consumers, not by the courts.” A spokesman for Statoil said this lawsuit was not the first against the industry and that “previous cases have been dismissed as [providing energy while meeting climate commitments] is a political, not a judicial, issue”. Exxon and Chevron declined to comment specifically on the litigation. BP and Total did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Climate change litigation “This an unprecedented moment for climate change litigation,” says Sophie Marjanac of campaigning lawyers Client Earth, which is monitoring the case. Coastal California is already experiencing the effects of rising sea levels, says Deborah Halberstadt, executive director of the state’s Ocean Protection Council which recently released a study (pdf) about the threat of rising seas. “The rate of ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets could rapidly accelerate, leading to extreme sea-level rise, [...] with potentially catastrophic impacts for California,” she says. Serge Dedina, the mayor of Imperial Beach, a low income coastal community in San Diego County, says that up to 30% of the city could be affected by climate change. “As the lowest-income, highest poverty-rate city in San Diego County, we have no capacity to pay for the extensive adaptation measures.” It’s a similar story for Marin County. Within 15 years, says county supervisor Kate Sears, flooding could affect tens of thousands of residents and cause upwards of $15.5bn (£11.9bn) in property damage. “This lawsuit is intended to shift those costs back where they belong – on the fossil fuel companies,” she says. “We are at the point of no return in fighting climate change,” says San Mateo supervisor Dave Pine, “and if we don’t reduce emissions there will be catastrophic impacts.” Potential property damage in the county is estimated to be in the region of $39bn, with sea level rises set to affect more than 100,000 residents (pdf). This isn’t the first time fossil fuel companies have found themselves facing legal action over climate change. Kivalina – an Alaskan barrier island community of fewer than 400 people – filed a lawsuit in 2008 against oil companies including BP and Chevron demanding up to $400m for relocating their village in the face of rising sea levels. They were ultimately unsuccessful, with their case dismissed on the basis that it was a political question, not one for the courts. “This claim has a better chance,” says Marjanac, “we have better climate science now.” She also believes the “vacuum in the US at a federal level” when it comes to climate change, may make the state court more willing to step in. She does, however, acknowledge there are significant hurdles to success. These include the “utility argument”: that companies are providing energy to the world, something that is demanded and sanctioned. Pressure heating up on carbon majors While all parties acknowledge the claim is likely to be prolonged, awareness raising is an important element. “This kind of litigation is a vital tool in the spreading effort to force oil companies to change their business models,” says Jeremy Leggett, founder of solar energy company Solarcentury. Exxon, Total, Shell and Statoil are among those already making some shifts away from fossil fuels. Shell’s CEO, Ben van Beurden, announced earlier this month that the company would invest up to $1bn per year in its New Energies division to explore alternative energy. But the energy transition will be “change that will take place over generations”, he said, not a revolution. Exxon told the Guardian “oil and natural gas will remain prominent in meeting global energy”, but a spokesman said the firm is working on alternatives and “invests about $1bn a year to support a broad portfolio of R&amp;D projects ranging from advanced biofuels to carbon capture.” Total has made significant investments including the purchase last year of battery company Saft for $1bn. And Statoil has established Statoil Energy Ventures with $200m in investment capital for four to seven years. However, many campaigners and analysts remain sceptical. “These investments amount to lip service,” says Kelly Mitchell, climate and energy director for Greenpeace USA, “while [fossil fuel companies] dump resources into more fossil fuel projects around the world, lobby politicians and lock us into decades of fossil-fuel infrastructure.” Leggett sees varying levels of seriousness among the big players. “No company has admitted the game is up yet. Some have taken out substantial hedged bets in the form of significant investments in clean energy, notably Total and Statoil. Others have dug in, seemingly for a fight to the death,” he says. “The bottom line,” says Mitchell, “is that these companies are clinging to an outdated business model that is not compatible with a safe climate and liveable communities.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/10/building-trust-into-greener-housing-north-west-cambridge-development","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"North West Cambridge: a model for affordable urban housing?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/10/building-trust-into-greener-housing-north-west-cambridge-development","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/10/building-trust-into-greener-housing-north-west-cambridge-development","fields":{"headline":"North West Cambridge: a model for affordable urban housing?","bodyText":"At the centre of debates about green belts is the question of trust. In theory it should be possible to build on a very small proportion of the nation’s green belts in such a way that affordable housing and sustainable communities are created, and more people have more and better access to nature than before. In practice few people trust that this will happen, as the available evidence is that we will get instead a smearing of developers’ standard products across the countryside, for sale at inflated prices. The promise of what’s called the North West Cambridge Development is that it will indeed achieve these good things. Here the University of Cambridge is turning 150 hectares of what was flat, inaccessible and somewhat featureless farmland, located between the city and the M11, into a billion-pound urban district the area of which is not much smaller than the historic centre of Cambridge itself. Three thousand homes are planned, half of them affordable, plus 2,000 postgraduate student bed spaces, 100,000 sq m of research facilities, and the schools, shops, surgeries and the like needed to sustain them. Two new public parks are being created, one between the new development and the old city, the other a series of lakes and mounds that buffer the sights and sounds of the motorway. The development is motivated by the extreme effects of growth in Cambridge, resulting in house values that have priced out key workers, including researchers and young academics, without which neither university nor city can function. In this way Cambridge acutely experiences pressures felt in other parts of the country, which has put it at the forefront of finding ways to do something about them. Change doesn’t happen quickly: discussions of expansion have been going on since the 1980s, with the current plans in development for over a decade. There is a patent desire to be responsible and exemplary in everything. The North West Cambridge Development sets out to achieve high levels of sustainability, including many photovoltaic cells to gather solar energy, low levels of car use and the recycling of rainwater for irrigation and the flushing of toilets. It has been masterminded by the multinational AECOM, which is one of the largest engineering and design consultancies in the world, with landscapes by Townshend, who have worked on large commercial developments such as King’s Cross in London. An array of well-respected architects have been brought in to design individual buildings: the Stirling prize winners Alison Brooks, Witherford Watson Mann, Wilkinson Eyre and Stanton Williams; Marks Barfield of London Eye fame, the Dutch practice Mecanoo and Muma, best known for their makeover of the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester. I am told that they also wanted “young” architects, although these practices are almost entirely led by over-50s. The plan is now taking physical form and, so far, it is doing what it said it would. The first homes have been completed in Eddington, which is the name given to the first phase. Residents have started moving in. A “market square” is complete. A new Sainsbury’s opened last week. A primary school has been open for two years. Swirles Court, housing for the graduate students of Girton College, is also complete. Unusually, in comparison with most commercial developments, it is the affordable housing and the shared facilities, rather then the more profitable high-value homes, that are being built first. Cambridge has never been a throbbing metropolis and its suburbs less so. By the time you get to the environs of north-west Cambridge the city is petering out into detached and semi-detached houses. Yet Eddington is in the form of apartment blocks, three to five storeys high, in density more like an inner suburb of a large Victorian city, with the intention of building a lot of homes without using up too much space. It’s a surprising typology, but it makes sense. The architectural style is bricky, rectangular, austere with a few outbreaks of playfulness. Ludwig Wittgenstein, who spent his last months in nearby Storey’s Way, once praised the plain Georgian terraces of Dublin for having “the good taste to know that they had nothing very important to say”, and the same might be said of this style. Metropolitan types call it the “new London vernacular”, but it turns out it’s at home here too, on the edge of the fens. Its best qualities are its thoughtfulness – the unusually high ceilings in ground-floor flats, the proportions of windows, the use of galleries with expansive views to give access to upper-level flats. The more public buildings loosen up a bit, though not too much. The school, by Marks Barfield, is an elegant flat doughnut with a calm, protected space in the centre. Muma’s nearly complete nursery school and community centre, designed for things like “dance classes or zumba, Brownies or film clubs, fashion shows, weddings or fairs”, will offer a lively inner world of contrasting volumes, while still being quite quiet on the outside. So the overall effect is of a development that is thoughtful and considered but also, even after making due allowance for its unfinished state and the fact that plants need to grow, overdoing its sobriety. Here the landscaping, which should be crucial, is unfortunately the weakest part. It should soften and animate and make places distinctive and sociable. What’s there, all good quality to be sure, has its moments – there’s a nice grassy swale running through the development that’s part of the rainwater system – but it tends towards the generic. The market square (where, for now, no actual markets are planned) is a could-be-anywhere bit of tasteful corporate design, for which some funky benches are not a sufficient antidote. There’s a long straight pedestrian-friendly street that looks promising as a place to congregate, but its hard and rectangular planters are oddly discouraging. The beige Mondrians of paving too often beat the planting. You can’t yet see spaces in which it would be a positive delight for children to play. More fundamentally the distribution of design intelligence is out of whack. In a way that almost always happens in projects of this scale the big efficient companies like AECOM are asked to make the really big decisions, whereas the Stirling prize winners and “young” architects get to play with a fairly limited range of choices about proportion and disposition. If the imagination and skills of the latter had been applied to the orchestration of a potentially rich array of shared spaces, and to an overall idea of the kind of place that is being created, it would have turned North West Cambridge from a good to a world-beating piece of planning. But these weaknesses should not detract from what is likely to be a fundamental success of the development. To the basic question to be asked when building on green belt or any green land – is it better than it would have been had it stayed as fields? – the answer is yes. More people will enjoy richer forms of nature in the new parks than in the past, and many will find homes at high levels of design and sustainability. The clout, wealth and wisdom of the university has been vital in achieving this, but if the model can be followed in other green locations across the country we might find a way to create large numbers of decent homes and respect nature at the same time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jun/01/trump-paris-climate-deal-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-01T20:28:18Z","webTitle":"Trump just passed on the best deal the planet has ever seen | David Suzuki","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/01/trump-paris-climate-deal-planet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/01/trump-paris-climate-deal-planet","fields":{"headline":"Trump just passed on the best deal the planet has ever seen","bodyText":"Since day one as a contender for the Oval Office, current US President Donald Trump has pushed a dominant narrative: he’s a businessman. He gets economics. He knows the art of the deal. This week, with his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement, the president has given the world strong reason to reject that narrative. His rationale – that it’s a choice of economy over environment, and a fossil fuel economy is the top priority – is outdated and false. States and nations around the world have harvested the fruits of clean energy, and are redefining their economies and energy sources accordingly. Yet under false pretenses that “clean coal”, natural gas and other fossil fuel fixes are better than energy conservation and clean energy, the US forges its own, lonely path. The idea that clean, renewable energy will generate power for our planet for generations to come is not rhetoric. The extent of human-caused climate change – and the rapidly improving economics driving the proliferation of renewable energy sources – make it fact. If the US administration isn’t ready to move forward, hundreds of individual states and other countries will. California is already a world leader on climate policy. Texas is rapidly expanding its wind energy capacity. In Germany, clean energy has become a movement itself, focused on thousands of small-scale projects under the Energiewende program. In Scotland, wind generation has increased by 81% over the past year, and in March this year, it produced enough energy to satisfy 136 % of the country’s household energy needs. These are just a few examples. The US’s withdrawal doesn’t mean Americans and US investors will sit still, either. There is substantial economic opportunity in renewables. The US solar industry alone creates one in 50 new jobs. Worldwide, nearly 10 million people already work in renewable energy. Global clean technology exports doubled between 2008 and 2015, surpassing $1.15tn per year. Even America’s corporate giants – from Apple and Google to Walmart, and even oil giant Exxon Mobil – support the Paris agreement. The economics are clear. So what about the political implications of the decision? By withdrawing from this historical agreement, Trump will make more enemies than friends. Polling results from Yale University’s Climate Change in the American Mind survey (conducted after the US election) show that 73% of Trump voters want the US to use more renewable energy. (His own supporters!) As recently as May 7, a small but increasingly vocal group of Republicans has embraced the reality of global warming, taking steps to press the issue in Congress. Elsewhere in the world, 195 countries and the European Union have signed the Paris Agreement, 147 of which have ratified it. Only Nicaragua and Syria have not signed on. When news of the potential withdrawal reached the United Nations, the organization’s Twitter page read: “Climate change is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable. Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable.” A Globe and Mail report showed that even fossil fuel companies – the likes of ExxonMobil, BP and Shell – think the US should stick with Paris. This withdrawal is an ugly decision, made by a country that ought to be leading the transition to a cleaner future – not only because of its stature as an international economic powerhouse, but also because of its less-than-desirable environmental track record. After China, the US is the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas polluter. In response, China has been become a leading producer of solar energy technology and is slowing its coal power construction. The US, meanwhile, hangs on to a coal industry that should have been dissolved decades ago. Just north of the border in Canada, where I live, the situation is delicate. We have been plagued by recent missteps such as approval of fossil-fuel-driven pipeline projects, but at least our governments claim a commitment to a sustainable, clean energy future. In my home province of British Columbia, recent election results may even reverse the approval of some of those infrastructure projects. But we’re far from safe ground. These types of actions by the US administration show that environmental rights – for Canada and all countries around the world – are vital, now more than ever. Yet, while 110 countries worldwide have environmental rights written into their constitutions, Canada does not. I tend to focus my advice on domestic matters like these. But today, I offer a word to the US president: A global shift to renewable energy is on. There’s no denying it or turning it around. It’s good for business. This is not fake news. It’s real life. And it’s happening with or without you. You claim you know a good deal when you see one. Well, you just passed on one of the best our planet has ever seen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/jun/29/apple-patagonia-solar-panel-sell-electricity-profit","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-29T19:38:40Z","webTitle":"What do Apple and Patagonia have in common?

Making money from solar","bodyText":"What does it mean when the solar panels on your roof were purchased by a clothing company? Maybe that you are part of a significant shift in the economics of solar. Patagonia and a small circle of US companies are making a foray into the electricity delivery service industry, which has traditionally been controlled by utilities and power plant owners. Most businesses that put solar panels on their roofs in order to show support for a cleaner source of electricity, cut carbon emissions and perhaps even lower their energy bills. But these new entrants are treating solar energy as a profit maker, and their investments will help to expand its use in the broader energy market. Patagonia, the outdoor clothing retailer, announced in March a $35m partnership to install solar panels on more than 1,500 homes in the US. Long known for its focus on environmental issues and having solar panels at its headquarters in southern California, Patagonia will own the solar energy systems. It has contracted with California-based Sungevity to install and manage the panels and handle customer service. Most of the solar energy generated by the Patagonia systems will power the participating homes. The company and Sungevity earn a small profit on that as well as on the sale of any surplus energy sent to the grid. “As a company, it very much aligns with the DNA of what we do, and that’s [to] use business to inspire and influence environmental solutions,” says Phil Graves, director of corporate development at Patagonia. “We’re very passionate about moving away from fossil fuels and finite resources in every aspect of our supply chain.” The new venture isn’t the company’s first investment in solar. In 2014, Patagonia set up a $27m fund to install solar on 1,000 rooftops in Hawaii, which depends on imported petroleum fuels to run its electricity-generating plants. The company saw the project as an opportunity to help swing the state toward a carbon-free alternative. Graves declined to reveal Patagonia’s earnings on solar so far, except to say it has been “good” for the company. “Let’s just call it a double-digit return,” he says. Patagonia isn’t alone in branching out from its core business. The company that started the trend is Google, which received a federal license to sell energy in 2010. The company has since invested hundreds of millions of dollars in solar energy ventures, from rooftop projects to massive power plants within the US and in Germany and South Africa, as part of a plan to use more renewable energy and profit from these investments. Apple seems to share the same interest. Earlier this month, the company applied for a federal license to sell any excess electricity from the solar panels that will grace the roofs of its future headquarters and other existing buildings around the country. In recent years, Apple has been building giant solar power plants near its data centers and offices in North Carolina, Nevada and California. Electricity from these projects will flow into local electric grids and offset the fossil fuel-generated electricity Apple draws from the same grids. The falling cost of solar and implementation of government incentives have made it attractive as an alternative – and cleaner – source of electricity to businesses. Walmart, Costco, Kohl’s, Ikea and Macy’s are the top solar customers as measured by the megawatts installed, according to GTM Research. The Top 20 list also includes manufacturers such as Johnson &amp; Johnson and General Motors and publisher McGraw-Hill. GTM Research predicts the megawatts of commercial solar will grow 30% this year and nearly triple by 2020, reaching $3.8bn. Lining up business customers takes more time and energy than residential customers, however. The solar market that serves commercial customers has been flat in recent years, partly because every commercial project starts with a blank sheet of paper: customers each have unique power demands and installation issues, and expect their own contractual terms, says Justin Baca, vice president of markets and research at the Solar Energy Industries Association. In residential, on the other hand, every customer signs the same contract and usually gets very similar equipment. That simpler process makes the residential market more appealing to companies that are interested in earning a profit from solar. But the industry is filled with competitors, from big players such as SolarCity and Sunrun to local roofers and contractors who have experience installing electrical equipment. Patagonia’s entry brings new money to the space and helps to promote solar energy use among homeowners. “If they found a way to do small deals economically, that would be interesting because it could greatly increase the available capital pool,” Baca says. Patagonia’s interest in solar began with a personal connection. The company’s CEO, Rose Marcario, is a friend of Timothy Ball, the co-founder and former chairman of Mainstream Energy, a solar company in California. Ball urged Marcario to consider investing in the clean energy. A generous federal tax credit certainly helps to nudge the clothing company – and other businesses – to consider solar as a financially viable option. The tax law allows Patagonia to own the energy systems and claim 30% of their costs as an income tax credit. In effect, the rules permit Patagonia to spend some of its federal taxes on solar energy systems. Patagonia has more plans. One idea is to install mini solar power plants to serve up energy to nearby communities, where residents can buy a stake in those projects or sign a long-term contract to pay for solar electricity. Such larger-scale projects, called community solar, are a fairly new and growing area for the industry. They require millions of dollars in capital, and the permitting hurdles can be daunting for most companies. But according to GTM Research, community solar is expected to grow fivefold this year, a result of more states enacting legislation to permit such projects. It may be another area where Patagonia encourages other environmentally minded firms to paddle along in its wake. Graves has had several conversations with chief financial officers at other companies to walk them through the solar deal-making process. Some are beginning to line up their own partnerships. “It’s too preliminary to name names,” he says. “But several of them are companies you’ve heard of.” San Diego homeowner Gene Loucks is one of the first customers under the new Patagonia-funded program. His new solar panels went live earlier this month, and he expects them to help him save $150 per month on his power bill. Loucks doesn’t own the system, so he’s paying only for the electricity. That works out just fine because it also means he doesn’t have to maintain it. “It seems like a good deal for everybody,” says Loucks, 57, who works in law enforcement. “We’re in southern California, and there’s sun all year round here, so it’s really silly for somebody in San Diego to not take advantage of it. It’s just good for the planet.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"cities/2017/mar/18/real-estate-revolution-unstoppable-building-boom-china","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-18T08:00:33Z","webTitle":"Put us on the map, please: China's smaller cities go wild for starchitecture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/18/real-estate-revolution-unstoppable-building-boom-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/mar/18/real-estate-revolution-unstoppable-building-boom-china","fields":{"headline":"Put us on the map, please: China's smaller cities go wild for starchitecture","bodyText":"From egg-shaped concert halls to skyscrapers reminiscent of big pairs of pants, China’s top cities are famously full of curious monuments to architectural ambition. But as land prices in the main metropolises have shot into the stratosphere, developers have been scrambling to buy up plots in the country’s second and third-tier cities, spawning a new generation of delirious plans in the provinces. President Xi Jinping may have issued a directive last year outlawing “oversized, xenocentric, weird” buildings, but many of these schemes were already well under way; his diktat has proved to be no obstacle to mayoral hubris yet. From Harbin “City of Music” to Dezhou “Solar Valley”, provincial capitals are branding themselves as themed enclaves of culture and industry to attract inward investment, and commissioning scores of bold buildings to match. Even where there is no demand, city bureaucrats are relentlessly selling off land for development, hawking plots as the primary form of income – accounting for 80% of municipal revenues in some cases. In the last two months alone, 50 Chinese cities received a total of 453bn yuan (£54bn) from land auctions , a 73% increase on last year, and it’s the provincial capitals that are leading the way. At the same time, Xi’s national culture drive has seen countless museums, concert halls and opera houses spring up across the country, often used as sweeteners for land deals, conceived as the jewels at the centre of glistening mixed-used visions (that sometimes never arrive). “Culture,” said Xi, “is the prerequisite of the great renaissance of the Chinese people,” but it has also proved to be a powerful lubricant for ever more real estate speculation – even if the production of content to fill these great halls can’t quite keep up with the insatiable building boom. From mountain-shaped apartment blocks to cavernous libraries, here’s a glimpse of what’s emerging in the regions. Fake Hills, Beihai Forming an 800 metre-long cliff-face along the coast of the southern port city of Beihai, the Fake Hills housing block is the work of Ma Yansong, China’s homegrown conjuror of sinuous, globular forms – whose practice is appropriately named MAD. Having studied at Yale and worked with Zaha Hadid in London, where he nourished his penchant for blobs, Ma has spent the last decade dreaming up improbable mountain-shaped megastructures across the country. As it rises and falls, the undulating roofline of Fake Hills forms terraces for badminton and tennis courts, as well as a garden and swimming pool. Sadly the overall effect is less scenic mountain range than a lumpen collision of colossal cruise-liners. Greenland Tower, Chengdu A crystalline spire rising 468 metres above the 18 million-strong metropolis of Chengdu, the Greenland Tower will be the tallest building in southwestern China, standing as a sharply chiselled monument to the country’s (and by some counts the world’s) largest property developer, Greenland Holdings. It is designed by Chicago-based Adrian Smith and Gordon Gill, architects of Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, who say the faceted shaft is a reference to the “unique ice mountain topography” of the region. It harks back to the crystalline dreams of early 20th-century German architect Bruno Taut, who imagined a dazzling glass “city crown” to celebrate socialism and agriculture; whether Sichuan’s farmers will be welcomed into the penthouse sky garden remains to be seen. Sun-Moon mansion, Dezhou Once known as a centre of braised chicken production, the city of Dezhou in the north-eastern province of Shandong now brands itself as “Solar Valley”, a renewable energy centre intended to rival California’s Silicon Valley. At its heart is the Sun-Moon mansion, a vast fan-shaped office building powered by an arc of solar panels on its roof. It is the brainchild of Huang Ming, aka China’s “sun king”, an oil industry engineer turned solar energy tycoon who heads the Himin Solar Energy Group, the world’s biggest producer of solar water heaters – as well as purveyor of sun-warmed toilet seats and solar-powered Tibetan prayer wheels. Harbin Opera House Nicknamed the St Petersburg of the east, the far northern city of Harbin has long had a thriving cultural scene as a gateway to Russia and beyond. In the 1920s, fashions from Paris and Moscow arrived here before they reached Shanghai, and it was home to the country’s first symphony orchestra, made up of mostly Russian musicians. Declared “city of music” in 2010, Harbin has recently pumped millions into a gleaming new concert hall by Arata Isozaki, a gargantuan neo-classical conservatory and an 80,000 sq metre whipped meringue of an opera house by MAD. Shaped like a pair of snowy dunes, up which visitors can climb on snaking paths, the building contains a sinuous timber-lined auditorium designed as an eroded block of wood. Tianjin Binhai library Due to open this summer in the sprawling port city of Tianjin, this space-age library by Dutch architects MVRDV is imagined as a gaping cave of books, carved out from within an oblong glass block. The shelves form a terraced landscape of seating, wrapping around a giant mirrored sphere auditorium that nestles in the middle of the space like a pearl in an oyster. Along with a new theatre, congress centre and a science and technology museum by Bernard Tschumi, the building forms part of a new cultural quarter for the city, itself being swallowed into the planned Beijing-Tianjin mega-region – population 130 million, that’s more than Japan. Huaguoyuan Towers, Guiyang Nowhere in China is the disparity between economic reality and architectural ambition more stark than in Guiyang, capital of rural Guizhou, the poorest province in the country, which has the fifth most skyscraper plans of any Chinese city. The twin 335-metre towers of the Huaguoyuan development, by Arup, are now almost complete, standing as the centrepiece of a new mixed-use office, retail and entertainment complex, while SOM is busy conjuring the even higher Cultural Plaza Tower, a 521-metre glass spear that will soar above a new riverfront world of shopping malls and theatres. It has the glitz and gloss of any other Chinese city’s new central business district, but as Knight Frank’s David Ji points out: “It will be hard for a city like Guiyang to find quality tenants to fill the space.” Yubei agricultural park, Chongqing Architectural funster Will Alsop may finally have found his calling in the supercharged furnace of China’s second-tier cities’ booming leisure economy, crafting a number of fantastical dreamworlds from his new satellite studio in Chongqing – where he is busy building a new cultural quarter around his own office, with a restaurant, bar and distillery. He is also plotting an enormous agricultural leisure park in Yubei, 20 miles north of the city, designed to cater to the new middle classes’ nascent appreciation of the countryside, a place hitherto associated with peasants and poverty. The rolling landscape will be dotted with cocoon-like treehouses, a flower-shaped hotel and a big lake covered by an LED-screen canopy, so visitors can enjoy projected blue skies despite the smog. Zendai Himalayas centre, Nanjing Erupting across six city blocks like a limestone mountain range, the Zendai Himalayas Centre will be Ma’s most literal interpretation yet of his philosophy of fusing architecture and nature. Taking inspiration from the traditional style of “shanshui” landscape brush painting (literally meaning “mountain-water”), the 560,000 sq metre complex is designed to look as if it has been eroded by millennia of wind and water, not thrown up overnight by an army of migrant labourers. Once again, Ma appears to be forgetting that elegant feathery brushstrokes don’t often translate well into lumps of glass and steel. It is one of many such green-fingered schemes in Nanjing, including Stefano Boeri’s “vertical forest” towers and the Sifang art park, where Steven Holl, SANAA, David Adjaye and others have built pavilions in a rolling landscape – as another decoy for a luxury real estate project. Huawei campus, Dongguan Telecoms giant Huawei has courted lawsuits for copying from rivals in the past, but its love of imitating clearly extends to architecture too. The company’s new campus, under construction on a 300-acre site in Dongguan, is based on 12 European towns. There are the dreaming spires of Oxford, the quaint redbrick houses of Bruges, the palazzos of Verona and the chateaux of Burgundy, all connected by a meandering Swiss railway. It might look like a theme park, but the employees will have little time for leisure: Huawei’s founder likens his staff to a pack of hungry wolves and offers them a “dedicated employee agreement” to voluntarily forgo paid holiday and overtime.

While this is a blow for the fight against climate change, recent history suggests that a new “G3” – the EU, China and India – can fill the vacuum in leadership, plus the private sector in the US is already committed to renewable energy. There are three reasons to be hopeful: 1) US private sector and finance still support renewables The US is a leading source of renewable energy technology and finance, and is at the forefront of research around emerging frontiers such as energy storage. It has pledged the largest amount to the Green Climate Fund ($3bn) of which $1bn has already been disbursed. The rest of the contribution is now threatened, which could be an impediment to technology transfer to the developing world. However the American private sector is likely to step up in its quest to reach global markets and push towards price competitiveness as well. Signals from industry support this – General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt recently tweeted: “Industry must now lead and not depend on government.” On the financing side, the increasing value of renewables may mitigate the effect of any reductions to the Green Climate Fund. For example, 2016 saw deals in many countries where the cost of solar energy was well below the cost of power from coal. 2) The US is no longer leading the way There have been worries that the US exit from the Paris Agreement will trigger others to do the same. This is unlikely as narratives have shifted away from this being a zero-sum game, towards being a goal that is worth acting upon in national interest. A move away from fossil fuels used to imply losing global competitiveness, but now the prices of renewable energy now suggest otherwise. Europe and the global south, including rising powers India and China remain vocally committed to the Paris Agreement, fighting climate change and adopting renewable energy. The boom in renewable energy investments in India, China, Japan, US and EU countries have led renewable prices to plummet; this is unlikely to abate. We believe that all is not lost – the stars are aligning towards a new triumvirate, consisting of India, China and the EU, that can lead the fight against climate change. Each will bring a unique but complementary set of leadership qualities. 3) The new global leaders are making progress The EU is showing strong leadership on climate change. Several European countries have developed renewable-friendly policies; almost 90% of new capacity in Europe in 2016 came from renewables. A strong private sector has been expanding globally as well. Statements made by the leadership – such as the EU/China joint statement, and Italy, France and Germany’s refusal to renegotiate Paris – are positive signs. The combined EU pledge to the Green Climate Fund, at $4.8bn, is significant; however, financing flows towards the global south will have to increase, through the development finance or private investment. We don’t know whether that will happen, although the EU is showing signs of a more assertive foreign policy (in response to Brexit, a withdrawing America, and a more assertive Russia) and the architects of a new EU consensus on development are promising to step into the leadership gap left by the US. China has articulated its desire to lead, and has backed it up with domestic actions. While meeting domestic targets will support the Paris Agreement’s agenda, it could step into more of a global leadership role by extending its expertise and financial support for infrastructure in developing countries. This can be done by including it as a core component to its various bilateral project development initiatives (such as in Africa), as well as by leveraging multilateral institutions such as the New Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. For India, a knowledge-rich and resource-lite approach may be the most feasible due to financial constraints. It has been aggressively building renewable capacity, and could well exceed Paris targets – the draft National Electricity Plan projects that 57% of electricity capacity will come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2027, compared to the Paris target of 40% by 2030. This plan projects that no new coal-based power will be required; the recent cancellation of coal-based power projects back this up. India has also pushed for a commercially sound policy framework, exemplified by its auction system. Though not without flaws, India’s experiences are invaluable and can be shared with other developing countries through research and development, capacity building, technical assistance and project development via experienced Indian firms. One promising route is through the International Solar Alliance (hosted by India), which will seek to promote innovative policies, demonstration projects, and capacity building measures, as well as leverage financial instruments to mobilise over $1tn investments by 2030. While the American exit has been a setback for the global fight against climate change, India, China and EU should view this as an opportunity to lead. This will not, by itself, close the gap to achieve the two degrees Celsius goal, but it could flip the narrative and propel a virtuous cycle of action by others. Supported by a sound commercial argument, now is the time for the new G3 to demonstrate climate leadership. Kabir Nanda is a senior consultant and Varad Pande is a partner at Dalberg.

Here is what we can expect him to say, who we can expect to be in attendance and who will say what in response. Economy He may or may not be statesmanlike but Trump will definitely be salesmanlike. Working on the premise that the chief business of the American people is business, he will make the case that he, the first businessman president, has brought the economy “roaring” back to life and set the stock market soaring. A tweet last Sunday offered a flavour: “Our economy is better than it has been in many decades. Businesses are coming back to America like never before. Chrysler, as an example, is leaving Mexico and coming back to the USA. Unemployment is nearing record lows. We are on the right track!” Anxious to reach beyond his base with an eye on November’s midterm elections, Trump is likely to note that the African American unemployment rate has fallen to a record low of 6.8%. Critics, however, will be quick to counter-claim that whereas 2.06m jobs were created in 2017, about 2.24m jobs were created under Barack Obama in 2016; that Trump’s sweeping tax cut benefits millionaires and big corporations rather than the middle class; and that the administration is carrying out a savage assault on labour rights. Infrastructure In his address to a joint session of Congress on 27 February last year, Trump announced that he would be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1tn investment in infrastructure. “Crumbling infrastructure,” he said, “will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.” But in June, a so-called national infrastructure week was overshadowed by several mishaps and the fired FBI director James Comey’s testimony on Capitol Hill. The plan will feature again heavily in the State of the Union address, but details are not expected to be unveiled until mid-February. Infrastructure is seen as having potential for bipartisan support, but the administration is now planning to spend $200bn over the next 10 years, hoping states, cities and private investors will deliver the lion’s share of $1tn or even $1.7tn. The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, told a Washington Post event on Monday: “The president has always talked about infrastructure, but it’s also, just as with immigration, been a moving kind of target.” Democrats are also worried about Trump slashing environmental regulations to make way for construction. Immigration Trump said on Monday he would address his proposed immigration overhaul in the speech – and it would have to be bipartisan “because the Republicans don’t really have the votes to get it done in any other way”. In the State of the Union he will promote “four pillars” of reform: border security, including the wall; Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) legalisation; ending extended-family “chain migration”; eliminating the visa lottery and moving towards a merit-based system of immigration. Tone and nuance will matter here as the president tries to sell a deal to both Democrats and immigration hardliners in his own party: save the Dreamers but pay the price of a draconian crackdown on immigration, both legal and illegal. The signs so far are that neither side is happy. Meanwhile Trump has called for changes to the H-1B work visa programme widely used to employ foreign tech workers in the US and could return to this issue. National security A senior administration official said: “The president is going to talk about rebuilding our military, returning to a policy of peace through strength, returning to clarity about our friends and our adversaries, and his efforts to defeat terrorists around the world.” Trump is likely to declare total victory over Islamic State and claim that his aggressive stance towards North Korea’s nuclear programme is working: it is unknowable whether he will be tempted to stray into rhetoric such as “Little Rocket Man” to describe Kim Jong-un. American forces in Afghanistan currently number around 14,000 – a 75% increase from the 8,400 there under Barack Obama as of December 2016. The president is expected to ask for $716bn in defence spending, a significant increase, when he unveils his 2019 budget next month, according to the Washington Post. But diplomacy, the state department and human rights are not expected to figure prominently. Trade Trump said on Monday his speech would cover his efforts to lower trade barriers around the world for American exports. “We have to have reciprocal trade,” he told reporters. “It’s not a one-way deal any more.” Within days of moving into the Oval Office, Trump pulled the US out of the 11-country Trans-Pacific Partnership. He is renegotiating Nafta, a decades-old agreement with Canada and Mexico, as well as a separate, bilateral trade pact with South Korea. Last week the president imposed steep tariffs on imports of washing machines and solar energy cells and panels. Some hardliners in the administration are itching to do likewise to steel and aluminum from China as part of their “America first” agenda. But it is thought that the National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have restrained this tendency, appealing to Trump by warning that such a move could hurt his cherished stock market. The address may offer a clue as to whether Trump’s exposure to the global business elites in Davos has softened his approach or at least introduced a note of pragmatism. Any other business Last February Trump urged Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act: it was a long and tortuous process that ended in failure. The burning health issue is opioids, the deadliest drug crisis in American history, killing about 90 people every day. Trump has set up a presidential taskforce and declared a health emergency but not yet unlocked additional funding. The speech’s appeal to patriotism and greatness may well including rumination on Nasa, space exploration and a mooted return to the moon. But a detailed plan for combating climate change seems unlikely from a man who last week told the interviewer Piers Morgan: “There is a cooling and there is a heating, and I mean, look: it used to not be climate change. It used to be global warming … That wasn’t working too well, because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they’re setting records, OK, they’re at a record level.” Mood music After Trump honoured the widow of a navy Seal killed in Yemen during his address to a joint session of Congress, the political commentator Van Jones memorably declared: “He became president of the United States in that moment, period.” How long will it be on Tuesday night before a pundit uses the word “presidential”? Even if Trump stays on script, as he did last February and last week in Davos, critics say that merely showing the ability to read from a teleprompter is setting the bar too low and risks normalising a dangerous demagogue. For sheer theatre, it will be difficult to top Trump – accused of sexual misconduct by 19 women – being confronted by the sight of many female Democratic members of Congress following the lead of entertainers at this year’s Golden Globe awards by wearing black. Meanwhile, at least eight Democrats are boycotting the event: Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, John Lewis of Georgia, Frederica Wilson of Florida, Gregory Meeks of New York, Maxine Waters of California and Bobby Rush and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois. The supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will also be missing. Such is Trump’s caprice that there is always the chance that he will be goaded into an outburst that upends the entire event, or that he will undermine his message with an undisciplined tweet soon after (he followed his congressional address by tweeting the unfounded claim that Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower). Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for George W Bush, told the Associated Press: “He has little message discipline. Virtually every time he moves the ball far down the field, he seems to derail himself with a tweet days later instead of building on the momentum.” Guests The White House says Melania Trump, who has kept a low profile since reports emerged that her husband had an affair with the pornographic actor Stormy Daniels a decade ago, will be in attendance, along with all the president’s children except his 11-year-old son, Barron. The administration has also invited guests including Corey Adams, a welder in Dayton, Ohio who plans to invest his extra savings from the tax overhaul plan into his daughters’ education fund; Elizabeth Alvarado and Robert Mickens, the parents of Nisa Mickens, whose killing in 2016 was attributed to the MS-13 gang; the retired corporal Matthew Bradford, who stepped on a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2007 then after surgery re-enlisted in the Marine Corps and became the first blind double amputee to do so; Jon Bridgers, founder of the Cajun Navy, a nonprofit rescue and recovery group that provided aid to people in Texas affected by Hurricane Harvey; and Ryan Holets, a policeman in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who with his wife adopted a baby from parents who had an opioid addiction. Democrats have invited victims of sexual assault and dozens of young immigrants, or “Dreamers”, including an aspiring nurse, Karen Bahena, of San Diego, and a Virginia high school student, Nicolle Uria, who was brought to the US as a one-year-old. Also expected are Randy Bryce, a union iron worker and Democratic challenger to the House speaker, Paul Ryan, in his congressional district in southern Wisconsin (invited by the congressman Mark Pocan); Staff Sgt Patricia King, a transgender infantry soldier (invited by the congressman Joe Kennedy III); Yulín Cruz, mayor of San Juan in hurricane-hit Puerto Rico and critic of Trump (invited by the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand); Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian-born physician who discovered chronic traumatic encephalopathy in American football players (invited by the congressman Ami Bera); Christine Levinson, the wife of the FBI agent Bob Levinson, who went missing in Iran more than a decade ago (invited by the congressman Ted Deutch); and Bill Nye the Science Guy (invited by congressman Jim Bridenstine, Trump’s nominee to serve as the next administrator of Nasa). Responses Joe Kennedy III, a 37-year-old Massachusetts congressman who is a grandson of former senator and attorney general Robert F Kennedy and great-nephew of John F Kennedy, will deliver the Democratic response from a vocational high school in Fall River, Massachusetts, a former textile hub outside Boston. “From healthcare to economic justice to civil rights, the Democratic agenda stands in powerful contrast to President Trump’s broken promises to American families,” Kennedy said this week. His speech will be followed by a Spanish-language response delivered by Elizabeth Guzman, one of the first Latina women elected to the Virginia house of delegates. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, the congresswoman Maxine Waters of California, and the former Maryland congresswoman Donna Edwards will also offer their takes. Souvenirs Tickets for the address had to be reissued after a misprint: “Address to the Congress on the State of the Uniom.” The congressman Raul Grijalva of Arizona made fun of the education secretary, tweeting: “Just received my ticket for the State of the Union. Looks like @BetsyDeVosEd was in charge of spell checking ... #SOTUniom” Any ticket to Trump’s first State of the Union could become a collector’s item. The late-night TV comedian Stephen Colbert said on Monday: “He’s not scheduled to appear in front of Congress again until the impeachment hearings.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/mar/15/environmental-and-economic-impact-of-british-energy-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-15T19:01:22Z","webTitle":"Environmental and economic impact of British energy policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/environmental-and-economic-impact-of-british-energy-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/mar/15/environmental-and-economic-impact-of-british-energy-policy","fields":{"headline":"Environmental and economic impact of British energy policy","bodyText":"In December, David Cameron joined 195 other leaders to promise ambitious action on climate change. Achieving the Paris goals requires leaving most of the world’s fossil fuel reserves in the ground. A first step must be to stop subsidising fossil fuel production. Wednesday’s budget is an acid test of the government’s Paris commitment. In last year’s budget, the chancellor gave £1.3bn in new tax breaks and direct funding to the oil industry. The UK Treasury receives a smaller share of oil revenues than most other comparable countries. Meanwhile, the government has exempted a whole new fossil-fuel industry – fracking – from half of its tax, despite huge local opposition wherever it is proposed. The government has slashed support for wind and solar energy, costing thousands of jobs. Yet its free-market rationale does not apply when it comes to the oil and gas industry, which has received continued government support even in times of super-normal profits. The chancellor has to change course. He should scrap subsidies that keep the British economy hooked on fossil fuels, and instead set out a strategy to help communities currently dependent on fossil fuel jobs to diversify and to rebuild around world-leading clean technology. Craig Bennett CEO, Friends of the Earth, England, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland Marc Stears Chief executive, New Economics Foundation Elizabeth Bast Acting executive director, Oil Change International Peter Wooders Programme leader, Global Subsidies Initiative, International Institute for Sustainable Development Mika Minio-Paluello Coordinator, Platform • In your article on the alarming rise in global temperatures, you quote Professor Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, who said that “we are in a kind of climate emergency now” (February global temperature ‘shockingly’ high, say scientists, 15 March). He is, of course, correct, and so we urgently need to implement an effective response. The obvious way to do this would be to cut global greenhouse emissions now, but electorates are still utterly unwilling to accept the radical lifestyle changes we need to achieve this. No western government would dare double petrol prices or remove our ability to repeatedly fly abroad for holidays. No developing-country leaders are going to tell their people they can never have a western lifestyle. The only politically feasible solutions are technological ones, such as carbon scrubbing and geoengineering. Therefore, David Cameron and other world leaders need to start making a massive investment in those areas now, possibly funded by an international financial transactions tax. Otherwise, we do face disaster. Richard Mountford Tonbridge, Kent • The chief executive of the Road Haulage Association (Budget 2016: Osborne to cut an extra £4bn, 14 March) is guilty of some very selective arithmetic. If an RPI increase in fuel duty represents an increase of £450 per truck per year, then the 40p drop in fuel prices we have enjoyed over the last few years represents a decrease of £24,000 per truck. I wonder how many hauliers have reduced their prices to reflect this. The low fuel prices are a heaven-sent opportunity for the chancellor to raise some serious revenue. If the RPI 0.75p rise would bring in £345.5m, then a 20p rise could raise over £9bn with motorists and hauliers still better off than when prices reached their peak. That would save a great deal of pain elsewhere in the economy. Keith Potter Gunnislake, Cornwall • The proposed CMA reforms in the gas and electricity distribution sector are a grave disappointment (Report, 11 March); its intention to “enable competition to grow further” may be misguided. We don’t need another layer of expensive administration the costs of which will inevitably be passed on to consumers. And it will take too long to implement. Since nationalisation, this industry has lost its moral compass and become more concerned with maximising shareholder profit than providing a minimal cost reliable service. The intention of encouraging consumers to migrate to cheaper deals is admirable, but it is optimistic to believe that this will lead to lower overall costs rather than merely redistributing the same total billing charges over the same customers. Would it not have been simpler, easier and quicker to make each major supplier improve the lot of their own existing customers that have been on a standard variable tariff (SVT) for say more than two years by moving them on to that company’s best fixed one-year tariff? The suppliers could be mandated to make this move within six months and to maintain such customers on a similarly priced fixed tariff for at least four further years. The current practice of migrating customers at the termination of a fixed price period on to a SVT unless the customer makes an effort to stay on a better tariff should be banned. The default should be to move them to another reasonably priced term tariff. Iain Oldcorn Ascot, Berkshire • It has been said that the Hinkley Point imbroglio has led to a missed opportunity to install the equivalent capacity over the period up to 2024, probably at lower cost as with power actually becoming steadily available over the construction period (Hinkley Point is a costly mistake, but only France can pull the plug, 14 March). As it happens, the current cost per megawatt of providing wind and solar power is about the same as that for building Hinkley Point. But as the sale price for Hinkley Point output is inflation-proofed by the government up to 2092, wind and solar power are certain to continue coming down from today’s prices. It is of course true that wind and solar cannot be relied on for continuous electricity in all weather conditions. But nuclear power has consistently failed to function at the levels of baseload for which it has been designed. And that also requires back-up reserve plants, thus improving the relative performance of the alternative fuels. Wind and solar power consume fuel that is cost-free, and therefore uses 100% of its potential, whereas nuclear and fossil power wastes about a third of its fuel. They also lose a large proportion of the remaining two thirds in transmission costs from generating plants over long distance to connect with the grid. Wind and solar power coming from smaller generating plants can and should be connected to local networks and will therefore be able to reduce losses in transmission. This will also reduce the length, cost and viability of any new pylon lines. Thus, had we committed ourselves to a 10-year programme of non-nuclear electricity, we would have achieved a steady increase in output and eliminated the risk of the lights going out with the stubborn persistence in choosing Hinkley Point. Harvey Cole Winchester, Hampshire • In his article on Hinkley Point, your journalist writes “business solutions are often described as zero-sum, or win-win”. In fact, zero-sum (+1 -1) means the opposite: one winner, one loser.

And indeed the argument can still be heard that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will ruin our economies – even that it will return us to a pre-industrial living standard. A quarter of a century later, the approach that we took has been richly vindicated. As research published on Monday by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit demonstrates, in that period the average Briton has grown richer faster than citizens of any other G7 nation; at the same time, his or her carbon footprint has fallen faster than in any other G7 nation. While it would be stretching reality to argue that Britain’s economic success has been driven by its climate change policies, no one can seriously argue any more that our climate policies have generated economic harm. I would argue that there are three principal factors why Britain tops the G7 league in terms of growing our economy while reducing our carbon emissions. We started earlier than most, we have been consistent, and we have used market forces wherever possible. Certainly our decision now looks to have been a prudent investment. British companies in low-carbon goods and services already turn over an estimated £83bn per year; and with Brexit opening the door for a new era of free trade with major countries in Asia and Latin America, most of which are pursuing their own clean energy transitions, this sector has the potential to become a major engine of trade and growth. When I was negotiating the UN climate convention 25 years ago, the reality was that we did not know what it would cost to fulfil the treaty’s goal of preventing “dangerous” climate change. Science had not clearly told us what degree of global warming would be “dangerous”; nor did any government have a fully fledged plan for reversing the upward tide of carbon emissions. We acted in the absence of perfect information because we had to. Margaret Thatcher had warned world leaders three years previously that humanity was “changing the environment of our planet in damaging and dangerous ways”, and that the only route to curbing it was a global treaty that did not constrain economic growth – because only growing economies would be able to afford the investment necessary to restrain greenhouse gas emissions. To a certain extent, her global climate treaty was a leap of faith in both the probity and the innovative capacity of humankind. Since 1992 science has shown us ever more clearly what “dangerous” climate change looks like. Meanwhile, evidence has been growing that a transition to a low-carbon economy is economically feasible, and will bring added benefits such as cleaner air in major cities. These two factors drove all governments to conclude the Paris agreement in 2015. Globally, carbon emissions have remained flat for the past three years, even as the world economy has grown by 7.5%. China and India are fast reversing their previous policies of building greater fleets of coal-fired power stations. Replacing our own use of coal with gas and renewable energy has brought UK carbon emissions down to a level last seen during the general strike of 1926. Yet neither these remarkable developments nor the Paris agreement will secure a stable climate. The latest science tells us that greenhouse gas emissions need to start declining by 2020 at the latest in order to give reasonable confidence that global warming will stay well below the 2C limit, the target governments adopted in Paris. So, having halted the once unstoppable tide, the next logical step is to reverse it – and quickly. This is the mission on which a new initiative launched by Christiana Figueres, until recently the UN’s top climate official, will embark this coming week. Figueres is to be commended for her vision. The rationale remains exactly that which the British government put forward 25 years ago: thatunchecked, climate change presents unacceptable risks for the future. Fortunately these are not risks that we have to take. Britain has proved the doom-mongers wrong: economies can thrive while emissions fall. Now let us put our collective weight behind the Figueres initiative, and finish the job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/30/robert-llewellyns-quest-to-spur-a-green-energy-revolution-in-his-village","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T14:55:45Z","webTitle":"Robert Llewellyn's quest to spur a green energy revolution in his village","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/30/robert-llewellyns-quest-to-spur-a-green-energy-revolution-in-his-village","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/30/robert-llewellyns-quest-to-spur-a-green-energy-revolution-in-his-village","fields":{"headline":"Robert Llewellyn's quest to spur a green energy revolution in his village","bodyText":"Robert Llewellyn is not a typical eco-activist. “Oh, I’m absolutely un-green,” says the actor and TV presenter. “I’m as un-green as a corporate exec. I fly a lot. Though I have hugged a tree. Actually, I’ve lent against one while I was having a wee in the woods, I’m not sure if that counts?” You don’t need to wear an environmental hairshirt, however, to believe it’s possible to live in a different, more sustainable way. For the actor, who presented Scrapheap Challenge on Channel 4 and is best known for playing Kryten on BBC2’s Red Dwarf, that belief stemmed from a longstanding passion for new technologies, particularly renewable energy. Why, he wondered, were we all powering our cars, cities and homes with carbon-based energy, shipped hundreds of miles or more from big, polluting power plants? Surely technological advances meant we could be generating our power in different ways, and much closer to home? Even, perhaps, if you lived in a tiny clutch of houses in the Cotswolds countryside? So Llewellyn set out to test his thesis in his home village in Gloucestershire. The result is The Great Village Green Crusade, to be screened on Thursday on BBC4, which captures Llewellyn’s quest to persuade Temple Guiting, a community that has been around since the Domesday Book, that it could generate its own electricity and find itself at the cutting edge of the green energy revolution. That, at least, was the plan. The year-long quest was in fact filmed over two and a half, owing to the daunting and occasionally insurmountable hurdles that Llewellyn and a small band of heroically enthusiastic neighbours encountered almost every step of the way. “We didn’t have to fake any jeopardy, that’s for sure,” he says. The biggest problem, to Llewellyn’s surprise, was not convincing residents of the village where he has lived for 25 years (“another 25 and you’ll almost be local,” according to a local farmer). His pitch to the community was not moral but economic, highlighting the fact that the village could make money from the scheme. “But what was interesting was a lot of people saying: ‘We can’t treat the planet the way we have been, we have to change.’ Particularly the older members of the village, who you would think might be the most dismissive of it, were really keen.” Temple Guiting sits on a small tributary of the Thames, near pleasingly blustery low hills and under as much sun as any other spot in the south-west of England. But Llewellyn’s hopes that hydroelectric, wind or solar power would prove an easy solution to the village’s energy needs and allow them to feed a surplus to the national grid, generating income for the village, were rapidly dashed. The stream in Temple Guiting did not have enough force to make hydroelectric power feasible. The options for solar energy were also limited – not, as one might think, because of the British weather, but thanks to tree cover (“the village is built in a wood, basically”) and, inevitably, listing restrictions. But the biggest problem emerged when Llewellyn started looking into wind energy and was told he could generate all the power he liked, but because of the ageing infrastructure of their local branch of the national grid there was no practical way to upload it to the network. “That was genuinely really depressing, because it just felt like – there’s no way round this.” A solution – or a start, at least – was eventually found. Within a few months, the villagers hope, they will install their first solar panels on the roof of a farmer’s barn; he will pay them for the energy, generating a small income (“more than a jumble sale but it’s not a vast amount of money”) for the village. It is, insists Llewellyn, only the beginning. The National Grid may not be able to take their power, but huge leaps forward in battery technology mean Temple Guiting should be able to generate more energy – from a range of sources that could include small-scale domestic solar or wind generators – and store it in the village. “That’s the next phase, and that’s what I would love to do here – that we all buy electricity off each other.” Within five years, he hopes, Temple Guiting could be in a position to run its own small power company. Which might be fine in a tiny community where a local enthusiast knows everyone, but is this replicable in bigger towns and cities? “Oh it’s certainly replicable, simply because a lot of other communities have already done it,” he says. The actor cites schemes in Oxford, Brixton and even on Orkney, and the film shows Llewellyn travelling to Las Vegas, which meets all of its municipal power needs through renewable energy, leading Llewellyn to jokingly attempt to twin Temple Guiting with Sin City. “If we were genuinely the first people to try this then you could say: ‘God, it’s crazy, don’t even try.’ But there are an enormous number of examples of other communities who have done this on a much bigger scale, and it’s very successful. So yes, this is very, very doable.” After putting so much personal energy into the project, he must be looking forward to seeing the panels finally going up on the farmer’s roof? “It will be nice when it’s on there,” he says. “Though it’s been such a hard slog that rather than cheering, I might just have a long sleep.” • This article was amended on 2 June 2017 to use lower case in a reference to the national grid to differentiate the country’s electricity transmission network from National Grid, an international energy company based in the UK and US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/nov/24/adani-to-build-one-of-worlds-most-advanced-solar-farms-near-queensland-mining-town","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-24T05:57:36Z","webTitle":"Adani to build 'one of world's most advanced' solar farms near Queensland mining town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/24/adani-to-build-one-of-worlds-most-advanced-solar-farms-near-queensland-mining-town","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/nov/24/adani-to-build-one-of-worlds-most-advanced-solar-farms-near-queensland-mining-town","fields":{"headline":"Adani to build 'one of world's most advanced' solar farms near Queensland mining town","bodyText":"Adani, which is vying to build Australia’s largest coalmine, has announced the site of a $200m solar farm near a central Queensland mining town. The Indian energy conglomerate plans to build a 100-200 MW solar plant on 600ha that was formerly part of the Rugby Run grazing property near Moranbah. Adani, India’s largest solar generator, said on Thursday the Rugby Run solar farm would be “one of the world’s most advanced solar energy plants”. The company’s first solar foray in Australia has prompted rare praise from environmental groups, including one that has taken it on in court over its bitterly contested Carmichael coal project near Bowen. Peter McCallum, of Mackay Conservation Group, said on Monday the company’s latest move would bring it far more widespread support. “Adani is fundamentally an energy company, not a miner, and its expertise is shifting rapidly towards becoming a clean energy producer in India and now in Australia.” Rugby Run is the first of a number of solar projects through which Adani plans to provide up to 1500MW in Australia within the next five years. Adani said: “The solar projects are part of Adani’s balanced approach to power generation with coal-fired, solar and wind plants supporting the energy policies of the nations in which Adani operates.” Anne Baker, the mayor of Isaac regional council, said the solar plant was an “exciting” development for a local government area that contains 24 of Queensland’s operating coalmines and produces 63% of its saleable coal. “It’s fantastic to see a project that will diversify our economy from its dominant mining base,” she said. Adani said it would start building the Rugby Run plant in mid-2017 and finish within 12 months. The construction would create up to 350 jobs, while five fulltime staff would then operate the solar farm. Adani has applied to public utility Powerlink to connect the plant and feed into the state electricity network. The company has built 793MW of solar generating capacity in India to date, including one of the world’s largest solar plants, a 648MW facility in the southern state of Tamil Nadu."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/apr/18/naval-power-mauritius-looks-to-perth-base-for-renewable-energy-solutions","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-17T22:53:56Z","webTitle":"Naval power: Mauritius looks to Perth base for renewable energy solutions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/18/naval-power-mauritius-looks-to-perth-base-for-renewable-energy-solutions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/18/naval-power-mauritius-looks-to-perth-base-for-renewable-energy-solutions","fields":{"headline":"Naval power: Mauritius looks to Perth base for renewable energy solutions","bodyText":"As home to Australia’s largest naval base, it is no surprise that foreign governments are curious about the secretive goings-on at Garden Island, just offshore from Perth in Western Australia. Peering across from the other side of the Indian Ocean, the Mauritian government is not gathering intelligence on Australia’s military power, however – but rather how the military is powered. More interesting to this tiny island nation than the warships churning in and out of the HMAS Stirling port are the strange hockey puck-shaped undersea CETO 6 tidal energy buoys tethered to the ocean floor. Flush with the kind of research and development cash most Indian Ocean-bordering countries can only dream of, the Royal Australian Navy is developing a $7.5m renewables-based microgrid initially featuring a mix of solar energy (2MW), battery storage (2MW) and a desalination plant, before eventually incorporating undersea wave energy generators that will harness the power of the formidable surf that rolls past this thin fleck of land before crashing upon Perth’s famous beaches. Island nations see Garden Island as a potential template for an energy mix that could help combat the climate change that threatens their very existence. The head honchos in the Australian military are warriors, not eco-warriors, and their preference for renewables is motivated by a belief that they are simply the best strategic option: rather than rely on a vulnerable connection with the mainland power grid or on diesel generators that require the importing of fuel, the RAH has opted for a truly self-sufficient system. Impressed by what has been achieved so far at HMAS Stirling – the project will start generating energy in mid-2017 – the Mauritian government has roped in Carnegie Clean Energy, the Australian developers of the Garden Island microgrid, to draw up a renewable energy roadmap for the country backed with a $800,000 contribution from the Australian and Mauritian governments. Mauritius is targeting renewable energy production exceeding 35% of the electricity generation mix by 2025 from a 2016 level of 20% (mostly sugarcane-based generation). Yet Carnegie’s managing director, Mike Ottaviano, tells the Guardian that his company is designing a microgrid solution that could reach an even more ambitious target of 65% within a decade, vastly exceeding the targets of many major industrialised economies. “They know their solar resource, their wind resource, really well but they don’t know their surf resource, so we’ve deployed measurement buoys in the ocean at the most prospective sites, doing recordings which will allow us to model resource around the island to work out the best place to build,” he says. Ottaviano is setting up his company to serve as a “one-stop shop” for island microgrids, offering design, construction, operation and maintenance services. “I think there’s no community more ready for a renewable microgrid than an island, for a range of reasons,” he says. “The fact they feel the effect of climate change more than most is absolutely a big driver. Layer that with the cost of power on islands, reliance on diesel and the energy security point of view – that’s why they are early adopters.” Analysis released in late 2016 by Afrobarometer on opinions about renewables in Mauritius concluded the population is onboard with their government’s aggressive pushing of green energy. University of the South Pacific social scientist Andreas Kopf, who co-authored the analysis, says the biggest surprise was that 70% of the 1200 respondents supported large-scale implementation of renewables, even if it meant higher electricity bills. Just 11% were opposed. “This is remarkable in the sense that people’s concern over the environment and climate frequently makes a halt when their support requires personal real life sacrifices, for instance when they have to dig into their own pocket [even if they could afford it],” he says. “This seems to be somewhat different in the case of Mauritius, where support is still considerably high among those who experience some level of lived poverty.” The 1.3m-strong population of Mauritius are getting their way, with notable renewable energy projects to be rolled out in recent years including a 9MW windfarm by the French company Quadran in 2016 and local firm Sarako Ltd delivering a 15MW solar PV farm in 2014. Carnegie is targeting completion of design of wave energy solutions for the island within a month and Ottaviano says the company is also consulting with Nauru, Kiribati, Cocos Islands and the Seychelles. He cautions, however, that the openness of communities and governments to the technology “doesn’t make it an easy market to crack”. “One factor is they are remote – as an aggregate it is a very large market but the reality is it is fragmented with lots of small islands,” he says. “You are often dealing with poorly funded and poorly capitalised communities and governments, so there are finance challenges. Then there are climatic risks, community risks and dealing with diverse languages and cultures.” Desperate to prove to the world that renewable energy microgrids are the way forward, Mauritius and its island neighbours will be hoping companies like Carnegie determine the risks are worth braving."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/dec/06/google-renewable-energy-target-solar-wind-power","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-06T16:53:11Z","webTitle":"Google, Apple, Facebook race towards 100% renewable energy target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/dec/06/google-renewable-energy-target-solar-wind-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/dec/06/google-renewable-energy-target-solar-wind-power","fields":{"headline":"Google, Apple, Facebook race towards 100% renewable energy target","bodyText":"Tech giants are jockeying to be the first to hit a 100% renewable energy goal. Google, which has invested in solar and wind energy for a decade, intends to get there by 2017. Google is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, and plans to buy enough wind and solar energy to offset all the electricity used by its 13 data centers and offices in 150 cities worldwide, the company said Tuesday. Apple seems close to reaching its own 100% goal as well. The company said it achieved 93% in 2015. An Apple spokeswoman said the company has yet to set a year for when they would likely cross the finish line. For Google, hitting the 100% target means for every unit of electricity it consumes – typically from coal or natural gas power plants – it would buy a unit of wind or solar electricity. The company wouldn’t say how much electricity it will need to have purchased by the end of next year to reach its 100% goal, but did say that the amount would exceed the 5.7 terawatt-hours solar and wind energy that it bought in 2015. “We want to run our business in an environmentally responsible way, and energy consumption is the largest portion,” said Neha Palmer, head of energy strategy and development at Google’s Global Infrastructure Group. Google is taking a big leap to that 100% goal, having achieved just 37% in 2014. The company has invested in renewable energy ever since it kicked off the construction of a 1.6-megawatt solar energy system in 2006. Since 2010, it’s signed 2.6 gigawatts worth of solar and wind contracts. The tech giant isn’t alone in setting the 100% target. A global campaign to promote 100% renewable energy use in the business world includes Ikea, Facebook, Starbucks and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Businesses, like homeowners, have historically relied on their local utilities for power. In 2015, about 67% of the electricity generated in the US came from fossil fuels. Businesses would have to build and run their own solar or wind farms if they want to hit their 100% more quickly, but that will require hefty investments and expertise they don’t have. As a result, when companies set strong renewable energy goals, they often reach them by buying enough solar and wind electricity or renewable energy credits to offset their use of electricity from coal or natural gas power plants. Some companies, such as Google and Microsoft, have invested in solar and wind power plants to help increase the amount of renewable energy the local electric grids. Or, using their clout as large energy customers, they work on convincing their local utilities to invest in renewable energy. Once extremely expensive, solar and wind have seen their prices falling significantly in the past 10 years. Government tax breaks have also helped to make solar and wind more affordable to both businesses and homeowners. The price for building large solar farms, that have the scale to provide utilities, dropped 12% in 2015, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, part of the US Department of Energy. Market analysts expect the prices to continue to fall even with the abundance of cheap coal and natural gas. The pressure on countries around the world to meet their targets from the Paris climate agreement, which went into effect last month, will make renewable energy attractive, said Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The research firm has projected that solar and wind will become the cheapest sources of electricity for “most of the world” after 2030. “Renewable energy has become incredibly cost effective,” said Dan Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California-Berkeley. “There is no company on the planet that can’t make a 100% energy target a viable, cost-effective strategy.” Yet most businesses have yet to set a renewable energy target. That’s because cost isn’t the only issue. Big companies tend to have an advantage over smaller firms because they have the resources to understand the energy markets and negotiating contracts to buy renewable energy, said Colin Smith, solar analyst for GTM Research. “You’re talking about very complex deals and arrangements with unique risk profiles that most companies aren’t fully well equipped to understand,” he said. Google currently pays for wind and solar power from 20 renewable energy projects in the US and abroad, in places such as Sweden and Chile. However, it doesn’t limit itself to buying solar and wind only in regions where it operates, and sees itself as a champion of reducing the emissions produced by the electric industry, which is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US. “Wind and solar developers couldn’t get financing without us guaranteeing to pay for the power in the long term,” said Palmer. Setting the 100% renewable energy goal is not the only way to reduce a company’s carbon footprint, said Dan Reicher, executive director of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford University. Businesses should first look at cutting down on their energy use and becoming more energy efficient, said Reicher. That will then reduce the amount of renewable energy they need to procure. “Energy efficiency tends not to sound as sexy, just as putting solar panels on your roof is more interesting than putting an efficient furnace in your basement,” he said. “But from an economic and environmental perspective, you want to start with energy efficiency.” Reicher also noted that electricity isn’t always the biggest source of energy for a business. FedEx, for example, uses far more energy in transportation, he said. “Often a big chunk of a company’s business goes beyond electricity,” said Reicher. “What are they doing on the industrial side, on the transportation side, for heating and cooling?” The election of Donald Trump as president has worried renewable energy supporters about the progress made to make solar and wind competitive against coal and natural gas. With the new administration under Donald Trump, renewable energy supporters worry that the government will stop supporting renewable energy. Trump has vowed to revive the coal industry, which has seen half a dozen bankruptcies in recent years as it struggles to compete with the cheaper natural gas. But whether the new administration will create anti-renewable energy policies remains to be seen, Reicher said. Google doesn’t anticipate changes to its renewable energy initiatives in the near future. “The results of any one election won’t change our plans,” said Palmer."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2017/jun/03/its-way-past-time-to-speak-truth-to-climate-arguments-this-stupid","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-03T00:16:49Z","webTitle":"It's way past time to speak truth to climate arguments this stupid | Lenore Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/03/its-way-past-time-to-speak-truth-to-climate-arguments-this-stupid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jun/03/its-way-past-time-to-speak-truth-to-climate-arguments-this-stupid","fields":{"headline":"It's way past time to speak truth to climate arguments this stupid","bodyText":"For precious decades experts have explained, over and over, that the science of climate change is incontrovertible, the consequences of blindly sticking with fossil fuels catastrophic and the costs of inaction far higher than switching to a low-emissions economy. But these facts had no impact on the sceptics, who cling to a worldview where they find “alternative facts”, where fossil fuel power is the only path to prosperity and mounting environmental and economic evidence to the contrary is some kind of dastardly leftwing plot. For Tony Abbott’s economic adviser Maurice Newman, global warming was a “hook” used by the United Nations to impose a new world order in opposition to “capitalism and freedom”. To Donald Trump it is a “hoax” propagated by the Chinese to undermine the US while the rest of the world rolls around laughing. The only skerrick of positive news from sceptics’ greatest victory yet – the US president’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord – is that it seems to have galvanised politicians, scientists, business leaders and economists who have grown weary from all these years talking to the hand. Because now it is clearer than ever that the economic interests Trump claims to defend can only be served by acting on global warming. It is way past time to speak some more loud, blunt truth to arguments this stupid. To make the ridiculous case that abandoning Paris was good for the US economy, Trump didn’t just have to ignore science, but also the pleading of the US business community he was purporting to defend – the 630 business leaders who wrote to him in January demanding that he keep Barack Obama’s climate plan and stick with the Paris deal, and the long list of businesses and business leaders who have attacked his decision, including the chief executives of Tesla, Goldman Sachs and Disney and companies including Nike, BP, IBM, Apple, Google, Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Adobe, Morgan Stanley, Unilever and Mars. The truth is, he has clear evidence that renewable energy jobs in the US are booming and that his campaign promises on coal industry jobs will be impossible to keep. The contentious job figures he advanced to make his case for abandoning Paris came from a study which made some highly questionable assumptions to reach its conclusions, including that it would “not take into account potential benefits from avoided emissions”. The real-world evidence is very different. As the director of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, points out in the Conversation: “The increase in employment in solar energy alone over the past three years is more than twice the total number of jobs in the coalmining industry in the United States (which are declining).” Meanwhile in Australia, the mind-numbing years of climate “war” have ground us to a policy paralysis. Malcolm Turnbull dare not make a decisive move lest he startle the sceptics and fossil fuel advocates still lurking in his own party ranks (like the visionary Craig Kelly, chair of the Coalition’s environment committee, who tweeted he had “champagne on ice” in preparation for the Trump announcement, then celebrated it by declaring: “There is a more efficient way to generate energy than using fossil fuels, it’s just that mankind hasn’t yet worked it out yet”). And so the government continues its zigzag trajectory – quietly searching for a viable policy while periodically veering back to mouth some nonsense to calm the conservatives. It has reaffirmed its backing for the Paris agreement but still has no policy to meet its commitments and has rejected, for raw political reasons, some of the best options available to the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, who has been charged with finding something resembling a solution. Turnbull talks with real enthusiasm about the manifold possibilities of renewable power and pumped hydro storage, but then his treasurer fondles coal in question time. The government carefully floats the idea of a low-emissions energy target – not dissimilar to the existing renewable energy target, which could be reasonable policy but could also be risible if the emissions benchmarks allow it to cover what the minerals’ industry PR likes to refer to as “low-emissions” coal-fired power without insisting its emissions be captured and stored. It claims to understand the maths of the climate threat confronting the world and then (like Queensland Labor) considers massive taxpayer subsidies to help the enormous new Adani coalmine that would, on its own, contribute 0.5% of all the carbon that can be emitted before the globe exceeds 2C warming when its coal is burned. Like Trump, politicians tout the Queensland mine as a provider of regional jobs, “tens of thousands” of them, they say, again and again. But to believe that you have to ignore Adani’s own expert witness, who admitted in court the actual jobs figure was just 1,464 direct and indirect positions. To accept the project’s commercial viability you have to ignore the assessment of the biggest Australian banks, which have concluded they would not lend to a project of this type – or, if you are the resources minister, Matt Canavan, even try to foment a consumer revolt against them for reaching that commercial conclusion. And to argue this is the best use of a taxpayer subsidy you have to close your eyes to the many thousands of actual jobs governments are, or could be, supporting in the renewable industry in the same general region, projects such as the Whitsunday solar farm, the Longreach solar farm, the Kidston solar farm, the Collinsville solar power station or Telstra’s $100m project announced this week at Emerald. To insist that coal will play a long-term part in Australia’s new energy generation you have to wilfully ignore the reality of the targets we’ve set ourselves, the ones we say we will stick to, and the plummeting costs of renewables such as solar and wind. The truth is, we really cannot walk both sides of this street. We’re either on the side of Trump and his sceptics, or on the side of the facts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2019/may/15/may-to-face-mps-as-rebels-warn-she-is-still-facing-defeat-in-brexit-vote-in-early-june-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-15T16:17:25Z","webTitle":"UK will face either no-deal or no Brexit if MPs vote down withdrawal agreement, ministers insist – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/may/15/may-to-face-mps-as-rebels-warn-she-is-still-facing-defeat-in-brexit-vote-in-early-june-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2019/may/15/may-to-face-mps-as-rebels-warn-she-is-still-facing-defeat-in-brexit-vote-in-early-june-live-news","fields":{"headline":"UK will face either no-deal or no Brexit if MPs vote down withdrawal agreement, ministers insist – as it happened","bodyText":"Downing Street has hinted that the Commons vote on the withdrawal agreement bill will be make or break for Theresa May’s future as prime minister, as ministers have warned that, if she loses, the UK will face a choice between no-deal and no Brexit. (See 3.20pm.) Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has urged the home secretary to introduce flexible immigration rules for skilled workers after Brexit to avoid vacancies in certain industries. As the Press Association reports, Gove claims to have called on Sajid Javid to “look flexibly in how we interpret what a skilled worker is,” and criticised the £30,000 salary threshold for immigrant workers. Giving evidence to Holyrood’s rural economy committee, Gove said that assessing whether a migrant worker qualified as skilled by their salary was not appropriate for all industries. Questioned about “significant vacancies” of approximately 30% in the fish processing sector in Scotland by the SNP’s Stewart Stevenson, Gove argued that the migration advisory committee’s recommendation of the minimum earnings for a worker to be allowed to stay after Brexit would harm businesses who rely on foreign labour. Gove said: Pitching the level at which you define a skilled worker as someone earning over £30,000 a year wasn’t actually responsive to the particular needs - not just of the fish processing sector - but the food and drink sector overall. One of the points that I have made to the home secretary and others is that we look flexibly at how we interpret what a skilled worker is in line with specific industries. Four members of the Welsh assembly - three Ukip AMs and Mark Reckless, who left Ukip in 2017 to join the Conservative group - have defected to the Brexit party. They have asked to be recognised as an official Brexit party group in the assembly. (See 3.29pm.) The consumers organisation Which? has criticised Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, for saying chlorinated chicken is not a food safety issue. (See 11.17am.) In a statement Caroline Normand, the Which? director of advocacy, said: Liam Fox is wrong to suggest chlorinated chicken is not a food safety and standards issue. One of the reasons why food-borne disease rates are so much higher in the US is that these measures are often used as a desperate attempt to make up for widespread safety problems in food production - leaving bacteria like salmonella to run rampant. Our research has shown British consumers are united in their opposition to lowering food standards as part of any future trade deal - with nearly seven in 10 saying they would be uncomfortable eating chlorine-washed chicken. Brexit is an opportunity to design a joined up food and farming policy that ensures food is produced to the highest standards - the nation’s health needs must not be used as a bargaining chip that could be given away to facilitate transatlantic trade. Labour’s plan to nationalise Britain’s energy network would make the country poorer, hinder efforts to tackle climate change, and threatens a return to the frequent power cuts of the past, the UK’s leading business lobby group has warned. Parliament is to receive an overhaul of its publicly displayed art work, with dozens of former and current female politicians and campaigners to be introduced to the walls of the Palace of Westminster. The government does not know how many British users may have been affected by a “terrifying” WhatsApp security breach, MPs have been told. As the Press Association reports, shadow culture secretary Tom Watson warned a security flaw in the messaging app could be used by states to monitor human rights groups. The digital minister, Margot James, said the likelihood of there being UK victims of the attack is being investigated but said, as yet, there is no information about how many people could have been targeted. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from Anne Milton, the skills minister. Good job it’s not national literacy day ... Theresa May is now in Paris for an event with world leaders who are agreeing a plan to eliminate terrorist and violent content online. It is called the Christchurch Call because New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has worked up the plan in response to the Christchurch mosque attacks in March. Here is some new polling on the European elections from Survation. The House of Commons library often produces the best briefings on election results, and it has now published its document (pdf) on the English local elections. If you want a very detailed account, this is what you need. Here’s a chart from the report. The government’s claim that a vote against the withdrawal agreement in June will leave the UK with a choice between no-deal and no Brexit depends on the assumption that the EU will not agree to another article 50 extension. As explained at 9.52am, that assumption is not well founded. And now it has emerged that Jacek Czaputowicz, Poland’s foreign minister, has said publicly that the EU should be willing to grant another extension to allow time for the UK to change its mind about Brexit. As Reuters reports, in comments released late last night, Czaputowicz said: From Poland’s point of view, it would be good if Brexit would not happen. It’s a matter of changing the rhetoric to let the Brits rethink their decision. We should go soft on Britain, give them time, they are still in the EU, let’s give them space to take decision. Change UK MPs are criticising Labour after Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman refused to rule out the party abstaining on the EU withdrawal agreement bill at a briefing. This is from Chuka Umunna. And this is from Chris Leslie. Four Welsh assembly members are seeking to band together to form a Brexit party group. The four include Mark Reckless, who has been a Tory MP and a Ukip and Tory AM. He has resigned from the Tory group. The three others, Mandy Jones, Caroline Jones and David Rowlands, have all been Ukip AMs. They have written to the Llywydd - the assembly’s equivalent of a speaker – notifying her of their wish to form a political group. Mark Reckless told a press conference on the Senedd steps: Brexit is being blocked and the Brexit party group in the Welsh assembly from today will be supporting Nigel Farage, supporting the Brexit party in everything that they are doing to protect our democracy and to ensure that Brexit is delivered. Other parties are not happy. A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: We consider this announcement today as having very serious implications for our democracy and our democratic principles here in the Senedd. The Brexit party did not stand and were not elected in the 2016 elections. They have no democratic mandate and they should not be permitted to form a group nor given access to public resources and funding in the Senedd. To permit them to form a group would make a mockery of our democratic system in Wales. The Senedd is not a playground for Brexiteer chancers, it is the home of Welsh democracy. We eagerly anticipate the Llywydd’s ruling in the full expectation that she will do the right thing and allow democracy to prevail. This is what Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, told the Lords EU committee earlier about how a defeat for the EU withdrawal agreement bill at second reading would leave the UK a choice between a no-deal Brexit and no Brexit. He said: I think if the House of Commons does not approve the WAB then the Barnier deal is dead in that form and I think the house will have to then address a much more fundamental question between whether it will pursue ... a no-deal option or whether it will revoke. This is what Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, was also saying this morning (see 11.17am), as well as Downing Street. (See 9.52am.) Labour sources are playing down suggestions the party might abstain on the EU withdrawal agreement bill, PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield reports. HuffPost’s Paul Waugh thinks that in the end Labour won’t abstain on the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill. Theresa May has been offered a possible lifeline ahead of a key vote on her Brexit deal next month after Labour refused to rule out abstaining. The government has announced that MPs will vote on the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill in the first week in June, in what will effectively be the fourth vote on May’s withdrawal agreement. If the government were to lose, that would be fatal to May’s Brexit strategy, and her premiership, and there is no evidence she is winning over the MPs who voted against it last time. (See 9.25am.) But Labour has refused to rule out abstaining in the second reading vote. It is highly unusual for the opposition to abstain on such a major piece of legislation, and if Labour were to adopt this approach (which is nothing more than an option at the moment, based on this afternoon’s briefing), anti-Brexit members would be alarmed. But an abstention would lead to the bill getting a second reading, with the key vote effectively postponed until MPs voted on the amended bill at third reading. Labour’s move came as ministers argued that, if MPs were to vote down the bill, the UK would face a choice between no-deal and no Brexit. (See 11.17am.) The lead candidate for Change UK in Scotland’s European parliament contest has switched sides to the Liberal Democrats, in further signs the new party is struggling to consolidate itself or spread successfully across the UK. (See 10.36am.) Jeremy Corbyn has used PMQs to attack the “scandal of inequality in modern Britain”. He said: In Great Yarmouth, one has just been opened for pupils at a school, and last week the department of business established a food bank for its own staff in the building on Victoria Street. Can the prime minister tell us what is going wrong in modern Britain that a government office in the centre of London has a food bank for some of its very low-paid staff to get something to eat? In response, May argued that inequality was also a problem under Labour and that income inequality had fallen since 2010. Lone parents and their children have lost challenges against the government’s benefit cap at the UK’s highest court. Penny Mordaunt, the new defence secretary, has said she would like a planned new law offering an amnesty on historical prosecutions for military veterans who served in Iraq, Afghanistan and anywhere else around the world to also cover Northern Ireland. The government has been criticised for rejecting a proposed working definition of Islamophobia that has been adopted by parties including Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Conservatives. Jeremy Corbyn will outline plans to nationalise Britain’s energy network in a move that would transfer companies to public ownership soon after a Labour election win. A catalogue of errors by the Home Office has led to a loss of access to £600,000 of EU funds earmarked for the most deprived people in Britain and has put a further £2.9m at risk, it can be revealed. Here is more on Labour refusing to rule out abstaining on the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill. From the Daily Mirror’s Pippa Crerar From the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn From the Daily Mail’s Jason Groves This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. And these are from the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn. These are from my colleague Heather Stewart. PMQs - Snap verdict: Yesterday, in response to Bridget Prentice’s resignation from the party, Labour issued a statement saying its “bold and popular policies under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership have changed the political conversation in this country” and today he focused on a topic, inequality, where undoubtedly opinion is moving his way. You can argue about how much this is due to Corbyn personally - even that bastion of neoliberalism, the IMF, was warning about inequality in 2014, long before Corbyn became Labour leader - but the announcement this week that the Institute for Fiscal Studies has launched a major review of the consequences of inequality is a clear vindication of one of core political themes. The IFS has always been much more associated with fiscal rectitude than social justice, and if even it recognises there is a problem, Corbyn is winning the argument. A sensible prime minister would recognise this, and engage. But instead May just refused to accept that there is anything wrong. It was an unconvincing performance that saw her easily outmatched by Corbyn. But it was still all a bit underwhelming - largely because, with May effectively now at the point where she is working out her notice, who cares what she has to say anyway? This became painfully apparent when she had to respond to a question about the next spending round - which is one that will be overseen by her successor. In her exchanges with Corbyn, and the SNP’s Ian Blackford, it felt that May was not even trying particularly hard. But PMQs did throw up two policies issues where the debate over the coming months is likely to intensify. Corbyn proudly defended Labour’s plan to extend its real living wage to under-18s. There is a genuine debate to be had about whether this can be done without increasing youth unemployment, but the arguments did not really get much of a hearing today. Interestingly, May herself chose to raise another Labour proposal - its qualified support for universal basic income. But, again, the rights and wrongs of this were not thrashed out in today’s debate. That will have to wait for another day. Corbyn used to make a point of using the “letter from an ordinary voter” device to frame an awkward question for the PM. Today it was the Tory Brexiter Peter Bone who tried this. It allowed him to tell May she should resign, but in a manner that discouraged a blunt response (because the activists who supposedly drafted this letter would deserve a polite reply). But Bone just got the usual May brush-off. Even calls for May’s resignation can’t really enliven PMQs very much now. Stephen Kerr, a Conservative, says Scottish Tories see May as a trenchant champion of the union. Does May agree the shared prosperity fund will provide an opportunity to strengthen the union? Will it be led by needs, and not Barnettised? May says the fund will strengthen the union, and it will be led be needs. And that’s it. PMQs is over. Peter Bone, a Conservative, says he has got an incredible group of activists in his constituency who have campaigned regularly for the party. But he has a letter from them. They do not like her Brexit deal. And they have lost confidence in May. They want her to resign before the European elections. What message does May have for them? May praises all Conservatives who campaign. She thanks them for their work. This is a government that wants to deliver Brexit, she says. If MPs had voted for it, the UK would already be out, she says. Labour’s Albert Owen says a constituent died after being shot with a crossbow outside his house. Will the law on crossbows be reviewed? May says this is a very worrying story. Labour’s Louise Haigh asks about a BBC report saying four children have been killed after family courts ordered that abusive parents should have access to them. Will she order a public inquiry? May says new guidance on this was issued to courts last week. The Ministry of Justice has not seen evidence to justify an inquiry, she says, but she says justice minister will meet Haigh to discuss this. Neil O’Brien, a Conservative, asks about access to a particular drug on the NHS. May says she is pleased the NHS and Nice have reached an agreement to make it available. Labour’s Caroline Flint asks May to welcome a ruling condeming the blacklisting of trade unionists. And does she agree that trade unions play an important role? May says unions do have an important role to play. The government wants to see workers rights improved, she says. Antoinette Sandbach, a Conservative, is asking a question about bereaved parents. But she is interrupted by an announcement from a speaker broadcasting into the chamber saying a fire alarm test has been completed. May says this is a worrying time for British Steel workers. The government struck a deal with the company last month to help it meet its obligations under EU emissions laws. Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire says the PM says it is her deal, no-deal or no exit. But MPs have voted against her deal and no-deal. So will she admit it is no Brexit or a second referendum. May says MPs should vote to implement Brexit. Labour’s Barry Sheerman says he was a passionate Eurosceptic when he became an MP 40 years ago. But he changed his mind when he saw what the EU did for peace and prosperity. Will May tell the truth about Europe, instead of echoing the lies told by Ukip? May says people voted to leave the EU. The government should implement that, she says. Vicky Ford, a Conservative, asks May if she backs the idea of a fund to help universities improve the way they look after students with mental health problems. May says she will ask the health and education secretaries to look at this. Rosie Duffield, a Labour MP, asks if May agrees with Labour about the need to scrap tests for pre-teenage children because they generate stress. May says simple tests that allow judgments to be made about how much children have progressed are useful and should continue. Rebecca Pow, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees Somerset schools need more funding. May says the strong economy allows the government to put more money into schools. The SNP’s Pete Wishart says the Tory backenches look a bit threadbare. The UK is looking a laughing stock. For the sake of the nation, will May go, and let Scotland to too. May says, judging by Wishart’s question, his charm offensive to become next speaker has started. Labour’s Bill Esterson says the government says it wants to tackle climate change. But the reality suggests otherwise. It is investing in fossil fuel projects abroad while denying funding to green energy initiatives. May says the government is investing in the future. She says 99% of solar energy deployed in the UK has been under a Conservative government. Nigel Evans, a Tory Brexiter, asks May to confirm that if the UK stays in the customs union and the single market, it will not have left the EU. May says the UK will end free movement, take control of UK law and end the era of vast payments to the EU. And the UK will not pay for market access, she says. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, says the three-times-defeated Brexit deal will return in June. Has May done a backroom deal with Labour to sell out Scotland. May says it is only the SNP that wants to sell out Scotland. Blackford says the Scottish people do not know what is happening in these secret talks. At the European elections the people of Scotland will make their feelings heard, he says. May says if the SNP vote for the deal, the UK will leave the EU. If people want a party that is not only a Brexit party, but one that can deliver it, they should vote Conservative. Nigel Huddleston, a Conservative, asks if education will get more money in the next spending round. May says the government is committed to improving education for every child. Corbyn says his question was about food banks in a government office. That suggests in-work poverty is the problem, he says. He says the Trussell Trust handed out 1.6m food parcels last year, and 500,000 of them went to children. Will the government restore the link between inflation and welfare payments? May says this government introduced the national living wage. The low paid are taking home a lot more as a result. Corbyn says the IFS says child poverty will rise to over 5m by 2022 because of the government’s policies. The wealth of the richest has inceased by £50bn. But if we do not have enough money to feed people, we have failed as a society. More people are in poverty. When will the government reverse tax giveaways to the rich and end the scandal of inequality in Britain. May says the top 1% are paying more in income tax than they ever did under Labour. Labour is proposing a welfare payment for everyone. That would mean money for the rich paid for by the poor. Corbyn asks how it can be fair for executives to be paid so much more than their workers. Young people suffer in particular, which is why Labour will stop young people being paid a lower minimum wage than older people. Does May agree this is right? May says the Labour policy will cost job. Youth unemployment has fallen by 50%, she says. Corbyn says the Tories opposed the minimum wage. They said it would cost jobs. Why do the Tories continue to punish young people? Wages are lower than a decade ago, housing costs are soared, and more and more food banks are opening. In Great Yarmouth one has been opened for pupils. And the business department has opened one for its staff, he says. May says work is the best way to ensure people have a good standard of living. She says Corbyn has not acknowledged that unemployment is at a record law. She says Corbyn implies inequality started in 2010. But who said the last Labour government ensured inequality got worse. Who was it? Corbyn himself, she says. Corbyn asks about Angus Deaton, the Nobel prize winning economist investigating inequality for the IFS. He says the UK has the second worst record on inequality in the G7. May says wages are going up. Jeremy Corbyn pays tribute to Brian Walden, the former Labour MP and interviewer. He was a formidable interviewer, he says. Every MP has said that - but only afterwards. He also pays tribute to Doris Day, a Hollywood icon and animal rights campaign. He says he is tempted to quote one of her songs - whip crackaway. He says nine hedge fund tycoons have donated millions to the Conservative party. Is this a government for the many or for the few. May also pays tribute to Doris Day. She gave many hours of entertainment, she says. After Corbyn paid tribute to two Labour MPs elected 40 years ago, May says Margaret Thatcher was elected 40 years ago. On inequality, May says income inequality is down since 2010. The Conservatives want everyone to have a better life. Labour wants to bring people down. The Tories want to bring them up. Mark Pawsey, a Conservative, asks about a young carer in his constituency. May says the government has published a cross-government carers’ action plan which is intended to help young carers. The SNP’s Alan Brown asks about transplant case that went wrong. May says she will ensure the relevant minister looks at the case. Theresa May starts by saying she will be going to Paris later for an international summit about stopping terrorists from exploiting the internet. From BrexitCentral’s Jonathan Isaby From the Daily Record’s Torcuil Crichton This is from PA’s Richard Wheeler. PMQs is starting soon. I will post my snap verdict after the whole session is over. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Here is a question from below the line worth addressing. The EU and the UK have agreed to postpone Brexit until 31 October, unless the UK passes the withdrawal agreement before than, which would allow an earlier exit. A British prime minister can unilaterally revoke article 50. But there is no mechanism that would allow a new PM to unilaterally change the 31 October date and trigger an immediate no-deal. That said, a new PM could try to speed the process up by adopting a policy of non-cooperation with the EU (for example, by withholding monthly payments). Or the government could try to bring forward the date of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Act, meaning EU law would no longer apply. But these would be seen as extremely hostile and reckless measures, which would be opposed by parliament and would could cause severe damage to long-term relations with Brussels. Unless Nigel Farage were to become PM before October they are not plausible scenarios, and even he would probably have second thoughts. However, a new PM could insist on a no-deal Brexit on 31 October even if the EU27 all wanted a further extension. That is because article 50 can only be extended again with UK agreement. Turning away from Stephen Barclay for a moment, Penny Mordaunt, the new defence secretary, seems to have made a good impression with the speech she gave this morning. These are from the BBC’s defence correspondent Jonathan Beale. And this is from my colleague John Crace, the Guardian’s sketchwriter. Q: Can you tell us more about the cross-party talks with Labour? Barclay says they have focused on the Labour demands set out in Jeremy Corbyn’s five points. Q: Does the government accept that the MEPs elected next week will have to take their seats? Yes, says Barclay. He says the government wanted to avoid this. Barclay says British MEPs elected next week will take their seats. This means the government has given up hope of trying to pass the Brexit legislation before 2 July, when the new European parliament meets for the first time. Barclay says, if MPs do not vote for the deal next month, it will be dead. Then MPs will face a choice between a no-deal Brexit and revoking article 50. This is the argument we have also heard from Liam Fox this morning (see 11.17am) and from Number 10. UPDATE: Here is the clip. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Lords EU committee. He says the government is keen to publish the EU withdrawal agreement bill as soon as possible. But it is not possible to lock down the text while the talks with Labour are still going on, he says. Q: Do you accept MPs need time to see it before the second reading vote in June? Barclay says he does accept that. But he says many of the issues raised by the bill have been debated. He says he published an open letter yesterday (pdf) that he sent to the Tory Brexiter John Redwood addressing some of Redwood’s concerns about the bill. Here are the main points from Liam Fox’s Q&amp;A at the Institute for Government. Fox, the international development secretary, said that the UK would face either a no-deal Brexit or no Brexit if MPs vote down Theresa May’s deal again next month. Referring to the vote, he said: There will be an opportunity for MPs to decide, after the local elections, after the European elections, whether they want to vote for Brexit or not. MPs will need to look and see if they want to continue down a path that inexorably takes us to either the potential of revocation of article 50 or leaving without a deal, and ask if they think that’s the best course either democratically or economically for the UK. MPs will have to face that decision. Fox is assuming that the EU will not allow a further article 50 extension, which is not a view shared by those who follow Brussels politics closely. (See 9.52am.) Bloomberg’s Rob Hutton is not convinced by the latest Fox/Number 10 argument. Fox said it would be “self-defeating” for the UK to lower food safety standards after Brexit. He said: I have said repeatedly that we will not reduce our standards as we move forward ... There’s a trading reason why we shouldn’t want to change our standards, and that’s because of the impact on our exporters. Barclays did a big global survey of consumers about a year ago now and it showed that 59% of Chinese consumers, about 60% of Indian consumers, would pay more for the same product if they knew it came from the United Kingdom. Why? Because you put that little union flag on it and and it’s regarded as a sign of quality. We can’t compete globally at the low-cost, low-quality end of the market. We have too many fixed cost in our economy. We need therefore to compete at the high-quality end of the market. And therefore the maintenance of our high standards is part of that guaranteed quality in the goods that we export. It would be self-defeating to see us reduce our standards. There’s no advantage from a trading perspective in doing so. But Fox also refused to say the UK should continue to ban US imports of chlorine-washed chicken after Brexit, saying the use of this practice was an animal welfare issue, not a food safety issue. Chlorine-washed chicken was safe to eat, he argued. David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project, was not impressed by Fox’s answer on this. Lone parents and their children have lost challenges against the government’s benefit cap at the UK’s highest court, the Press Association reports. Supreme court justices, sitting in London on Wednesday, rejected the appeals in cases brought against the work and pensions secretary over the lawfulness of the measure by a majority of five to two. This is what David Macdonald is saying about why he has abandoned Change UK, despite being their lead candidate in Scotland for the European elections, and is now backing the Lib Dems. (See 10.36am.) [After a] great deal of reflection on the political landscape we are facing in Scotland at present, I have come to the point where I have realised I must do what is best for the future of this country before anything else. If things continue as they are the remain vote will split in Scotland and put at risk the representation that supporters of remaining in the European Union so collectively desire. For that reason I have decided to end my candidacy for Change UK effective immediately and I am now calling for those in favour of remaining in the European Union, including all supporters of Change UK in Scotland, to do what is best for our collective voice in Europe and to support the Scottish Liberal Democrats in the upcoming European election, to better ensure that they gain representation to secure a seat in these European elections. The lead candidate for Change UK in Scotland’s European parliament contest has switched sides to the Liberal Democrats, in further signs the new party is struggling to consolidate itself or spread successfully across the UK. David Macdonald, an independent councillor in the wealthy district of East Renfrewshire near Glasgow, is expected to confirm shortly he has resigned from Change UK in a joint appearance with Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, near Holyrood. The Scottish Lib Dems said Macdonald will “endorse the Liberal Democrats as the party of remain.” Macdonald, a restaurateur, appears to have deleted his Change UK election Twitter account @davidchangeuk. Change UK have made negligible impact in Scotland, and his defection will likely quash any suggestions it will greatly affect the results on May 23. It has been planning to stage its first and only European elections rally in Edinburgh this Saturday but no venue has been announced. Rennie will hope Macdonald’s switch will boost the Lib Dems’ chances in the election. A recent YouGov poll for the Times put Change UK neck and neck with the Lib Dems in Scotland at 6% each, although there is little expectation the Lib Dems are popular enough to win one of the six Scottish seats on offer. Nikki da Costa, who used to work as director of legislative affairs for Theresa May at Number 10, says if the EU withdrawal agreement bill does get through its second reading, the government will have to accept whatever amendments get added. Q: The US has published their objectives for a trade deal with the UK. They want the UK to relax EU-style food standards. Are you happy with that? Fox says he has said until he is “blue in the face” that the UK will not reduce its standards after Brexit. It has legislation that protects food standards. That will not change. And there are trading reasons for this too. A Barclays survey shows that a majority of Indian and Chinese consumers would pay more for British produce, because they see it as high quality. The UK cannot compete on low standards. There would be no advantage lowering standards. Fox says lowering food standards after Brexit would be bad for UK exports. Q: What about chlorine-washed chicken? Fox says that is a different argument. That is about animal welfare, not food safety. From the BBC’s Norman Smith The WAB is the EU withdrawal agreement bill. It is said to be half an inch thick, which makes it an enormous piece of legislation, which explains Smith’s joke about “light reading”. Q: What would be an acceptable result in the European elections? And would you consider voting for the Brexit party in the Euros? Fox says he will be voting for the Conservatives, for various reasons. MEPs will have to deal with a range of issues, he says. He says the Brexit party is a single issue party. And anything that weakens the Conservatives is good for Jeremy Corbyn, he says. On expectations, he says he is a former Tory chairman. Anything he said on this would be expectation management, or evasive. And he says the question has reminded him to send in his postal vote today. Q: There seems to be little chance of the government winning the Brexit vote in June. So is this just a last throw of the dice? And if Theresa May loses, will she has to stand down? Fox says MPs will have to decide whether they want to take the UK down a path that would lead to either a no-deal Brexit, or article 50 being revoked. MPs will have to take that decision. Fox says UK will face either no-deal or no Brexit if MPs do not vote for Theresa May’s deal in June. This is also the line being briefed by Number 10. (See 9.52am.) UPDATE: Here is the quote. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is now taking questions at the Institute for Government. Q: Your department deals with trade deals outside the EU. But the central trade deal will be with the EU, and your department is not involved in those talks. When will you get involved. Fox says talks are currently going on about how to create a “single architecture”, so that there is not a divergence between the trade regime with the EU and the trade regime with the rest of the world. Q: What if the UK stays in the customs union? Fox says he does not want to see the UK stay in a customs union. He says other countries would not want to sign trade deals with the UK if it were in a temporary customs union with the EU, and they did not know when it was going to end. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, was on the Today programme this morning. He said that he was a “hardliner” on Brexit. But he insisted that the Lib Dems were not blocking progress on the Brexit legislation. They would be happy to vote for the deal, provided it was subject to a confirmatory referendum, he said. He also said that he thought three options should be put to the public in the referendum: the deal, a no-deal Brexit and remain. According to the BBC’s Norman Smith, Number 10 is now arguing that, if Theresa May’s Brexit plan gets defeated in early June, the UK will face either a no-deal Brexit at the end of October or article 50 being revoked. This argument is based on the assumption that the EU would not agree to a further extension of article 50. But EU leaders have never said that explicitly, and the conventional wisdom in Brussels is that a further extension, although not guaranteed, is certainly very possible. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, has just published a very good paper addressing exactly this question. Here is an extract. EU officials don’t trust British MPs to prevent no deal and some of them think it could happen by accident. For example, what if a Boris Johnson-type figure became prime minister in October, and he or she was determined to leave without a deal? That person would refuse to ask for an extension and Parliament would not have time to bring down the government and prevent no deal before October 31st (to which the counter-argument is that no prime minister committed to a no deal Brexit could ever win a parliamentary majority for forming a government in the first place). Some senior figures in Brussels expect the British to receive an extension till June 2020. That is the latest possible date for the EU to agree on its next seven-year budget plan, the multiannual financial framework that starts in 2021, without serious problems arising. In the long run the UK would have to go for an election or referendum or no deal – or possibly a different kind of Brexit, said one figure. But would not Macron veto further extensions? “No, he could not resist the pressure from all the others in the room to compromise.” Another official agrees that the 27 are unlikely to force the UK out by refusing a further extension, but adds that this could change if the British elected a fearsome swarm of Faragist MPs in the European elections. Similarly, a new government led by a hard-line eurosceptic committed to starting fights with the EU could lead the patience of some member-states to snap. My colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels also thinks a further article 50 extension is more likely than not. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is giving a speech at the Institute for Government. There is a live feed here. He started by saying trade policy was only a relatively small part of what his department does (accounting for 20% of staff) and he is now summarising how his department promotes trade. I will post any highlights from the speech and the Q&amp;A. After weeks of procrastination, Theresa May has now announced a date - or rather, three possible dates - for what will be her final attempt to get MPs to vote for her withdrawal agreement. It will be the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill, and it will take place in the week beginning Monday 3 June. But the whitsun recess does not end until the following day, and so the vote will probably take place on either Tuesday 4 June, Wednesday 5 June or Thursday 6 June. Here is the Guardian’s overnight story. So May has three weeks to construct a majority. But it is not there now. Last night the Labour party made it clear that it would not support the bill unless the government strikes a deal with the party over the Brexit outcome it wants and, in a statement, Jeremy Corbyn that was still some way off. The DUP, May’s supposed confidence and supply partners, said they remained opposed to what was on offer. And the smaller opposition parties, the SNP, the Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru, also expressed their continued opposition to the plan. And what about the 34 Conservative who voted against the agreement at the last debate (when other rebels had given in)? Six of them are pro-Europeans, but the rest were hardline Brexiters and one of them, Owen Paterson, told the Today programme this morning that he remained opposed to what was on offer. He said: Sadly, we will vote against it again, as the DUP put out a statement, because it doesn’t change the essential nature of the withdrawal agreement, which is unacceptable we will have laws imposed on us by 27 different countries where we are not involved. And, very importantly for the DUP and us, it potentially breaks up the United Kingdom by creating a new entity called UKNI [UK Northern Ireland] and that means you could end with Scotland wanting to follow and that is really dangerous for the union. We’ll hear from May herself at PMQs. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.05am: Greg Clark, the business secretary, gives a speech at the FT Future of the Car summit. 9.30am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives a speech at the Institute for Government. 10am: Penny Mordaunt, the new defence secretary, gives a speech at the First Sea Lord’s Sea Power Conference. 11.10am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Lords EU committee. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 2.30pm: Google, YouTube and Instagram give evidence to the Commons culture committee. 4pm: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, holds a walkabout in Merthyr Tydfil. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning’s political news.

The 1MW solar farm at Karratha airport, made possible by a $2.3m grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena), has been fitted with state-of-the-art CloudCAM cloud-tracking technology by Fulcrum3D – a technology also backed by a separate $545,000 Arena grant. Dips in power output from solar farms that occur when clouds pass over leads some solar farms to rely on backup energy storage to smooth out the output. The unpredictability of those dips in output also makes it difficult for the operators to predict prices and can hinder their ability to bid in electricity markets. According to the manufacturers, the cloud-tracking technology allows the solar operators to reliably predict the output of the solar farm 15 minutes ahead of time, meaning they can minimise the reliance on energy storage and can more effectively take part in market bidding. The chief executive of Arena, Ivor Frischknecht, said that the technology “makes solar cheaper and reduces intermittency by giving the operators a clearer picture of the solar resource they can expect in the immediate future”. “Cloud prediction makes solar cheaper and more reliable while reducing the need for batteries,” Frischknecht said. “That’s what makes this project so exciting.” The marriage of two separate Arena-funded projects demonstrated the effectiveness of Arena grants and how they were benefiting regional communities, Frischknecht said. Frischknecht said the Karratha airport solar plant would be a good example, demonstrating why more renewables should be connected to Western Australia’s North West Interconnected System (NWIS). The NWIS supplies electricity to Karratha, Port Headland and Goldsworth, as well as areas inland from there. “The NWIS is a smaller network that requires renewable energy to meet performance criteria that are geared towards maintaining network stability,” Frischknecht said. “Arena-supported projects like the Karratha airport solar farm and CloudCAM are important for demonstrating to network owner and operator Horizon Power that solar can provide sustainable, reliable power into the NWIS without the need for large amounts of expensive battery storage,” Frischknecht said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/jul/31/crescent-dunes-concentrated-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-31T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"How sun, salt and glass could help solve our energy needs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/31/crescent-dunes-concentrated-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jul/31/crescent-dunes-concentrated-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"How sun, salt and glass could help solve our energy needs","bodyText":"High in the stark Nevada desert, a couple of hundred miles north-west of Las Vegas, is the shimmering circular mirage of Crescent Dunes. Ten thousand silvery glass panes, each measuring 115 square metres, surround a tall central tower, which stands like a twinkling needle in the featureless landscape around it. Resembling a fabulous alien metropolis, Crescent Dunes is in fact a highly sophisticated, mile-and-a-half-wide solar power plant – “the next generation in solar energy”, according to Kevin Smith, one of the project’s founders. The glass panes, which comprise a combined area of more than a million square metres, are not photovoltaic (PV) panels like those installed on rooftops and in solar farms worldwide. Instead, they are simply vast, multifaceted mirrors, which track the course of the sun like heliotropic plants. This field of mirrors harnesses and concentrates the blazing Nevada sunshine, directing it precisely towards the top of the central tower. “The difficulty with photovoltaic is that it’s intermittent,” says Smith, who is CEO of Crescent Dunes’s parent company, SolarReserve. “When the sun goes down, you’re done.” Engineers have long sought methods of storing solar energy – in water, in batteries, in fluid-filled “parabolic troughs” – but Smith claims that Crescent Dunes demonstrates “the world’s most advanced energy-storage technology”, known as molten-salt storage. The central tower secretes a reservoir of potassium and sodium nitrate – about 25,000 metric tonnes of it – heated in advance to 288°C, at which temperature the mixture is a clear, water-like liquid. This is circulated in narrow, thin-walled tubes, rising dramatically in temperature when exposed to the fearsome, concentrated sunlight at the top of the tower. “We heat it to 560°C,” says Smith, “it flows back down the tower and we capture it in a large tank.” The molten salt efficiently maintains the heat and when the energy is required, it is converted to electricity through a conventional steam turbine. This set-up allows Crescent Dunes to provide power to 75,000 Nevada homes long after the sun has set and even, if necessary, 24 hours a day.Smith believes that concentrated solar power (CSP) is not simply a substitute for photovoltaic panels but a potential competitor to conventional fuels. “It’s really an alternative to fossil fuel or even nuclear. You couldn’t power a city with just PV and wind, but you could with CSP, because of the storage capacity.” SolarReserve is already developing cheaper, higher-capacity installations and planning to build similar solar plants in South Africa, Chile and China. Of course, the technology isn’t flawless: CSP can only efficiently operate in areas with intense, uninterrupted sunlight and birds can be burned and killed by the concentrated sunbeams. Nonetheless, Crescent Dunes emits no pollutants, uses a fraction of the water required to generate coal or nuclear power and occupies a smaller combined area than, say, a coal-fired power station. Assuming the technology proves sustainable and replicable, among the ancient mountains of the American west, a bright future may be under way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/mar/31/rapid-decline-of-coal-use-leads-to-drop-in-uk-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-31T10:45:36Z","webTitle":"Rapid decline of coal use leads to drop in UK emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/31/rapid-decline-of-coal-use-leads-to-drop-in-uk-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/mar/31/rapid-decline-of-coal-use-leads-to-drop-in-uk-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Rapid decline of coal use leads to drop in UK emissions","bodyText":"Plummeting coal use in 2015 led to a fall of 4% in the UK’s annual carbon dioxide emissions, according to government energy statistics published on Thursday. Coal is now burning at its lowest level in at least 150 years. The closing of old polluting coal-power stations and the rapid rise in renewable energy meant coal consumption fell by 22% compared to 2014, the biggest drop ever seen outside of miners’ strikes, according to analysts at Carbon Brief. Production of coal in the UK also fell to a new record low, dropping by 27% due to mines closing. The rapid decline in coal use is continuing in 2016, with four more stations closed in the last fortnight, including Longannet, Ferrybridge and Eggborough, leaving six operational. The government has pledged to close all coal plants by 2025 to help meet climate change targets. The future of the large new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset is also in serious doubt, leading to concerns about energy security. But experts said coal plant closures would not lead to the lights going out. “We have seen at least five years of “lights out” headlines, so far without so much as a flicker caused by insufficient capacity,” said Prof Michael Grubb, at University College London. “Despite tight margins, extreme weather is far more likely to cause any household disconnections than insufficient generating capacity.” “Closure of these coal plants is both expected and necessary,” said Jonathan Gaventa, director of thinktank E3G. “The UK has plenty of options to cover the loss of coal-fired power through energy efficiency, renewables, interconnection with other countries and smart demand. This combination can deliver low-cost electricity reliably and quickly.” Renewable electricity generation surged in 2015, rising by 29%, allowing it to claim a record 25% share of all electricity. Most of this came from wind power and bioenergy, the latter being boosted by the continued conversion of Drax - once the UK’s biggest coal plant - to burning wood pellets. Solar power increased by 50% in 2015 to make up 9% of all renewable electricity. The government has been repeatedly criticised for cutting support for renewable energy and energy efficiency programmes. “If anything is to blame for tight margins, it’s previous governments’ history of incoherent energy policy,” said Paul Massara, former CEO of “big six” energy company RWE npower. “Investors need long-term clarity on policy, and they simply have not been getting it.” “Look outside the UK and it’s clear that the direction of travel in is only in one direction, towards primarily low-carbon, flexible, smart energy systems,” said Andrew Garrad, senior consultant at DNV GL energy. “It’s been accelerated by the Paris climate agreement, and Britain is by no means ahead of the pack in this transition.” The share of electricity generated by gas remained unchanged at 30% while nuclear’s share rose by two percentage points to 21%. The energy used by transport rose, which the government said was probably due to lower petrol prices. Oil production in the UK was 13% higher than in 2014 and gas production 8% higher, both bucking the trend of steady decline seen since the peaks seen in 1999 and 2000 respectively. The UK is the only G7 country increasing fossil fuel subsidies, according to a report in November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/jan/27/coal-power-plan-twice-the-cost-of-renewables-route-emissions-reduction","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-27T03:15:03Z","webTitle":"Australia's coal power plan twice as costly as renewables route, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/27/coal-power-plan-twice-the-cost-of-renewables-route-emissions-reduction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jan/27/coal-power-plan-twice-the-cost-of-renewables-route-emissions-reduction","fields":{"headline":"Australia's coal power plan twice as costly as renewables route, report finds","bodyText":"A plan for new coal power plants, which government ministers say could reduce emissions from coal-generated electricity by 27%, would cost more than $60bn, a new analysis has found. Achieving the same reduction using only renewable energy would cost just half as much – between $24bn and $34bn – the report found. The resources minister, Matthew Canavan, and the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, have been arguing for new coal power plants to be built in Australia. Last week, Canavan released analysis he commissioned from the industry department, which found replacing all Australia’s coal power stations with the latest “ultra super-critical” coal-fired power stations would reduce emissions in that sector by 27%. Frydenberg has also raised the conclusions in interviews, and promoted the benefits of coal power. Neither has responded to questions about the cost of reducing coal-fired power emissions by 27% using the latest technology. So Dylan McConnell from the Climate and Energy College at the University of Melbourne crunched the numbers, and found that the 27% reduction in the coal sector could be achieved, but it would cost $62bn. McConnell said at a conservative estimate, achieving the reduction would require 20GW of new capacity. According to the latest estimates from the CSIRO, new ultra super-critical black coal costs $3,100 per kW to build. “No wonder no one wants to talk about the costs,” McConnell said. He said $62bn would be enough to build between 35GW and 39GW of wind and solar energy. Because that would produce less electricity than 20GW of coal power, it would not completely replace coal power, but it would reduce its emissions by up to 65%. And that would amount to an emissions reduction of between 50% and 60% in the electricity sector as a whole. McConnell found that if the 27% reduction in emissions from the coal generation sector were to be achieved with renewables, rather than with new coal, about 13-19GW of renewable energy would be needed, which would cost between $24bn and $34bn. He said the scenario proposed by Canavan and Frydenberg would end up with 20GW of highly polluting coal power stations that were unlikely to be retired for decades. On the other hand, McConnell said, if that money were spent on renewables, it would leave some coal and gas in place, which ultimately would still need to be removed to meet long-term emissions reduction targets. Neither Canavan nor Frydenberg responded to questions about the costs of building new coal power stations. In a statement, Frydenberg said only that the government was committed to a “technology neutral” approach to meeting emissions targets. “Arbitrarily excluding certain technologies for ideological reasons will lead to higher cost outcomes,” the statement said. The Opposition spokesman for climate change and energy, Mark Butler, said: “This analysis clearly shows the government is off on an economically and environmentally irresponsible frolic with their trumpeting of ‘clean coal’. “As the Australian Industry Group and many others have made clear, replacing our existing coal power with more coal power just doesn’t stack up; either on environmental or economic grounds. “This is just the latest effort of a weak government to appease its irrational extreme right wing and distract from the fact they’re simply incapable of delivering real policy solutions to our significant energy challenges,” Butler said. McConnell pointed out that the latest coal-powered fire stations were not at all “clean”. They produced about 700 grams of CO2 for every kilowatt hour of electricity – much more than the 400 grams from new combined cycle gas turbines, and much more than the average produced by OECD countries, 420 grams per kilowatt hour in 2014, according to the International Energy Agency. OECD countries will need to reduce that figure to just 15 grams per kilowatt hour if the world is to keep global temperature increases below 2C, the agency has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/24/us-scientists-launch-worlds-biggest-solar-geoengineering-study","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-24T12:39:33Z","webTitle":"US scientists launch world's biggest solar geoengineering study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/24/us-scientists-launch-worlds-biggest-solar-geoengineering-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/24/us-scientists-launch-worlds-biggest-solar-geoengineering-study","fields":{"headline":"US scientists launch world's biggest solar geoengineering study","bodyText":"US scientists are set to send aerosol injections 20km up into the earth’s stratosphere in the world’s biggest solar geoengineering programme to date, to study the potential of a future tech-fix for global warming. The $20m (£16m) Harvard University project will launch within weeks and aims to establish whether the technology can safely simulate the atmospheric cooling effects of a volcanic eruption, if a last ditch bid to halt climate change is one day needed. Scientists hope to complete two small-scale dispersals of first water and then calcium carbonate particles by 2022. Future tests could involve seeding the sky with aluminium oxide – or even diamonds. “This is not the first or the only university study,” said Gernot Wagner, the project’s co-founder, “but it is most certainly the largest, and the most comprehensive.” Janos Pasztor, Ban Ki-moon’s assistant climate chief at the UN who now leads a geoengineering governance initiative, said that the Harvard scientists would only disperse minimal amounts of compounds in their tests, under strict university controls. “The real issue here is something much more challenging,” he said “What does moving experimentation from the lab into the atmosphere mean for the overall path towards eventual deployment?” Geoengineering advocates stress that any attempt at a solar tech fix is years away and should be viewed as a complement to – not a substitute for – aggressive emissions reductions action. But the Harvard team, in a promotional video for the project, suggest a redirection of one percent of current climate mitigation funds to geoengineering research, and argue that the planet could be covered with a solar shield for as little as $10bn a year. Some senior UN climate scientists view such developments with alarm, fearing a cash drain from proven mitigation technologies such as wind and solar energy, to ones carrying the potential for unintended disasters. Kevin Trenberth, a lead author for the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change, said that despair at sluggish climate action, and the rise of Donald Trump were feeding the current tech trend. “But solar geoengineering is not the answer,” he said. “Cutting incoming solar radiation affects the weather and hydrological cycle. It promotes drought. It destabilizes things and could cause wars. The side effects are many and our models are just not good enough to predict the outcomes” Natural alterations to the earth’s radiation balance can be short-lasting, but terrifying. A 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption lowered global temperatures by 0.5C, while the Mount Tambora eruption in 1815 triggered Europe’s ‘year without a summer’, bringing crop failure, famine and disease. A Met Office study in 2013 said that the dispersal of fine particles in the stratosphere could precipitate a calamitous drought across North Africa. Frank Keutsch, the Harvard atmospheric sciences professor leading the experiment, said that the deployment of a solar geoengineering system was “a terrifying prospect” that he hoped would never have to be considered. “At the same time, we should never choose ignorance over knowledge in a situation like this,” he said. “If you put heat into the stratosphere, it may change how much water gets transported from the troposphere to the stratosphere, and the question is how much are you [creating] a domino effect with all kinds of consequences? What we can do to quantify this is to start with lab studies and try to understand the relevant properties of these aerosols.” Stratospheric controlled perturbation experiments (SCoPEX) are seen as “critical” to this process and the first is planned to spray water molecules into the stratosphere to create a 1km long and 100m wide icy plume, which can be studied by a manoeuvrable flight balloon. If lab tests are positive, the experiment would then be replicated with a limestone compound which the researchers believe will neither absorb solar or terrestrial radiation, nor deplete the ozone layer. Bill Gates and other foundations are substantially funding the project, and aerospace companies are thought to be taking a business interest in the technology’s potential. The programmme’s launch will follow a major conference involving more than 100 scientists, which begins in Washington DC today. Solar geoengineering’s journey from the fringes of climate science to its mainstream will be sealed at a prestigious Gordon research conference in July, featuring senior figures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Oxford University. Pasztor says that most scientific observers now see the window to a 1.5C warmed world as “practically gone” and notes that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations will continue rising for many decades after the planet has reached a ‘net zero emissions’ point planned for mid-late century. But critics of solar radiation management approach this as a call to redouble mitigation efforts and guard against the elevation of a questionable Plan B. “It is appropriate that we spend money on solar geoengineering research,” said Kevin Anderson, the deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. “But we also have to aim for 2C with climate mitigation and act as though geoengineering doesn’t work, because it probably won’t.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/nov/24/hottest-year-ever-but-no-mention-of-climate-change-by-hammond","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-24T18:56:44Z","webTitle":"Hottest year ever – but no mention of climate change by Hammond | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/24/hottest-year-ever-but-no-mention-of-climate-change-by-hammond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/nov/24/hottest-year-ever-but-no-mention-of-climate-change-by-hammond","fields":{"headline":"Hottest year ever – but no mention of climate change by Hammond","bodyText":"It is staggering that in 2016, the hottest year on record, the chancellor can present a budget that has no mention of climate change (Report, 24 November). Indeed, most policies and spending plans are heading in the wrong direction.

The freeze on fuel duty is another backward step and shows that the government cares nothing about climate change, air pollution or public health. Last year saw a record number of vehicles on our roads, especially in rural areas where bus services have been decimated. The government could bring us healthier air and less congestion by raising fuel duty and using the money to reverse the devastating cuts to buses.

A carbon tax is gaining favour with governments and economists worldwide. Ironically, if – as it appears – a tax is not in our immediate future, other countries could slap one on our exports. Then we might reconsider a fee-and-dividend to improve our own economy, environment, and public health rather than pay someone else’s tax. In any case progress will come, as it already has, from states, local jurisdictions, and the private sector because reducing emissions makes economic sense. Washington can at most help, or at least stay out of the way. China has a major role in this drama. It has taken praiseworthy steps to reduce its carbon emissions. It is a leading exporter of wind turbines, and its technology has made solar energy affordable worldwide. Now it hopes to wrest the mantle of climate leadership from America. You want to compete with China, Mr Trump? Then compete to save the climate. Denying reality, trashing the environment, rushing headlong toward climate catastrophe, and withdrawing from the global community won’t make America great.

While the Palaszczuk government was determined to drive Queensland’s transformation from Australia’s biggest carbon polluter to a zero net emitter by 2050, it would rely for now on the economics of renewable energy and the “goodwill and leadership of industry” where national political leaders had failed, she said. Trad also said it would be “ridiculous” for the government to promise to stop the contentious Adani mine, given the company had stuck to legislative requirements and prevailed against a string of legal challenges. But she said Adani’s “whole future” was tied to what happened in India’s energy market, where solar power recently came in cheaper than coal-fired power. Speaking in the wake of meetings with Al Gore, who last week said it was “just nuts” to contemplate government funding for Adani’s mine infrastructure, Trad said the former US vice president turned climate action advocate had not broached the topic with her. “But we acknowledge that we need to work on transitioning our economy, and one of the things that we need to understand and know is that the global thermal coal markets will change, they will fluctuate, but they are on a general trajectory downwards in terms of relying on coal,” Trad told Guardian Australia. While there was “overwhelming support” in Queensland for climate action, there was also public demand for a “just transition” in the economy that took account of the importance of resource sector jobs. “This is an enormous challenge and Queensland does emit a lot of carbon emissions, carbon pollution,” Trad said. The state government has vowed to restore tree clearing protections if it wins the next election, something it could not do in minority government. Trad said this was “without a doubt” the least costly way of making deep cuts in Queensland’s carbon emissions, which accounted for 28.3% of the national total in 2015, more than any other state. “Yes, there will be people who don’t want to see their property rights reduced and they want to do what they want to do on their properties,” she said. “But the time is now for us to understand that there is a significant imperative that goes well beyond the boundary fence of any one property. “And quite frankly … a lot of the land clearing that’s happened has happened in Great Barrier Reef catchments [and] if we want to create a resilient reef we’ve got to reduce the amount of rubbish that is flowing into the reef.” Conservation groups welcomed the government’s 2050 zero net emissions target, announced last week as part of its climate change transition and adaptation strategies, but noted it was light on detail about how it would be achieved. Carbon cuts through tree clearing protections and a shift to 50% renewable energy by 2030 – the latter reducing total emissions by 30% – would account for less than half Queensland’s current carbon pollution. Tim Seelig of the Queensland Conservation Council said the government would have to start talking about winding down coal-fired generation or thermal coal mines within the next few years. “Ultimately, it’s hard to see how they can get there otherwise,” Seelig said. Trad said the 2030 target was an interim goal that the government’s advisory panel said did not require coal plant closures. “We haven’t talked about retiring any of our coal-fired fleet because ... Queensland’s fleet is actually quite young in terms of our power generation,” she said. It made sense in a national energy market for “the older, dirtier fleets to be retired and then work your way through and then the economy and the energy generation grid is changing, which it is doing at quite a rapid rate”. “But clearly [coal plant closures] will be an ongoing discussion in Queensland, in the national community and the local community, because we do know that in the global energy market, investment in renewable energy generation is skyrocketing.” A key takeout from her “inspirational and energising” encounters with Gore – during which Queensland signed up with other states to a “climate leadership declaration” – was his observation on “exponential” jobs growth in renewables in the US. “There is a trend happening and it is our obligation as a state government to make sure that we identify this trend because not only is it important for our planet in terms of keeping global temperatures below that 2C threshold, but also in terms of making sure that our economy transitions in a just way and we get the industry and the jobs,” she said. “That’s the sustainable economy that we need to prepare for. If we don’t prepare for it, we won’t get it.” Since the government set its clean energy target when coming to office, more than $2bn had been invested in large scale renewable energy, Trad said. Trad said in the absence of a national price signal on carbon, state governments trying to fill “a void” in political leadership were “relying on, number one, the economics of renewable energy, which is getting cheaper all the time”. “We’ve seen in places like India for example, the price of solar renewable energy generation dropped, significantly, below coal-fired generation power,” she said. “It’s that sort of economic imperative for industry, consumers and large scale corporations that are going to drive investment. “That’s what we’re relying on, that and the goodwill and leadership of industry to play a role where ... political leaders have failed. “I go to boardroom lunches and industry is preparing for it. They actually understand there is a significant trend happening globally and that if they don’t have a business plan and an idea about how they going to incorporate some sort of carbon price-type of solution, then they will be left short. “We know that Malcolm Turnbull is showing no leadership on this, that he is dithering in a deeply divided party room around action on climate change. “While he’s doing that, states and territories are getting on with the job of setting targets, working through plans, implementing policies that are actually going to make a difference.” The Palaszczuk government, in its attempts to contrast its environmental credentials with the Liberal National party opposition, has often come under criticism for its public support of Adani’s Carmichael mine. While Australia’s largest proposed thermal coal mine is a lightning rod for the conservation movement, which decries it as a “carbon bomb” to be exported to Asia, the Queensland government has been loath to stand in the way of a project promising almost 1,500 net jobs in a regional mining downturn. Trad said that “to be clear we never went to the election saying we were going to stop Adani – that would be ridiculous”. “But what we do know is that we need to find the resource sector jobs of the future. That’s what people want us to do.” But Trad said the contrast of Labor’s handling of the project with the former LNP government was obvious. “What Campbell Newman was going to do was give them $500m for their railway, and give them a royalty holiday, and dump 3m cubic metres of dredge spoil on the Great Barrier Reef. Asked whether the government could stop Adani if it wanted to, Trad said the company had “applied for mining licences under our legislation and it’s been appealed in several courts now and nothing’s been upheld”. “So that is what it is.” Trad said the “whole future of Adani is actually 100% leaning to what India does in terms of its energy generations of the future”. “The cost of solar energy in India actually came in at much less than coal-fired energy recently when they put out the auction. “That’s the stuff that’s happening because technology has improved. This is the stuff that’s going to change the global energy market.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/apr/04/denmark-josh-frydenberg-wind-energy-potential-qanda","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-03T21:03:12Z","webTitle":"We can't be Denmark: Josh Frydenberg plays down wind energy potential on Q&A","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/04/denmark-josh-frydenberg-wind-energy-potential-qanda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/apr/04/denmark-josh-frydenberg-wind-energy-potential-qanda","fields":{"headline":"We can't be Denmark: Josh Frydenberg plays down wind energy potential on Q&A","bodyText":"Josh Frydenberg has pointed to South Australia’s intermittent power issues as evidence that the rest of the country is not ready to transition out of fossil fuels, calling the state Australia’s “great experiment”. The minister for the environment and energy appeared alongside Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the chief executive of Save the Children International and the former prime minister of Denmark, on the Q&amp;A panel on Monday night. Denmark derives 57% of its electricity from renewable sources – 43% from wind. Asked whether Australia could reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, Frydenberg said the transition was under way. He said there was no shortage of wind or sun in Australia but its geographical remoteness meant it could not be connected to other countries in the way Denmark was. He said producing similar figures for wind for Australia was “probably not going to be when I’m the energy minister, but it will be in time very high levels of renewable penetration into the grid”. Frydenberg pointed to South Australia as evidence of how far renewable sources had to go before they could be relied upon. “They’ve been the big experiment, not just in Australia, but for much of the world. “One of the challenges they’ve faced is on one day wind has provided 100% of the power for SA and on another day 0%. That’s a level of intermittency which is very hard to deal with … so it’s an engineering challenge.” Thorning-Schmidt agreed that a “good mix” of energies was crucial for easing the transition to renewables, but said it took a “big, conscious effort” for Denmark to get to that stage. “If you think it through in a good way, it is possible. It does require investment. And often investment will require political will.” Labor’s human services spokeswoman, Linda Burney, agreed political will was lacking. She was scathing about the treasurer Scott Morrison’s coal stunt in parliament, calling it “one of the most ridiculous things” she had seen since becoming an MP. “It seems like it’s almost back to the future and coal is king again. And it was pure politics.” Paul Kelly, the editor-at-large of the Australian, said investors would be put off the renewables sector while opposing parties had such different policies on the issue. “We’ve got to make the transition in terms of emission reductions, according to our commitments under the Paris accords. We have to try and do it in a way that doesn’t do too much damage to the economy … and we’ve got to ensure the system doesn’t falter, that we don’t have the sort of blackouts which we’ve been having in South Australia.” But politicking and investment aside, Thorning-Schmidt argued, the transition had to happen because of the threat of climate change. “Climate change is actually real. It’s happening … We’re seeing unprecedented numbers of refugees as it is; we will have to add to that climate refugees. So I don’t think any of us can back out of this discussion. “This is a real issue and no one can solve this alone. But every country can play its part.” Asked by the host, Tony Jones, whether she was making an argument against coal, she replied: “Renewable energy is not coal.” Muhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi Nobel peace laureate and micro-financing pioneer, echoed Thorning-Schmidt when he said Australia’s transition from fossil fuels depended on “the strength of the commitment” to renewables. “That determines everything else. If you’re not quite sure how far we want to go, how quickly we want to go, then we’ll never get there. It has to be very clear this is what we’ll do: we’ll forget about fossil fuels and everything else.” Once the objective was clear, he said, the necessary technology would follow, pointing to the uptake of solar energy in Bangladesh. Yunus founded the grassroots Grameen Bank, which has 9 million borrowers, to combat poverty through micro-loans. He said growing inequality in wealth distribution was “a ticking time bomb”, linking it to Brexit in the UK and the election of Donald Trump in the US. “One per cent of the population of the whole world own 99% of the wealth of the entire world … That’s not sustainable society. You can’t watch people get everything on the top and everyone else is not getting anything. The feeling passes on to politics, passes on to society, and now our politics is blaming each other.” Thorning-Schmidt criticised Australia’s foreign aid contribution as inadequate in response to Frydenberg’s argument it was the 12th-highest of OECD countries. “I’m a foreigner and I shouldn’t be telling Australia what Australia should be doing,” she said. “I know how annoying it is when someone comes in and raises their finger. “The only thing I can say is when your development budget is at an all-time low, which it is right now, it feels like Australia is not taking its place in the world.” In response, Frydenberg accused the former foreign minister Kevin Rudd of acting with “ulterior motives” in directing Australia’s foreign aid towards Africa. He said the budget had not been reduced but “refocused” towards the Pacific. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, was committed to exploring partnerships with the private sector, he said. Frydenberg was invited to be a panellist at the last minute, after the cancellation of the anti-Islam activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s lecture tour of Australia. She cited a number of reasons, among them “organisational failures” by the Australian company behind the tour and “security concerns”. The energy minister said it was “very regrettable” that people had sought to prevent her from speaking in Australia, and linked her views to the debate about the 18C legislation: “I see her as the enemy of intolerance … I think we must protect and promote freedom of speech.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/27/better-election-results-ahead-for-the-green-party","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-27T20:05:25Z","webTitle":"Better election results ahead for the Green party? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/27/better-election-results-ahead-for-the-green-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/27/better-election-results-ahead-for-the-green-party","fields":{"headline":"Better election results ahead for the Green party?","bodyText":"Both John Curtice (Remain voters must now be Corbyn’s top priority, 25 February) and Jonathan Freedland (Copeland shows that Corbyn must go.

But Jeremy Corbyn has already blown that one with his tragically misguided three-line whip to crawl after the Tories in voting for article 50, even though most Labour voters backed Remain, as did most Greens and most Liberal Democrats. Labour’s last hope of avoiding electoral oblivion is to champion proportional representation, as Martin Childs says (Letters, 25 February). No one can really say what motivated a slim majority of voters to go for leave, but the most convincing argument that covers all possible shades of opinion is that people did not feel listened to. This isn’t necessarily the same as feeling “left behind”. I am not one of the left behind, but as a Green voter I am hugely underrepresented in parliament and my issues and concerns are routinely dismissed and ignored. I am definitely not listened to. Proportional representation would give a proper voice to me and to everyone else in the country who feels let down or marginalised. In fact, had we had PR in place prior to the referendum, it is almost certain that far fewer people would have felt motivated to give the government and/or the elite a kicking. Claire Lewis London • Reading John Curtice’s article confirms me in the belief that Labour’s electoral strategy appears to be “win Stoke and lose London”. In 2020 Labour remainers such as myself will have three unenviable options: either voting reluctantly for Labour, a party determined to ignore our views, despite us being in the majority among Labour voters; voting Green; or abstaining. Given Labour’s poor polling figures, it does seem a misguided strategy to alienate the majority of Labour voters. Derrick Joad Leeds • Re your editorial (Labour needs better answers to the questions voters are asking, 25 February), I would have expected better of the Guardian than to refer to “England’s four main parties (five if you count the Greens)”. The Green party is not the fifth party of British politics; it has been around since 1972, unlike Ukip, which only began in 1991 and which after Stoke and Copeland looks like it has had its day. Unlike Ukip, the Greens have an MP elected on a Green ticket rather than originally by defection from the Tories. Unlike the SNP or Plaid Cymru, the Greens cover the whole of the UK. In the 2016 London elections the Greens were the third party, on first- and second-preference votes, ahead of both the Lib Dems and Ukip. A major factor behind Sarah Olney’s Richmond Park victory was that she benefited from the Green vote, following an agreement to do politics differently and work in partnership for that particular vote. And, as the Guardian itself reported in January 2015, Green party membership was growing faster than that of the Lib Dems or Ukip. That growth has continued and, unlike Ukip, the Labour party or even the Tories, the Green party has a leadership that has its party behind it, with a coherent political vision, for a sustainable, fairer and greener society. Catherine Shelley Croydon and Sutton Green party • After a byelection, all I need is the result now and the result at the last election. I am capable of doing the sums of who is doing better or worse. As a Green councillor I am particularly interested if the Green vote is going up or down. The Guardian on 25 February was no help. Roger Stearn Old Newton, Suffolk • You used to give much more useful information in your byelection results: the votes cast and percentage for each candidate and the overall swing, plus the previous election figures for comparison. Why not revert to that approach rather than the fairly useless graphic which takes about the same amount of space while giving far less information. Joseph Webber Haywards Heath, West Sussex • Copeland voters are most worried about jobs; their main employer is the nuclear industry. They could see it had no future when a Chinese company stopped negotiations for a local buyout. That deal would have been bad for our energy bill payers because we would have had no control over pricing such electricity, but it was the last hope of a government that will not commit another penny to Sellafield. Labour’s mistake was ignoring the job opportunities to replace that industry such as wind and tidal power, solar energy, heat extraction and better use of methane. Also the thousands of long-term jobs needed to decommission such plants. The nuclear industry is paid for by taxation, but all that public money is only going in one direction, preventing “green economic growth”. Private investment follows public money into industry. Present policy stops such progress.

Narendra Modi told a press conference that as fossil fuels put the planet in peril, hopes for future prosperity in the developing world now rest on bold initiatives. “Solar technology is evolving, costs are coming down and grid connectivity is improving,” he said. “The dream of universal access to clean energy is becoming more real. This will be the foundation of the new economy of the new century.” Modi described the solar alliance as “the sunrise of new hope, not just for clean energy but for villages and homes still in darkness, for mornings and evening filled with a clear view of the glory of the sun”. Earlier, France’s climate change ambassador, Laurence Tubiana, had called the group “a true game-changer”. While signatory nations mostly hail from the tropics, several European countries are also on board with the initiative, including France. Hollande described the project as climate justice in action, mobilising public finance from richer states to help deliver universal energy access. “What we are putting in place is an avant garde of countries that believe in renewable energies,” he told a press conference in Paris. “What we are showing here is an illustration of the future Paris accord, as this initiative gives meaning to sharing technology and mobilising financial resources in an example of what we wish to do in the course of the climate conference.” The Indian government is investing an initial $30m (£20m) in setting up the alliance’s headquarters in India. The eventual goal is to raise $400m from membership fees, and international agencies. Companies involved in the project include Areva, Engie, Enel, HSBC France and Tata Steel. “It is very, very exciting to see India nailing its colours to the mast and providing leadership on this issue,” said James Watson, the director of SolarPower Europe, which represents the continents’ solar photovoltaic industry. “It will mean more opportunities for solar across the world and that can only be positive for combating climate change.” The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, placed the initiative in the context of the body’s sustainable development goals, particularly a related target, set in 2011, of achieving universal access to sustainable energy by 2030. India has repeatedly said that it wants to use cheap solar to connect citizens who are currently without access to the electricity grid in remote and rural areas. “The idea is that larger markets and bigger volumes will lead to lower costs, making it possible to spur demand,” said Ajay Mathur, India’s senior negotiator and spokesperson at the Paris summit. “This bold effort could bring affordable solar power to tropical villages and communities worldwide,” said Jennifer Morgan, the director of the World Research Institute’s climate programme. India’s pledge to the Paris summit offered to draw 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2030. The country is projected to be the world’s most populous by then, with 1.45 billion people. Climate Action Tracker described the promise as being “at the least ambitious end of what would be a fair contribution”, and not consistent with meeting a 2C target. But some see Modi as a clean energy enabler, having rapidly rolled out more than 900MW of solar energy across Gujarat when he was chief minister there. “India has emerged as the natural leader for this alliance, with its ambitious targets to install 175GW of renewable energy by 2022,” said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council for Energy, Environment and Water in India. Modi’s announcement on Monday comes hot on the heels of a pledge by the US and 18 other countries to provide $20bn for clean energy research by 2020, a doubling of current funding commitments. A separate Breakthrough Energy Coalition, which will act as an investment platform for clean energy projects, is also being launched on Monday by Bill Gates and the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg. On Sunday, Dubai announced a Dh100bn ($27bn) programme to make solar panels mandatory for all rooftop buildings by 2030, part of a plan to make the city a global clean energy centre. Dubai aims to generate 25% of its energy from clean sources by 2030, rising to 75% by 2050. The Indian initiative, called the International Agency for Solar Technologies and Applications (Iasta), aims to spread cheap solar technology across the globe with pooled policy knowledge. “We share a collective ambition to undertake innovative and concerted efforts aimed at reducing the costs of financing and urgent technological deployment for competitive solar facilities throughout our country,” a membership statement by the alliance says. It adds that the alliance will “pave the way for production technologies and storage of solar energy, adapted to the specific needs of our country”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/may/05/climate-change-innovations-fake-meat","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-05T07:00:33Z","webTitle":"Offshore wind, clever concrete and fake meat: the top climate change innovations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/05/climate-change-innovations-fake-meat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/may/05/climate-change-innovations-fake-meat","fields":{"headline":"Offshore wind, clever concrete and fake meat: the top climate change innovations","bodyText":"People in the US and beyond concerned about climate change may be alarmed at the Trump administration’s policies and attitudes – but there are plenty of businesses and innovators doing work at various scales. From solar to fake meat and low-carbon concrete, Oliver Milman explores some of the best examples of climate change-tackling innovations and innovators. Community solar Large-scale solar is a booming industry in the US, with the sector now employing twice the number of people involved with coal mining. But the decarbonization of America’s energy system is happening at a more local level, too. There are 25 states with at least one community solar project online, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, and 2016 was a bumper year, with 218 MW added. “It’s picking up speed, and there’s a lot in the pipeline, so it’ll be a mainstream driver of solar in the future,” said Alex Hobson, a spokeswoman for the association. “There is room to grow and there’s a lot of interest from people who never thought about solar, such as those renting or who are moving out of their buildings in the near future.” Community solar works by allowing several people, such as those in a building with several apartments, to derive energy from a solar project installed on their building or elsewhere. Some utilities provide customers the ability to purchase the renewable energy from a shared facility, while in other cases groups of people band together to take advantage of state and federal incentives to make the investment themselves. California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Minnesota are currently leading the way. Vegetarian meat Agricultural activities currently contribute about 10% of America’s total greenhouse gas emissions each year, largely due to the methane expelled by cattle. Americans are eating less beef than they did a decade ago, but further reductions would be handy if the US is to reduce its emissions to levels that would help avoid dangerous climate change. A raft of new meatless meat options have been made available for those who are reluctant about going vegetarian but can’t quite stomach the impact of meat production. The Impossible Burger, a fake meat offering, has gained plenty of headlines due to the fact it “bleeds” much like the real thing. The $12 burger, backed by investors including Bill Gates and Google, has confused some diners but it’s hoped it will help make people cut down on beef, saving land, water and emissions in the process. There is plenty of competition, too, from brands such as Beyond Meat, Gardein and the venerable Tofurky. Low-carbon concrete Worldwide use of concrete is soaring, largely due to a building boom in China and, to a lesser extent, India. In fact, China has used more cement since 2011 than the US did during the entire 20th century. The greenhouse gas emissions in its production are significant, prompting researchers to come up with a greener alternative. In February, Rutgers University’s Richard Riman announced a new technology that can make a variety of materials, including concrete. Combined with cement, the product can reduce the carbon footprint of cement and concrete by up to 70%, according to the university. “I looked at how shellfish make ceramics at low-temperature, like carbonate crystals, and then looked at what people can do with water to make landing strips in Alaska, and I said we should be able to do this with ceramics, but use a low-temperature chemical process that involves water,” Riman said. “When you can develop technologies that are safe and easy to use, it’s a game-changer.” Lawn treatments A technology company called WISErg has developed a product called the Harvester, which transforms food waste into fertilizer than can be applied to lawns. The product, launched in 2014, has helped the company get more than $30m in investment. In the same area, a startup in Connecticut is working on replacing gasoline-run mowers with a solar-charged alternative that, for each lawn, saves emissions equivalent to those of a car on the road for 12,000 miles. Offshore wind Wind currently supplies around 5% of America’s electricity but the sector is on the up thanks to the introduction of offshore wind farms. In December, the first US offshore wind turbines started turning near a small island off the coast of Rhode Island. The Block Island wind farm is small – capable of powering about 17,000 homes – but has opened up the way for further developments along the coast. Donald Trump isn’t a fan – he has fought a losing battle to prevent a wind farm near one of his golf courses in Scotland – but the falling cost of turbines is making offshore wind more competitive. Maryland is currently mulling two different proposals for offshore wind which would dwarf the Block Island development. Electric cars Electric vehicle sales jumped 70% in 2016, following a disappointing previous year, with more than 30 different models on sale by the end of the year. Tesla, Chevrolet, Nissan and Ford lead the way, with more than half of sales occurring in California, which mandates a certain slice of auto sales must be electric. Continued growth could depend on whether a federal tax credit is extended but the electric vehicle market is maturing from a niche oddity to a competitive international field. The Chinese government is calling on auto manufacturers to sell more electric vehicles to improve air quality, with Ford announcing it will electrify 70% of the vehicles sold in the country by 2025. There’s still a long way to go – many drivers still worry about the availability of recharging stations – but this is yet another clean energy market that America could lead in. Geoengineering Even the sober assessment of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) leaves much to guesswork when it comes to meeting emissions reduction goals. If the world is to avoid 2C or more of warming, as-yet undeveloped technology will need to be used to extract carbon dioxide from the air at some point, due to the patchy progress in cutting emissions. One desperate intervention could be solar engineering, which is being studied by a team led by David Keith at Harvard University. The researchers are looking at how chemical compounds, such as limestone dust, can be dispersed in the atmosphere, thereby scattering sunlight and sparing an area below from its heat. How this can be achieved, and whether it is even desirable to do so, is an ongoing debate. But if we continue to cook our planet, then governments may have to turn to the likes of Keith to help avert the worst."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2015/jan/29/investors-lose-millions-bond-company-administration","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-29T17:56:52Z","webTitle":"Investors could lose millions as solar energy bond company goes into administration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/29/investors-lose-millions-bond-company-administration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2015/jan/29/investors-lose-millions-bond-company-administration","fields":{"headline":"Investors could lose millions as solar energy bond company goes into administration","bodyText":"Nearly 1,000 small investors who put a total of £7.5m into “secured” energy bonds which promised to pay an income of 6.5% a year are unlikely to see a penny of their money back after it emerged the cash was siphoned off to an Australian company that later went bust. Secured Energy Bonds were launched in November 2013, with the lure that they were an “environmentally friendly and locally sensitive way” to invest. Buyers were told the money would be used to install solar panels on schools across the UK. But panels were installed at only six schools of the initial 22 schools planned, as the money raised from investors went instead to shore up the worsening financial situation at the parent company, CBD Energy. Accountants Grant Thornton, administrators to CBD Energy, said: “During financial year 2014 CBD used funds of a subsidiary company, Secured Energy Bonds plc, in contravention of the purpose of these funds, to meet the group’s cashflow shortfalls.” CBD Energy is an Australian firm controlled by controversial entrepreneur Gerry McGowan, who set up the country’s first budget airline, Impulse Airlines. He later sold it to Qantas, which used it as the basis for Jetstar. But in October last year McGowan took a leave of absence while the board investigated if the accounts needed restating. Then in November, CBD Energy went into administration. In the same month McGowan sold his Double Bay, Sydney penthouse apartment for a price understood to be above AUS$7m (£3.6m). Grant Thornton said CBD was effectively insolvent from June 2014, and could not meet its liabilities as early as June 2013. Yet British investors were being told throughout this period to “Make an ethical, more secured investment in renewable energy and enjoy the financial rewards.” Investors only learned of the company’s failure when a quarterly interest payment, due on Monday this week, was missed. The investors have no rights to compensation as the bonds are treated the same as shares, and are not covered by the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Hopes that there will be any assets to be recovered are dwindling. At the bond’s launch, its promoters said investors would “enjoy a level of security not previously associated with this type of bond”, as the income was secured against “the solar projects, their income flow and the company’s cash reserves. CBD will also give a corporate guarantee”. A London firm called Independent Portfolio Managers (IPM), regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, was appointed as the “security trustee” responsible for safeguarding the interests of bondholders in the event of default. It issued a statement that it only became aware of problems in November 2014, and is now seeking to put Secured Energy Bonds into administration. “The timing and amount of payments are, at this stage, uncertain,” it said. However in Australia, Grant Thornton said “the investment is likely to be substantially impaired”. The failure of Secured Energy Bonds is the first major test of the “retail bond” market that has exploded in popularity in recent years. With interest rates at rock-bottom lows, companies as diverse as Tesco Bank and the Jockey Club have issued bonds paying interest of 5% or more to investors desperate for higher income. SEB was structured as a “mini-bond” that could not be traded. Critics warned that investors were buying without sufficiently examining the risk of defaults. Trillion Fund, a popular crowdfunding platform for renewable energy projects, acted as a lead generator for Secured Energy Bonds, and its failure was “deeply disappointing”. It added that it no longer promotes mini-bonds. In October 2013, city regulators announced a clampdown on aspects of the retail bond industry, saying that they should only be marketed to “sophisticated investors” or to clients of FCA-authorised advisers and managers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2016/oct/20/onshore-windfarms-more-popular-than-thought-uk-poll-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-20T06:00:29Z","webTitle":"Onshore windfarms more popular than thought, UK poll finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/20/onshore-windfarms-more-popular-than-thought-uk-poll-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/oct/20/onshore-windfarms-more-popular-than-thought-uk-poll-finds","fields":{"headline":"Onshore windfarms more popular than thought, UK poll finds","bodyText":"Public support for onshore windfarms is far higher than widely believed, according to a new opinion poll, even in rural areas. Wind turbines are also far more popular than fracking or nuclear power, contrasting with the UK government’s decision to block onshore windfarms but back shale gas exploration and new nuclear power plants. The ComRes poll, conducted for climate change charity 10:10, found that 73% of the British public supported onshore windfarms, with just 17% opposed, and the rest not sure. Strong support remained even when only considering the views of those from rural areas, who might live near windfarms: 65% support versus 25% against. However, when people were asked what level of support they thought windfarms had across the country, just one in 10 said it was more than 70%. The average level of support estimated by people was just 42%, far below the true figure. Research for 10:10 conducted by Imperial College London showed that more than two-thirds of newspaper comment and editorial articles in the last five years were negative overall about windfarms. “The UK public love wind power and they don’t even realise,” said Max Wakefield, at 10:10, which launched its Blown Away campaign on Thursday. “It’s plainly not true onshore wind is unpopular with the UK public. It’s time our politicians caught up. Onshore wind is already the cheapest tool we have to achieve energy independence, keep bills under control and tackle climate change.” The government’s own polling has consistently shown that renewable energy has 75-80% public support. But the Conservative victory in 2015, with 37% of the vote, has all but ended onshore windfarm developments, fulfilling a manifesto pledge to do so. The new poll showed even stronger public support for solar energy - 83% for and 8% against - but ministers have slashed solar subsidies. Fracking was supported by 34% and opposed by 45% in the poll. Ministers overruled Lancashire council earlier in October to grant permission for shale gas exploration, leading to accusations of double standards, as local communities have the final say over windfarm applications. Nuclear power was supported by 46% in the new poll and opposed by 37%. In September, the prime minister, Theresa May, gave the go-ahead for a new heavily subsidised nuclear plant at Hinkley in Somerset. Offshore windfarms, which are supported by ministers, are also popular with the public, with 80% supporting and 10% opposing. The ComRes poll interviewed 2,037 British adults online on 12-13 October 2016 and data were weighted to be representative of all British adults."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/29/strong-parliament-will-be-natures-last-line-of-defence-during-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-29T08:30:00Z","webTitle":"A strong parliament will be nature’s last line of defence during Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/29/strong-parliament-will-be-natures-last-line-of-defence-during-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/29/strong-parliament-will-be-natures-last-line-of-defence-during-brexit","fields":{"headline":"A strong parliament will be nature’s last line of defence during Brexit","bodyText":"When Theresa May fires the Brexit starting gun by triggering article 50, she will start a process that could dramatically reshape almost every aspect of British life – from our economy, laws, and place in the world to our natural environment. The difficult choices our politicians make in just a few years could change the face of Britain for generations to come. Even before the tough bargaining with the EU and other countries start in earnest, another, more domestic negotiation process will get underway – the constitutional power struggle between parliament and government over who will have the final say on the momentous Brexit decisions. A lot will ride on the outcome of this tug of war, and that includes the fate of many vital environmental safeguards we take for granted. Over four decades of EU membership, Britain has acquired one of the most formidable bodies of environmental law in the world. Whether it’s air pollution, water quality, or toxic chemicals, many of the environmental safeguards protecting our health and our environment are rooted in EU law. It is EU law that has chivvied a recalcitrant government into cleaning up our beaches, improving recycling rates, and banning bee-harming pesticides. The habitats and birds directives have provided stronger protection for threatened wildlife than any UK law. And it is the EU air quality laws that have allowed campaigners to hold ministers to account for their failure to tackle air pollution in the courts. All these vital protections – the fruits of decades of negotiations, campaigning, and political work – are about to come under an unprecedented amount of pressure. Along with thousands of other EU laws, ministers say that most environmental legislation will be transposed en bloc into domestic law by the “great repeal bill”. Although this might sound like an unalloyed piece of good news, it isn’t. Ministers have already warned that only two-thirds of environmental regulations can be adopted as they are, leaving the remaining third in dangerous limbo. But even the laws that are directly transferred will be put on much shakier ground. The institutions that guarantee their enforcement, such as the European court of justice and the commission, will have no jurisdiction in Britain. So who will hold the government to account? No 10 sources have suggested Theresa May favours the option of the UK remaining a member of EU regulatory agencies, but what powers these watchdogs will retain and what laws they will be able to enforce is not clear. An even greater and more immediate danger lurks in the great repeal bill. Ministers have been talking about including a so-called Henry VIII clause in the bill that would give them the power to change primary legislation without a vote in parliament. In this scenario, an all-powerful executive will be able to cherry-pick which environmental legislation they want to keep while ditching the rest with a stroke of the pen. The vital laws protecting our health and our environment from air pollution, noxious chemicals, and destructive industries will be left hostage to the whims of the government and business lobbies of the day. Clues to how these powers may be used already abound. Michael Gove has openly called for the habitat directive to be scrapped. The environment minister George Eustice is on record describing it as “spirit-crushing”. And a leading Brexiter like Jacob Rees-Mogg has argued Britain could slash environmental and safety regulations on imported products, adopting, for example, emissions standards that are “good enough for India”. Industry lobbies on both sides of the Atlantic have already sniffed an opportunity to do away with regulations that put consumers before corporate profits. A US farming lobbyist recently told Radio 4’s Today programme that any US-UK trade deal would be dependent on Britain allowing imports of US foods that have so far been banned, from chlorine-washed chicken to hormone-infused beef. Leading car makers in the US have already lobbied Trump for weaker fuel economy standards and got what they wanted. It’s hard to see why they wouldn’t attempt to do the same in Britain once the backstop of EU air quality rules has fallen away. Closer to home, the owner of British Gas, Centrica, has urged the government to drop EU targets on renewable energy unless they can be used as a bargaining chip during Brexit negotiations. Since any deployment of wind and solar energy by communities and individual households is a threat to the big six’s stranglehold, Centrica is exploiting Brexit to pull a fast one on the competition and, ultimately, on consumers too. This is just the beginning. The deeper we wade into the quagmire of Brexit negotiations, the more pressure industry lobbies are going to put on our politicians to sacrifice crucial environmental safeguards on the altar of low-standard trade deals. This is why our elected representatives have a crucial role to play in defending the values Britain holds dear. A majority of people have voted for Brexit, but they didn’t vote for a more polluted or less green Britain. This government has no mandate to tamper with the environmental safeguards protecting our parks, our beaches, and our air. If the vague promise about “taking back control” is to be at least partially fulfilled, the crucial decisions about the future of our environment cannot be made over a handshake between ministers and corporate lobbyists. Any changes to this vital legislation must be done in a democratic way – through a parliamentary vote and the thorough public scrutiny that accompanies it. A truly sovereign parliament during Brexit will be the last line of defence for our green and pleasant land."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/apr/14/toshiba-us-nuclear-problems-uk-cautionary-tale","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-14T07:00:27Z","webTitle":"Toshiba's US nuclear problems could provide cautionary tale for UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/14/toshiba-us-nuclear-problems-uk-cautionary-tale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/apr/14/toshiba-us-nuclear-problems-uk-cautionary-tale","fields":{"headline":"Toshiba's US nuclear problems provide cautionary tale for UK","bodyText":"The roots of Toshiba’s admission this week that it has serious doubts over its “ability to continue as a going concern” can be found near two small US towns. It is the four reactors being built for nuclear power stations outside Waynesboro, in Georgia, and Jenkinsville, South Carolina, by the company’s US subsidiary Westinghouse that have left the Japanese corporation facing an annual loss of £7.37bn. Construction work on the units has run hugely over budget and over schedule, casting a shadow over two of the biggest new nuclear power station projects in the US for years. Events came to a head last month when Westinghouse was forced to file for bankruptcy protection to limit Toshiba’s losses. Westinghouse’s problems in Waynesboro and Jenkinsville could provide a cautionary tale for the UK, which is also embarking on a nuclear power station-building programme. Experts said the delays and cost problems were due to America’s lack of recent experience in building atomic power plants. “I don’t think it is necessarily because of an inherent issue of US skills but rather the lack of practice,” said Richard Nephew, a professor at the Centre on Global Energy Policy, Columbia University. “There simply have not been as many new reactor builds in the US and this has reduced the overall pool of skilled labor, no question.” The absence of a mass production supply chain, due to the small number of the Westinghouse-designed reactors being built, played a part too, he added. Regulatory issues had also delayed construction. Toshiba’s losses stem from Westinghouse’s acquisition in 2015 of the nuclear construction business CB&amp;I Stone &amp; Webster, which it hoped would solve the delays on the two sites. That deal has now backfired spectacularly, pushing Westinghouse and its parent company to the brink of financial collapse. The regulator for one of the projects, Plant Vogtle, in Georgia, has said Westinghouse’s bankruptcy means the project will require more “time and money”. Meanwhile the utility company paying for the Virgil C Summer Nuclear Generating Station, near Jenkinsville, South Carolina, warned this week that abandonment of the project was one of the options it was now considering. Nephew said: “This experience may push the US into a different model, perhaps focused on smaller modular reactors, or less complicated designs.” The US energy secretary, Rick Perry, signalled the Trump administration’s support for nuclear this week, issuing a statement at the G7 summit in which he said the US backed “advanced civil-nuclear technologies”. That suggested support for next-generation reactors rather than the sort being built by Westinghouse. Richard Morningstar, chairman of the Global Energy Centre at the international affairs thinktank Atlantic Council, said: “What is happening to Westinghouse and Toshiba only emphasises the need to double down on research on new, safe, nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors. If we do not do so in the US, leadership will be ceded to other countries.” One such aspiring atomic leader is the UK, where the government wants to build a new generation of nuclear power stations to help satisfy the country’s power needs for decades to come. But there are obvious parallels between the two countries on the issues of recent experience and supply chains. The UK has not completed a new nuclear power station since Sizewell B on the Suffolk coast started generating power in 1995. EDF, the French state-owned company which has started pouring concrete at Hinkley Point in Somerset, where it plans to have two reactors operational by 2025, maintains it has had plenty of recent practice. The EPR reactor design for Hinkley is the same as that for the reactors it is building in Finland, and at Flamanville, in France, though both of those are running late and over budget. The other new nuclear projects proposed around the UK, all by foreign companies, look less certain and all are still years from construction starting in earnest. Toshiba said this week it would consider selling its shares in the consortium behind another plant planned at Moorside, in Cumbria, which would utilise three of the same AP1000 Westinghouse reactors being built for the two crisis-hit US plants. The South Korean power company Kepco last month expressed an interest in buying into the project, and the business secretary , Greg Clark, went to South Korea last week for talks on collaboration on nuclear power. However, any rescue by Seoul is far from certain. The two leading candidates in South Korea’s elections in May said this week that they favoured rowing back on nuclear power and switching to renewable energy. Kepco would also face a regulatory delay of several years if it wanted to use its own technology at Moorside. Unions in the UK said the uncertainty showed that the government should intervene more directly, by taking a stake in Moorside. Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary, said: “The big moral of the story is what on earth we are doing as a country, leaving our fundamental energy requirements to foreign companies or foreign governments?” While the government has argued that it has plans in place to keep the lights on if new nuclear projects do not materialise, others said the deepening crisis at Toshiba this week showed the need for ministers to consider a new energy policy. “It’s time to come up with a new plan A,” said Paul Dorfman, of the Energy Institute, at University College London, who believes the Moorside project is dead. “It’s time for a viable strategy that talks about grid upgrades, solar, energy efficiency, and energy management.” A report published on Thursday highlighted another alternative: a U-turn on the Conservative party’s manifesto commitment to block new onshore windfarms. Analysis for the trade body Scottish Renewables suggested wind turbines on land had become so cheap they could be built for little or no subsidy, compared to the lucrative contract awarded to EDF for Hinkley. But the prospect of a rethink by the government on wind power looks about as likely as new nuclear power stations being built on time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/dec/26/australias-answer-to-tesla-indigenous-firm-allgrid-shines-in-solar-battery-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-26T00:44:30Z","webTitle":"Australia's answer to Tesla: Indigenous firm AllGrid shines in solar battery industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/26/australias-answer-to-tesla-indigenous-firm-allgrid-shines-in-solar-battery-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/dec/26/australias-answer-to-tesla-indigenous-firm-allgrid-shines-in-solar-battery-industry","fields":{"headline":"Australia's answer to Tesla: Indigenous firm AllGrid shines in solar battery industry","bodyText":"AllGrid Energy, an Indigenous-owned company has emerged as a hopeful minnow beside corporate giants poised to drive the expansion of Australia’s fledgling home solar battery industry. The Brisbane-based upstart looks forward to the looming entry of the global industry’s marquee player, Tesla, as a shot in the arm to the Australian market. While orders for Tesla’s Powerwall have officially begun in Australia amid a reported spike in customer queries – driven by interest in the electric carmaker’s brand – AllGrid Energy is already delivering its system to customers in South Australia and Queensland. The company claims its 10 kilowatt-hour GridWatt system at $12,000 is up to 30% cheaper than the Powerwall. The GridWatt is cheaper because it features older tubular lead acid gel batteries in an aluminium cabinet that must be installed outside a home, as opposed to Tesla’s smaller, indoors package based on lithium batteries. But AllGrid’s marketing manager, Deborah Oberon, said the company hoped its “cost-effective” offering would encourage take-up, particularly in the remote Indigenous communities where its parent company operates. The company’s chief executive and majority shareholder, Raymond Pratt, is a Darwin-based Indigenous man who parlayed his trade ticket as an electrician into founding the electrical and construction services outfit Dice Australia. A key opportunity for AllGrid beckons in remote Indigenous communities which rely on costly and emissions-heavy diesel generators. “Obviously as an Indigenous company working with Indigenous communities, it’s a really big area of traction for us,” Oberon said. The end result of these “commercial scale” solar systems would be “energy wealth and energy autonomy” for those remote communities. AllGrid has a number of feasibility studies under way for Indigenous communities both on and off the national power grid, Oberon says, with plans to train local Indigenous electricians to install those systems. Tesla and AllGrid are among a broad field of players looking to capitalise on a promising market for solar batteries in Australia, where per capita take-up of rooftop solar panels leads the world. Energy storage systems give households with solar power the opportunity to further cut reliance on the nation’s largely coal-fired electricity grid, even during peak demand times when the sun has gone down. AllGrid claims its storage systems, which are assembled at a factory in Brisbane’s south, can cut household grid power consumption by 75%. Oberon said that although orders were “ticking along” thanks to the interest of early adopters, 2016 would be “the year that storage really starts to kick off in Australia”. “Once Tesla’s system is available in February, that will be the moment the game really starts to change,” she said. “With the coverage and publicity that a company like Tesla get, we’re really confident the market will heat up.” In the new year, the company was also slated to build a solar power storage system for a student housing and crisis accommodation group in Sydney, which earned an innovation grant through the city council this month to fund it. “Students are a demographic that typically experience energy stress and energy poverty so once again our clients’ commitment to community means we’re really looking for models where people who are in those kind of situations, we can advantage them through the types of systems that we supply and the types of funding models we use to get those in place,” Oberon said. Oberon said the company was about to strike a deal with an unnamed electricity retailer to offer an increased “feed in” tariff – or the price paid for surplus power fed back into the grid – a key incentive for solar panel owners who missed out on the generous rates offered to early adopters in previous years. Bendigo Bank also offers relatively cheap finance at 6.7% a year for customers buying the systems, and they can also roll that over into their mortgages. The WattGrid is being sold for about $12,000, about $3,000 less than a comparable set-up being advertised for the Powerwall. AllGrid has also released a solar energy system, the PortaGrid, for remote locations where tapping into the national power grid is not an option. It comes with the option of a weather monitor that automatically closes up the solar panels in severe weather events like cyclones. Oberon said the company was talking to the national parks and wildlife service about using the PortaGrid to replace diesel generators in remote sites. Oberon said the technology, developed with AllGrid’s second parent company, the renewable energy company Consolidated Industrial Holdings, could be particularly attractive in developing countries. AllGrid also has its sights on developing storage systems with saltwater batteries that it says could last twice as long as lead acid batteries. Oberon said the current AllGrid systems were designed so that the tubular gel batteries could be “easily swapped” with more advanced batteries at the end of their life."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"business/2017/jan/21/batteries-included-yorkshire-village-seeks-to-solve-riddle-of-too-much-sun","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-21T08:00:30Z","webTitle":"Batteries included: Yorkshire village seeks to solve riddle of too much sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/21/batteries-included-yorkshire-village-seeks-to-solve-riddle-of-too-much-sun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/jan/21/batteries-included-yorkshire-village-seeks-to-solve-riddle-of-too-much-sun","fields":{"headline":"Batteries included: Yorkshire village seeks to solve riddle of too much sun","bodyText":"The bungalows of Oxspring may look an unlikely testing ground for a new technology billed as a way to help renewable power, stymie energy price rises and aid the local power grid. But later this month, dozens of homes in this South Yorkshire village will have a home battery installed as part of a £250,000 trial to see if they can make solar power more valuable to homeowners and less painful for grid managers. Smaller than the high-profile Powerwalls introduced to the UK by Elon Musk’s Tesla last year, the British-engineered batteries will be fitted for free in 30 homes with solar panels on their roofs and 10 without. The project is a response to what until recently would have seemed an improbable challenge for the UK: too much solar power. There are now 875,000 homes with solar photovoltaic panels, and that is beginning to pose issues for network operators. In Oxspring, a community energy company found it could only install solar panels at two in three homes because of constraints on the amount of power that can be pushed into the grid. Energy storage company Moixa and the local network operator, Northern Powergrid, hope their pilot will “timeshift” solar for use at peak times and show storage can reduce network bottlenecks and cut out the need for costly upgrades, which would be passed on to energy bill-payers. “In northern Europe, solar produces the most energy when you don’t need it [at midday]. The amount of solar in the UK is meaningful now, and that’s translating to challenges [to grids] and costs to customers,” said Simon Daniel, chief executive of Moixa, who sees better storage as the solution. The company has around 600 batteries in homes across the UK, which it aggregates to act like one big battery, effectively a virtual power station. The Oxspring householders will either benefit from using more of their solar power – the electricity is more valuable if consumed in the house rather than exported to the grid – while the non-solar homes will get a cheque of £50-£75 each year from Moixa for aiding the local network. The trial near Barnsley is just one sign of a growing energy storage market in Britain. Companies such as Tesla and London-based Powervault do not publish sales numbers, but Germany’s Sonnen says it has sold hundreds of storage systems in the UK. The total installed is thought to be in the four figures. Most players have so far targeted householders hoping to increase the financial gain from their solar panels. But the introduction of time-of-day energy tariffs, enabled by smart meters, mean householders could potentially store electricity when it’s cheap, for use later when it’s pricier. Combined with the advent of rebates for “grid services” to connected batteries such as the Oxspring ones, they could dramatically widen home batteries’ appeal. Industry group the Electricity Storage Network describes 2017 as a “watershed” year for the technology. Sonnen said it was receiving a surge of customer enquiries, and predicted the UK market would take off this year. Powervault, which says it wants to make home batteries as commonplace as dishwashers and washing machines, started a £625,000 trial in south-east England last month. The project with UK Power Networks involves batteries in 60 homes. “The purpose is to enable us to harness more of the solar energy that’s generated during the day, when demand for energy is low, and release it onto the network at the morning and evening peaks,” said a spokesman for UK Power Networks, the UK’s biggest network operator. “National Grid spends about £1bn a year balancing demand and supply of energy. Currently they pay that money largely to big power stations but in the future we’ll move to a scenario where it also goes to a collective of batteries,” said Joe Warren, MD of Powervault, which began selling home batteries in 2014. He said Tesla’s arrival last year raised consumer awareness and argued that the market is big enough to sustain several companies: “There’s definitely room for a British energy storage player.” However, its US rival is upping the ante with a new, higher capacity version of its battery, which is in such demand that anyone buying one today can only get it in March at the earliest. Tesla, which earlier this month switched on the first sections of its battery-making Gigafactory in Nevada, begins installing the first of the new generation of Powerwall 2s in UK homes in February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/dec/08/britain-climate-change-green-economy-david-cameron-paris","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-08T18:09:46Z","webTitle":"Britain can’t preach on climate change while it dismantles its green economy | John Ashton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/08/britain-climate-change-green-economy-david-cameron-paris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/08/britain-climate-change-green-economy-david-cameron-paris","fields":{"headline":"Britain can’t preach on climate change while it dismantles its green economy","bodyText":"Rule one of diplomacy is, walk your talk: otherwise people stop listening. In Paris last week David Cameron called for “action today”, not excuses tomorrow, on climate change. Back home, his ministers are already making excuses for what looks increasingly like a systematic repudiation of 10 years of successful action to build a prosperous low-carbon economy in Britain. The Green MP Caroline Lucas is right to have called this a “spectacular display of cognitive dissonance”. Not surprisingly, the world is beginning to notice. “On eve of Paris climate summit, Britain pulls plug on renewables”, read a recent headline in the Washington Post. The job of government on climate change is to ensure attractive and stable conditions for investment in the low-carbon transition. In recent months our government has hit the brakes on onshore wind and solar energy, on energy efficiency and on community renewable schemes. Its plan to sell off the Green Investment Bank will destroy a crucial financing mechanism. Its trashing of a 10-year effort to make the UK a leader in carbon capture and storage blew away more than £100m in imminent investment from China. Its surreptitious edging away from its 2020 renewables target casts doubt on all its climate promises. Meanwhile our energy secretary, Amber Rudd, has invited a new dash for gas. If implemented at the scale apparently intended, this will kill the Climate Change Act by steadily undermining our capacity to stick to its legally binding carbon pathway. The government’s unnecessary and undeliverable obsessions with disruptive fracking and expensive nuclear energy will further chill investment in renewables and energy efficiency. And as camouflage for her boss in Paris, Rudd has claimed credit for a phase-out of coal that her predecessors had already made inevitable. Our government claims to want coherent policies. So why did it slap a carbon tax, the climate change levy, on carbon-neutral renewable energy? Our government claims to want value for money. So why is it signing up for a nuclear power plant that will make our electricity needlessly expensive for 20 years while putting obstacles in the path of onshore wind, the cheapest form of carbon-neutral energy? Our government claims to want local people to decide on local infrastructure. So why is it desperate to force fracking on unwilling communities while obstructing the renewables schemes they desire? Recent dismay from the Scottish government is a warning that these policies may sow new divisions between London and Edinburgh. Scotland needs more, not less, ambition nationally to realise the potential of its abundant renewable energy resources and escape from its unhealthy dependence on North Sea oil and gas. Privatisation of the Green Investment Bank will weaken the attraction of Edinburgh, where it is based, as a centre for low-carbon finance. When our leaders speak, we should not only listen to what they say but read their lips. Reading the lips of Rudd and the chancellor, George Osborne, it is hard to escape the conclusion that these incoherent, unconvincing policies seem driven more by ideology and casual expediency than by a serious assessment of what Britain needs. Any incoming government is entitled to make changes. There were gaps and contradictions in the energy and climate policies this government inherited. But in its response there is little sign of real intent to make sure that our country does at home what our prime minister has just urged on the rest of the world. Every step it has taken has been a step backwards. Conditions for investment are now less attractive and less stable. That imposes extra risks on investors – risks consumers will be asked to pay for. That is, of course, on top of the growing risks to our people arising from climate change itself. The floods that have brought death and suffering to Lancashire and Cumbria are just the latest reminder of those. As for diplomacy, the world’s governments will probably agree this week on a new basis for global action on climate. It will be a step forward. But it will only take us, at best, to the end of the beginning. Whether we can achieve the sustained effort that this challenge really demands will depend less on deals about to be done in Paris and more on choices made globally over the next five years as governments strive to turn their promises into action and push up levels of ambition that are still inadequate. The UK’s backward lurch has, thankfully, come too late to damage prospects at Paris. But it is nonsense to claim, as our ministers have, that the choices they are making will not cut our diplomacy off at the knees. And it is rich for them to accuse other parties of weaponising climate policy when it is they who have broken the cross-party consensus that gave our diplomacy a special edge. No country has done more than Britain to spur global progress on climate. We have done that by walking our talk, with strong diplomacy based on a strong domestic base. It would be a tragedy and a betrayal of our national interest if, just as our competitors pick up the pace, we start giving succour to those nations and industries that want to slow down an endeavour on whose success all our destinies depend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2014/sep/28/solar-energy-sunflower-ibm-airlight-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-27T23:05:03Z","webTitle":"Solar energy: a sunflower solution to electricity shortage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/28/solar-energy-sunflower-ibm-airlight-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/sep/28/solar-energy-sunflower-ibm-airlight-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy: a sunflower solution to electricity shortage","bodyText":"Computer giant IBM last week revealed the prototype of its advanced solar electricity generators: a 30ft-high concrete “sunflower” fitted with wafer-thin aluminium mirrors and a maze of tiny tubes for carrying coolant through the heart of each device. The machines, which will be built in conjunction with the Swiss company Airlight Energy, can convert 80% of the sun’s radiation into electricity and hot water, it is claimed, with each generating 12 kilowatts of electricity and 20kW of heat on a sunny day, enough to supply several homes. At the device’s official unveiling in Zurich, executives for both companies said they hoped that by 2017, when their sunflower generators should be ready for the market, they could be manufactured for half to one-third of the cost of comparable solar converters today. According to IBM, the machine’s secret lies with the microscopic tubes that carry water through the cluster of photovoltaic chips at the heart of each device. This system has already been adopted by IBM to cool its high-performance supercomputers. “We were inspired by the branched blood supply of the human body,” said Bruno Michel, from the IBM Research laboratories in Zurich. The sunflower operates by tracking the sun so that it always points in the best direction for collecting its rays; these are then focused on to a cluster of photovoltaic cells that are mounted on a raised platform. The cells convert solar radiation into electricity. However, without the microchannel cooling system, which carries distilled water through the chips, temperatures would reach more than 1,000C. With the microcooling system, which carries water to within a few millimetres of the back of each chip, temperatures are kept down to 90C – a far safer, and far more efficient, operating level. Electricity is generated while the system also produces large amounts of hot water from the cooling system. “That hot water is a game changer,” added Michel. “Electricity is obviously vitally useful but so is the heat – for we can use it for desalinating water.” At present, about 1.3 billion people have no access to electricity. However, that figure is dwarfed by the number – 2.5 billion – who have no access to proper sanitation. And according to figures supplied by Airlight Energy, that latter number is currently increasing at a rate of 9% a year. However, the IBM-Airlight sunflower is designed to tackle both problems. The electricity will have numerous uses while the hot water can be pumped through desalinators that use porous membranes to boil salt water and distil the result into pure, drinkable water. A large installation made up of several generators could provide enough fresh water for an entire town, it was claimed at last week’s launch. Apart from sites in Africa, the Middle East and Australia, it is hoped the sunflower system will be used for remote hospitals, hotels and holiday resorts. IBM says it will instal its first two devices for free in 2016 and has asked towns around the world to put their names forward to be the first to have a solar sunflower erected on their land."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2015/dec/04/africa-global-warming-paris-climate-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-04T13:48:56Z","webTitle":"Paris climate talks: Africa means business on global warming |  Akinwumi Adesina","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/04/africa-global-warming-paris-climate-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/dec/04/africa-global-warming-paris-climate-talks","fields":{"headline":"Africa means business on global warming – does the rest of the world?","bodyText":"The term “glacial pace” takes on real and literal meaning with climate change. The disappearance of our glaciers may have hastened dramatically, but our efforts to stop them doing so have moved at a truly glacial pace. This has to change, right now. Since the Kyoto protocol came into being, we have failed miserably to protect our planet. Current trajectories show the world is on track towards a temperature rise of about 3C by 2100. Climate talks in Paris this month are our last chance to turn the tide. We have long known that Africa, which causes the least environmental damage, suffers the most from the harm others cause. The World Meteorological Organisation recorded more than 1,300 climate-related natural disasters in Africa from 1970 to 2012, which claimed 700,000 lives and caused economic damage worth $26.6bn (£17.6bn). A decade ago, at COP 11 in Montreal in 2005, Africa had no common position and no common negotiators. This year, at COP 21, it has a Conference of African Heads of State on Climate Change; it has an expert team of about 200 climate negotiators; it has a clearly outlined position on the negotiations; and it has a well-articulated collective work programme to support low-carbon and climate-resilient development on the continent. So Africa means business on climate change. It comes to Paris not just with hope, but with something to offer. It brings three big “gives” to the rest of the world, and three big “asks”. First, Africa gives its own commitment – and the cast-iron evidence – that it will join the rest of the world in taking climate change seriously. Forty-seven out of 53 countries in Africa had already completed their “intended nationally determined contributions” by the 1 October deadline. Each national plan states what the country can do, from tiny Comoros committing to cutting emissions by 85% in 15 years, to Ethiopia announcing plans to cut its emissions growth by 64% in the same period. African countries have demonstrated greater ambition in cutting their emissions than the high-emitting nations. Second, Africa makes the gift – to itself and the world – of its enormous renewable energy resources. That potential is breathtaking: the continent can source an additional 10 terawatts of solar energy, 1,300 gigawatts of wind power, and 15GW of geothermal potential. That power, if used to the full and responsibly managed, will not just solve Africa’s own energy problems but also those of other countries near and far. Third, Africa gives to the world a share of the gigantic atmospheric vacuum cleaners that are its natural tropical forests. It has an estimated 650m hectares (1.605bn acres) of untouched forest, almost a fifth of the world’s stock. These carbon sinks can suck in 1.2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year – about half the carbon dioxide emissions from all the homes in the US. And they can do this, even under the threat of deforestation and forest degradation. If we can preserve our forest, for instance in the Congo basin, we can absorb more of our own and the world’s carbon dioxide. But Africa, of course, seeks support in kind from the world. It brings three “asks” to COP21, all of which are aimed at completing the circle of giving. First, Africa asks for adequate finance – at least $11bn a year – to help it adapt to climate change. Only 4% of the world’s total adaptation finance ends up in sub-Saharan Africa, a situation that demands immediate reform. Africa, which is already short-changed on climate change, must not be short-changed on climate finance. Communities that have contributed the least to climate change should not be the ones picking up the tab when Mother Earth fights back. As we write, southern and eastern Africa are suffering floods and droughts respectively, brought about by the worst El Niño – warm winds blowing off warm waters – in decades. Second, Africa asks the world to join it in investing at least $55bn a year in its energy sector up to 2030. Why? Mainly because this would bring full energy access to more than 600 million Africans who do not have that today. Patchy energy means patchy business, patchy health and patchy education. It means diminished life. The lack of energy has put the brakes on Africa’s development. Why should the rest of the world buy into this? Because, by developing clean energy in Africa, we will collectively remove billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases from the air. And because – given the returns on renewable energy – we will collectively unlock millions of dollars in new business opportunities. Witness the solar power project in Ouarzazate in Moroccowhich has generated 500MW and cut an annual 760,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The third and last ask is that the countries of the world reassess the demands they are making of one another. Limiting the global temperature rise to 2C is not enough: we stand with the International Panel on Climate Change in wanting a revised target of 1.5 degrees. The continent of proverbs reminds us that “in moments of crisis, the wise build bridges”. We are indeed in a crisis, and Africa is asking the rest of the world to join us in building bridges to a safer world. So let’s be wise in Paris. • Akinwumi Adesina is the president of the African Development Bank"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/oct/03/hydrogen-cars-electrolysers-dawn-australia-hydrogen-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-02T19:40:58Z","webTitle":"Hydrogen cars and electrolysers: the dawn of Australia's hydrogen economy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/03/hydrogen-cars-electrolysers-dawn-australia-hydrogen-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/03/hydrogen-cars-electrolysers-dawn-australia-hydrogen-economy","fields":{"headline":"Hydrogen cars and electrolysers: the dawn of Australia's hydrogen economy?","bodyText":"The hydrogen economy has been a long time coming. The use of hydrogen as a replacement energy source for oil and gas has been talked about since the early 1970s when the term was first coined by an engineer at General Motors in the US. It still hasn’t really arrived. And doubters remain. They point to the heavy infrastructure needed to support the technology, the huge amount of energy it consumes, and wonder how it can compete with the falling costs of wind and solar energy, and the surging interest in electric vehicles (EVs) . Ironically, it is those very factors that are making the idea of a hydrogen economy appealing again. Wind and solar provide cheap energy, EVs are perfecting the drive trains [the power delivery system from engine to wheels] that hydrogen cars will use, and there have been significant technology breakthroughs making the hardware needed to make hydrogen much more cost-competitive. Now it appears that in Australia, the hydrogen economy is going to have its first home in the Australian Capital Territory. Having put in place the architecture and the contracts to ensure that the equivalent of 100% of the electricity needs are sourced from wind and solar by 2020, the Labor government in the ACT is looking at how that clean energy can be used for transport and heating. The environment and energy minister, Simon Corbell, recently announced that the two companies – Spain’s Union Fenosa and France’s Neoen – that won bids to provide electricity to build large wind farms to supply the ACT will invest $180m to develop hydrogen facilities. Union Fenosa, the developer of the Crookwell Wind Farm, will look at how to use hydrogen as a substitute for natural gas in gas-fired generators, either alone or in combination with natural gas; while Neoen will build Australia’s first commercial electrolyser to create hydrogen for vehicles and other uses. Union Fenosa will invest $125m, including a research and development partnership with the Australian National University and ActewAGL Distribution. This will focus on renewable energy power to gas, investigating efficiencies in the production of hydrogen from renewables and how it can then be introduced to the ACT gas network or provide support to the electricity network. A pilot testing facility will also be established in the ACT to produce hydrogen from water using the ACT’s 100% renewable electricity supply. For Garth Heron, the head of wind energy for Neoen in Australia, the idea of building Australia’s first commercial electrolyser came up as part of his company’s tender for the wind contract. He says there are three factors that made him change his mind about hydrogen energy. The first is hydrogen cars. These are often dismissed by EV enthusiasts as being just like petrol cars but with different fuel. That’s not exactly right. Hydrogen cars will use the same electric drive train as EVs, and because EVs are now a major focus of production, half the development problem is solved. Furthermore, in hydrogen cars, the fuel cell – which is as easy to fill as a petrol car, according to its proponents – replaces the petrol engine, while in EVs, it’s the battery that replaces the engine. The second issue is the amount of wind and solar energy used. The biggest input for making hydrogen is electricity. To make hydrogen, you need an electrolyser: electricity and water go in one end, and hydrogen and oxygen come out the other. But the process consumes a lot of power. Heron says that because wind and solar often produce excess energy, driving down wholesale electricity costs, this can then be used to power the electrolysers. The third factor is new technology which means these electrolysers can be switched on and off in an instant, taking advantage of the plunges in the wholesale price of electricity, and also providing network and load support when required. Neoen is teaming up with Siemens – which built the wind turbines for its big Hornsdale wind farm in South Australia – and will contribute $55m towards the cost of a 1.25MW electrolyser in the ACT. That’s enough to keep 1,200 hydrogen cars going each year, but initially it will power a fleet of just 20 new-generation Hyundai hydrogen cars, enough to test the infrastructure. Still, that 20 will be the first hydrogen fleet in the country. “The idea of a hydrogen fleet of vehicles sounds rather old-fashioned,” Garth says. “It was an idea in vogue about 10 years ago, and people thought that because of battery technology, it made no sense. But then we started hearing more about hydrogen – from Hyundai and Siemens, and looking at what Toyota was doing, we realised that the technology has moved quite far.” “We wanted something that was major and long-lasting and could help turn the dial. And we wanted an idea that could attract business and others to the ACT to be part of the hydrogen economy that we hope will come out of it.” Heron says using electricity at low cost means fuel for hydrogen cars might be around 75c/litre. But still, there is more work to be done. “The main thing holding back the idea of hydrogen cars is infrastructure. We are not there yet. It is a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. We need infrastructure there to get cost down but without cars, there is no need for infrastructure. This plan in the ACT is to try to get around the situation. And we’re not saying hydrogen will replace every electric vehicle. We think there is lot of technology that common to both.” Currently Hyundai has a single hydrogen car in Australia as a demonstration model and plans that its fleet of 20 will come from a new, yet-to-be-released SUV-style vehicle. “This is the first order in the world for the vehicle,” says Hyundai spokesman Bill Thomas. The concept is so new it does not have a name, but could be based loosely around the Intrado concept car. “The ACT initiative is significant, because it is a forward looking and visionary statement about the potential for hydrogen for transport,” he says. And that is what attracts Corbell to the idea. He says the program to achieve 100% renewable energy for its electricity needs has made the ACT a centre for renewable energy and research. Half a dozen clean tech companies have made the ACT their home and a renewable energy hub at the Canberra Institute of Technology at Bruce has become a centre for research. Like the ACT’s groundbreaking battery storage initiative – a program to install batteries in 5,000 homes and businesses – the hydrogen initiative will attract more investment, says Corbell. And it won’t cost the local government or taxpayers a single dollar. It was Neoen and Union Fenosa who, quite separately, brought the idea of hydrogen to the ACT as part of their wind auction tenders. “This is an exciting project, and it is industry-led,” Corbell says. “We are not reaching a view that this technology will win over others. But it is a way to seize an opportunity to attract investment from companies – like Hyundai and Siemens – and grow our capacity to innovate. “That’s our opportunity. We [the ACT] are not manufacturers. But we can export ideas, innovation and skills.

US president-elect Donald Trump has picked climate sceptics and oil industry executives for key positions in his administration, promising to scrap President Obama’s clean power plan and withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Underlying these concerns is a gnawing fear that the rapid expansion of solar energy generation overseen by Obama could soon be undermined. The US installed a record 4.1GW of solar power in 2016’s third quarter, 191% up on the same period last year, in a boom fuelled by investment tax credits (ITCs) that offer solar and wind firms a 30% tax rebate. Industry leaders fear the tax credits may not survive a Trump administration which has vowed to cut $100bn (£80bn) of climate spending, and will need to find more savings to fund $6.2tn (£5tn) of tax cuts. “The tax credit will cost around $50bn in the period to 2022 and might be an easy choice for Trump,” said James Watson, the CEO of SolarPower Europe. “He’s got a very sceptical climate team around him who would not be too worried about cutting back the ITCs.” Solar employs more than oil and gas extraction Any moves in this direction could increase US emissions and have a toxic effect internationally, just as the budding solar industry is nearing cost parity with fossil fuels such as coal and gas. Renewable energy companies have already been battered by Trump’s victory, with shares in one US solar giant, SunPower Corp, plummeting 14% the day after the election. However, Trump has not yet commented on the future of the ITCs and some analysts say he may be loathe to go up against Republicans in Congress who recently voted to extend the scheme until 2022. Taylor Dimsdale, the head of the E3G thinktank in Washington, said that while signals from the Trump team had so far been mixed “to put it mildly”, its planned fossil fuel renaissance could be met without axing renewable subsidies. “There’s pretty strong bipartisan support for renewable energy,” he said. “A republican-controlled Congress just extended solar tax credits after a not particularly gruelling battle, because the solar industry is important in many states that are controlled by Republican legislatures and governors.” More Americans are now employed in the solar industry than on oil rigs or gas fields so cutbacks would face resistance. Even so, Dimsdale warned that if Trump makes good on a promise to cut corporation tax to 15%, “the ITC could be one of the first things to go”. Trump won’t derail solar growth Not all solar companies are so pessimistic. Milan Nitzschke, the vice president of SolarWorld, the largest solar panel manufacturer in the EU and US, said: “I have no concerns that the US market will not grow in the next years, as it did before. Mr Trump is a businessman and will already know that solar is one of cheapest sources of electricity. In the end, we should not forget that the sun is a great American energy source.” Few analysts foresee a contraction of the US solar industry even under a Trump presidency, but many expect growth to slow. Watson said that without the clean energy plan, “at best we will be looking at maintaining installation levels of around 8-10GW a year”. Trump’s outspoken stand against Chinese trade practices could even benefit the US and European markets, by restricting cheap solar panel imports, according to Nitzschke. SolarWorld has been an outlier in the solar industry, pushing strongly for anti-dumping measures against China. While Nitzschke is also president of the EU ProSun anti-dumping lobby group. He said: “If the US and its president-elect take concrete actions against China’s breaking of WTO trade rules and destruction of manufacturing jobs, it can grow its solar market and domestic solar industry.” Most European solar firms view the current tariffs on Chinese solar panels as an unnecessary tax on the industry that constrains expansion, and postpones the day that subsidies can be dispensed with altogether. SolarPower Europe, however, expects the Obama administration’s tariffs on Chinese solar panels to be continued without change. “Trump is talking about a 50% tax on all Chinese goods entering the US but solar duties are already much higher than that,” Watson said.

In fact, with the World Meteorological Organisation stating that 2016 is likely to be the hottest year on record, it’s no surprise an estimated 1.6bn new air conditioners are likely to be installed globally by 2050. Powering all these units will be a challenge, especially on summer’s hottest days. In Australia, peak demand days can drive electricity usage to almost double and upgrading infrastructure to meet the increased demand can cost more than four times what each additional air-conditioning unit costs. Yet an emerging sector of the solar industry is turning the searing heat of summer into cooling by using solar heat or electricity. For those developing the technology, the benefits of solar cooling are obvious: the days when cooling is needed the most are also the days when solar works best. When combined with a building’s hot water and heating systems – which together with cooling account for around half of the global energy consumption in buildings – solar cooling can drastically reduce reliance on grid energy and improve a building’s sustainability credentials. According to the International Energy Agency, solar could cover almost 17% of global cooling needs by 2050. Currently, such systems are still the exception. “It hasn’t got into the mainstream yet,” says Ken Guthrie, who chairs the International Energy Agency’s Solar Heating and Cooling Program. Nevertheless, several solar cooling technologies are making their way to market. While off-the-shelf systems for most are still years away, a handful of businesses have already opted for purpose-designed solar cooling systems, which experts hope will convince others to follow their lead. Echuca regional hospital in rural Victoria was one of the first to take the leap into solar cooling. In 2010, with support from Sustainability Victoria, the hospital designed and installed a solar heat–driven absorption chiller with engineering firm WSP consultants. A 300 sq m roof-mounted evacuated tube solar field feeds hot water to a 500 kW chiller that was set to save the hospital $60,000 on energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 1,400 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. The system was not designed to run entirely off solar (a gas-fired boiler takes up the slack on hot days), but “we have had days where we run 100% solar” for both cooling and hot water, says Echuca regional health executive project manager Mark Hooper. The benefits of solar were clear enough that a larger 1,500 kW chiller, connected to a field of trough-shaped solar collectors that track the sun during the day, was installed during the hospital’s recent expansion and redevelopment. This second chiller started operating in November and an analysis of the resulting energy and emissions savings will be assessed in conjunction with CSIRO. Meanwhile, Stockland Wendouree shopping centre in Ballarat, Victoria, is trialling a CSIRO-designed solar cooling system with funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena). Trough-shaped metal collectors on the centre’s rooftop collect solar heat that is used to dry out a desiccant matrix (much like the silica gel sachets in your shoebox) that dehumidifies air brought in from outside. The hot, dry air is then directed to an indirect evaporative cooler, which delivers cool, dry air into the shopping centre. The yearlong trial is still under way and hasn’t yet seen a full summer to calculate energy savings, but “it’s going very well,” says CSIRO’s Stephen White. The system is 50% more efficient than an earlier iteration of the design – an important improvement given many buildings don’t have the sprawling rooftop spaces of a shopping centre to mount large solar collector arrays. With photovoltaic cells more affordable than ever, cooling systems that run off solar electricity are already commercially available. But solar thermal systems could still find a place in the market, according to Guthrie, especially for larger commercial buildings. “There’s no single solution,” he says. Like any solar technology, solar cooling doesn’t work 24/7. Storing the solar energy collected during the day for use overnight is possible. Stockland’s system uses thermal oil storage, for example, and Echuca regional hospital has insulated its firewater tanks to store chilled water. But there are also efforts to store heat or cooling from one season to the next using underground storage tanks. Whichever systems a building adopts, White says the benefits of solar cooling extend beyond electricity savings. “It’s not just about the cents per kilowatt hour avoided, but it’s also about the value of the asset itself,” he says. For Hooper, the motivation was even simpler: “We did it to ensure that our children have a future.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/apr/16/boston-organic-food-farming-agriculture-startups","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-16T14:00:33Z","webTitle":"Is Boston the next urban farming paradise?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/16/boston-organic-food-farming-agriculture-startups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/16/boston-organic-food-farming-agriculture-startups","fields":{"headline":"Is Boston the next urban farming paradise?","bodyText":"For those seeking mild, year-round temperatures and affordable plots of land, Boston, with its long winters and dense population, isn’t the first city that comes to mind. But graduates of the city’s nearly 35 colleges and universities are contributing to the area’s growing reputation as a haven for startups challenging and transforming age-old industries, from furniture to political fundraising. The city’s strong entrepreneurial spirit, combined with progressive legislation like the passing of Article 89, has also turned Boston into one of the nation’s hubs for urban agriculture. The inspiration for Freight Farms, an urban farming business headquartered in South Boston, was launched after co-founders and friends Jon Friedman and Brad McNamara realized that New England currently gets almost 90% of its food from outside the region, yet 10-15% of households still report that they don’t have enough to eat. The over reliance on imported produce drove Friedman and McNamara to launch a Kickstarter campaign in 2011 for their farming business, which sells freight containers to would-be farmers, many of whom aren’t necessarily farmers by trade, but are interested in contributing to sustainable living. A Freight Farms container is designed to be largely self sustained, and uses solar energy to provide the majority of electricity required to grow the crops. Julia Pope, who works in farmer education and support at the organization, says people can find the freight containers squeezed between two buildings, in a parking lot, under an overpass, or virtually anywhere in the modern urban terrain. Freight Farms has spread north from Boston to Canada, and Pope says there are just over 100 of the company’s container farms operating in the US alone. The company outfits each 40ft container with the equipment for the entire farming cycle, from germination to harvest. This equipment, which the company calls Leafy Green Machine (LGM), creates a hydroponic system, a soil-free growing method that uses recirculated water with higher nutrient levels to help plants grow. Vertical growing towers line the inside of the shipping container, with LED lights optimized for each stage of the growing cycle. Farmers can manage conditions remotely using a smartphone app called Farmhand, which connects to live cameras inside the container. Pope says that of customers who have purchased the LGM, more than 50 have started small businesses, each consistently producing two acres worth of food year-round. One of these businesses is Corner Stalk Farm, which sells locally grown leafy greens – including kale, mint and arugula, as well as more than varieties of lettuce, to cater to demand at various farmers markets in Boston and Somerville, the city’s landmark Boston Public Market, and through orders from produce delivery services (such as Amazon Fresh) that are increasingly popular in cities. It’s no small feat to own and operate the LGM: purchasing one of the containers will run an aspiring business $85,000, with operating costs adding up to another estimated $13,000 per year. Luckily, steady consumer demand, evidenced by more than 139 farmers markets across the state of Massachusetts alone, help to offset the high costs to starting and running an urban farm. Hannah Brown, a resident of Boston’s North End, regularly shops at the Boston Public Market, which sells locally sourced goods from more than 30 small businesses. “There aren’t many stores with really fresh produce in the immediate area, so it’s definitely filled a need for me,” she says. Brown also finds the small business owners who sell their produce at the market to be an invaluable resource: “It’s great to be able to talk with the people working the produce stands, because they can recommend what’s freshest and how to prepare it.” As a result, she says she’s taken to only buying produce that’s in season and adjusting her habits to align with what’s available to her locally. The growing popularity of urban farming owes much to a former mayor, Thomas Menino, and one of his final acts while in office. He signed into law Article 89, expanded zoning laws to permit farming in freight containers, on rooftops, and in larger ground-level farms. Article 89 made it possible for those practitioners to sell their locally grown food within city limits. One business that has taken advantage of Article 89 is Green City Growers, which runs Fenway Farms, is a 5,000-sq ft rooftop farm above Fenway Park. The rooftop is lined with plants grown in stackable milk crate containers, which are equipped with a weather sensitive drip irrigation system that monitors the moisture of the soil in the crates to make sure plants get just the right amount of water. Although the farm isn’t open to the general public, it is visible to fans from the baseball park, and a stop on the Fenway Park tour. Boston is far from alone in passing legislation that makes farming a possibility for city-dwellers. In Sacramento, there are even tax incentives for property owners who agree to put their vacant plots of land to active agricultural use for at least five years, while the city council of San Antonio voted just last year to pass legislation that makes urban farming legal throughout city limits. And while Boston boasts home to various agricultural startups and nonprofits, entrepreneurs in other parts of the country are contributing to a national farming movement in their own ways: Kimbal Musk, brother of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, recently set up a container farm in an old Pfizer factory in Brooklyn, while Local Roots Farms is turning shipping containers into urban farms (using the same hydroponic method that the LGM uses) across the Los Angeles area. As Bostonians now find themselves with a slew of new options to grow and profit from fresh produce on rooftops and in alleyways, some nonprofit organizations are looking to use urban farming as an educational asset. CitySprouts was born in Cambridge in 2001 after executive director Jane Hirschi identified what she calls “an immense need for children to understand where their food was coming from”. CitySprouts teams up with educators to set aside class time for students to cultivate gardens on school property that they can grow their own food in. There are now more than 20 public schools using CitySprouts gardens in the Boston area, and more than 300 public school teachers participating in the fresh food program. Caitlin O’Donnell, who teaches first grade at Fletcher Maynard Academy in nearby Cambridge, says the program does a great job of giving urban kids the opportunity to interact with their environment in ways they wouldn’t have otherwise, she adds. “Whether students are digging for worms, sketching roots structures, crushing apples for cider, or sampling chives and basil, their hands are busy and their senses are engaged ...what makes City Sprouts most effective (and exceptional) is that it is collaborative and flexible by design.” Boston’s rise in the national urban farming movement also has helped to make locally grown produce more available to low-income residents. Leah Shafer recalls that she was able to use food stamps at a farmer’s market to receive half-off of her purchases of kale, blueberries, and more. “It made it possible for me to buy organic, local produce that I otherwise just wouldn’t have been able to afford. I don’t think I would have been able to support local farmers without that discount,” she says.

The clean energy industry, consumer groups and conservationists all blamed federal government actions, like reviewing the renewable energy target and maintaining the policy of axing the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, despite the bills axing them being blocked by the Senate. In the most recent data from the 2014-2015 financial year, 5,100 full-time equivalent jobs had gone from the sector since the 2011-2012 financial year, a drop of 27%, leaving 14,020 people working in the industry. However, the ABS said that was still an increase from the 11,520 recorded for 2009-2010. Mark Lound, ABS director of environmental statistics, said the Employment in Renewable Energy Activities publication examines levels of employment in renewable energy by state and territory and by type of renewable energy activities. “Solar energy (including roof-top solar PV, solar hot water and large scale solar PV) is the most significant source of employment among renewable energy activities,” he said. “In 2014-15 annual [full-time equivalent] employment in solar was 8,310 or 59% of total employment in renewable energy activities. Employment in solar energy peaked at 14,350 in 2011-12.” South Australia saw the most significant drop as a proportion of their total jobs, with a 60% decrease over the four years. Western Australia was next, with a 51% decrease, followed by Queensland with a 36% drop. The drops in those states were slightly offset by small increases in employment in the industry in New South Wales, the Northern Territory and the ACT. Employment in the industry remained roughly steady in Tasmania. The figures were “disappointing but not surprising” said Kelly O’Shanassy, CEO of the Australian Conservation Foundation. “The federal government sets the tone for the nation and this government has not been supportive of clean energy,” she said. “The government dragged out negotiations over the renewable energy target while attempting to cut the target and has had Australia’s primary renewable energy agency, Arena, on the chopping block for this entire parliamentary term ... This is no way to instil confidence in the sector. “Unfortunately the federal government continues to throw its weight behind last century’s energy sources, approving massive new coal mines like Adani’s Carmichael mine, proposed for the Galilee Basin in Queensland.” Solar Citizens, a solar energy consumer group, said the figures showed Turnbull “must move from rhetoric to action”. “The Australian renewable industry is still being held back by uncertainty over government policy and investment,” said the Solar Citizens national director, Claire O’Rourke. Kane Thornton, CEO of the Clean Energy Council the peak body for the clean energy industry in Australia, said it was a tough period for the industry, during a review of the renewable energy target but said there’s been an uplift since the Paris agreement and since Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott. Thornton said when the next set of figures comes out, they would show an increase in jobs in the sector."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/nov/08/online-bank-tesco-moment-cyberattack","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-08T19:49:32Z","webTitle":"My online bank gave me a Tesco moment | Tim Dowling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/online-bank-tesco-moment-cyberattack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/online-bank-tesco-moment-cyberattack","fields":{"headline":"My online bank gave me a Tesco moment","bodyText":"The plight of Tesco banking customers, who have had £17m stolen from their accounts in some kind of cyberattack, calls into question our weird faith in online banking. Forty-eight hours before the news broke, I was on the phone trying to sort out my own little crisis. Last week I transferred a not inconsiderable sum of money from one account to another – both mine, but with different banks. It’s precisely the sort of everyday administrative pain in the arse that online banking has revolutionised: click, confirm, done. The money promptly disappeared from one account – and singularly failed to materialise in the other. I waited a day. Then another. When nothing changed, I rang the first bank to make a polite inquiry about the anomaly. After checking I had input all the numbers correctly, the man on the helpline said there was nothing more he could do – I needed to speak to the other bank. To me he sounded like an airline spokesman explaining why a plane that has vanished off the radar is actually the responsibility of the destination airport. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the helpline woman at my other bank didn’t really feel like taking responsibility for a transaction she had absolutely no record of. At this point I started to get a cold, fluttery feeling in my chest. Shuffling money around cyberspace – what had made me think that would work? The helpline woman suggested I call the first bank and ask them to put a forward trace on the money, or something. The first bank transferred me around a bit before telling me I needed to update my security settings in order to proceed further. I patiently followed instructions for changing my password to one with more numbers in it, all the while resisting the urge to shout “WHERE’S MY MONEY, MAN?” into the phone. Eventually I achieved a security clearance sufficient for them to confess they had held up my transaction on purpose because it seemed so out of character. I got a letter to that effect three days later. Solar confusion Way down the US election ballot, below Clinton and Trump, there were also all manner of local referendums to be voted on. From legalising pot to reinstating the death penalty, this is how a lot of state laws are made in America these days. You may have lately become acquainted with the notion that a referendum is a pure expression of the people’s will – preferable to representative democracy – but in most cases that depends on the relative clarity or opacity of the question being asked. Should you ever need a startling example of the latter, look to Florida. Florida’s amendment 1 promised to guarantee residents’ constitutional right to own solar panels. Sounds great. But a second part of the amendment – its true purpose, cynics might say, since the measure is supported by big power utilities – relieves residents who don’t produce solar energy from the obligation to subsidise its production. In other (less weasly) words, it would end the solar panel owner’s automatic right to sell surplus electricity back to the grid. So, yes or no to solar, voter? Quickly, there’s a queue. Glimpsed in the black mirror I experienced another sort of cyberattack this week, when Facebook dropped a picture of me “7 years ago” into my timeline, asking if I wanted to Share it. No thanks. It’s just me, sitting at my desk, staring into the webcam. I don’t even remember taking it. It felt like an invasion of privacy, although my main reaction was one of denial: that was never seven years ago. I didn’t own that shirt seven years ago. I didn’t look like that seven years ago. I was young seven years ago. That old man in the picture: that’s what I look like now. I stared at it, disbelieving, until my screen went dark, and I got a quick reflective glimpse of what I really look like now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development/2015/oct/02/lack-of-electricity-locks-people-in-poverty-low-carbon-energy-is-the-key","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-02T13:44:21Z","webTitle":"Lack of electricity locks people in poverty – low-carbon energy is the key | Mafalda Duarte","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/02/lack-of-electricity-locks-people-in-poverty-low-carbon-energy-is-the-key","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/oct/02/lack-of-electricity-locks-people-in-poverty-low-carbon-energy-is-the-key","fields":{"headline":"Lack of electricity locks people in poverty – low-carbon energy is the key","bodyText":"Steam billows from an energy plant in a stretch of Kenya’s Great Rift Valley, about 180km north of the capital, Nairobi. But the white clouds rising from the tidy grid of pipes aren’t a sign of polluting greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. They are a signal that the country of more than 44 million, where some 65% of the population does not have access to electricity, is one giant step closer to delivering clean, reliable, renewable power to its people. The first phase of the $746m Menengai geothermal development project is well under way, with already proven steam resources capable of generating 130 megawatts of electricity and working toward commissioning the first power plants in 2016. At its full 400MW potential, the project aims to provide stable, low-cost power to about 500,000 households and 300,000 businesses, and avoid nearly 2m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually. The expansion of Menengai is just one of many projects the government is pursuing as part of its plan to generate 5,500MW of geothermal power by 2031. Kenya’s current geothermal capacity is 595MW, but the ministry of energy estimates the country has the potential to produce about 10,000MW. Across Africa and around the world, low-carbon renewable energy is emerging as the go-to green growth and poverty reduction strategy. Kenya’s neighbours Ethiopia and Tanzania are also pursuing geothermal power, while countries in the Middle East and north Africa are focusing their efforts on expanding solar power. Still others are exploring mini-grid and off-grid solutions in wind and solar to supply the poorest and hardest-to-reach rural communities. More than 1 billion people worldwide still lack access to electricity that could enable them to light their homes, cook or pump clean water. During my 15 years working in development in Africa and Asia, and now at the helm of Climate Investment Funds, I have seen how a lack of electricity handcuffs poor families to poverty – especially women and girls, who have to gather fuel and carry out the household chores. The success of every one of the 17 sustainable development goals, formally adopted at the UN in September, depends on a swell of renewable, sustainable and affordable energy. The greatest barrier facing Kenya and other developing countries is a lack of funding to develop their renewable energy potential. Renewable energy plants are expensive to build. But once they are up and running, they can deliver cheap flows of energy. Reaching that point, however, takes millions of dollars in investment that most poor countries cannot easily access. One way to surmount this barrier is to provide countries with the starter funds they need to get their renewable energy operations off the ground, supported by policies that inspire confidence and growth. Once countries have made progress, they can more easily convince new investors to chip in, especially from the private sector. Climate Investment Funds has provided $25m in concessional financing for Menengai in Kenya to help cover exploratory drilling – a critical but risky stage of development and a cost that most private investors are unwilling to bear. In fact, the company has earmarked $810m to advance geothermal power projects in 15 countries. This could potentially yield 3.5GW of new geothermal capacity, more than a quarter of current global installed capacity of almost 13 GW. Prospects are promising, and more than $10bn is expected from other financiers. This is a start, but so much more must be done to make geothermal and other renewable energy markets viable in developing countries. The risks are high, but so are the rewards if forward-thinking countries like Kenya and early investors, like Climate Investment Funds, are willing to lay the groundwork. Meeting the ambitious targets set in the SDGs, and fulfilling the commitments each country makes in a hoped-for global agreement after UN climate talks this winter, means developing countries have to advance along a low-carbon pathway. For the good of our planet and our people, we must invest in this progress.

Trump tweeted in 2014 that research on global warming is “very expensive bullshit” that “has to stop”. Scientists are braced to find out whether his administration will put these words into practice. The early signs are not good. Last month Scott Pruitt, one of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s fiercest critics, was named as its new head. There are rumours that the budget of its office for research could be cut by more than 40% as part of extensive overall cuts. Meanwhile there are reports that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), one of America’s leading climate science agencies, could have its budget cut by nearly 20%. The agency’s satellite division, a vital source of data for climate research, is expected to bear the brunt of cuts. British scientists say moves to squeeze funding of climate-related research in the US – and of facilities at government laboratories in particular – could be disastrous for work in the UK. And they say Trump’s travel ban is already harming their collaboration with scientists in America, with some researchers pulling out of commitments in the UK because of fears they may not make it back through US visa controls. Prof Joanna Haigh, co-director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, says: “Everything we do is international, and we particularly rely on American satellite data. Perhaps we could manage if other areas were cut – perhaps the Chinese or the Indians might even step in to fill the gaps – but we would definitely miss the satellite data from the US.” Haigh uses satellite data to study how the sun influences the Earth’s climate. She is helping to disentangle the effect of natural fluctuations in solar energy from those of manmade greenhouse gases – and she is clear that global warming cannot be attributed to the sun or other natural processes. “At Imperial we use NOAA satellite data for many important climate studies. For example, it can tell us how much of the sun’s energy the Earth absorbs, how much heat energy it emits and how these values depend on other factors, particularly cloud cover.” She says cutting the NOAA’s budget would be a “huge hit” not only for science, but also for our understanding of the weather. “They are trying to get rid of everything that could be badged as climate change. But to understand the climate you need to measure the weather. You can’t separate the two. Whether you are on a climate change ‘bandwagon’ is irrelevant.” Prof Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at Leeds University, says: “If organisations like Nasa and the NOAA are prohibited from putting up new satellites, that could be really detrimental for the entire international science community. We urgently need these data sets to be able to monitor and understand climate change.” Like many scientists Forster fears a cull across a number of US government laboratories concerned with climate change. “Our one biggest concern is the loss of raw talent,” he says. “The loss of people we collaborate with and the people producing this data that we rely on.” He says the Trump administration is already making scientific collaboration across the Atlantic more difficult. “Quite a lot of the academics we work with in America are immigrants and some of them are concerned about leaving the country in case they don’t get back in. We’ve certainly seen instances where people have pulled out of coming to scientific conferences. Four or five people I know of, speakers and so forth, have pulled out of their commitments to come here.” In a recent example a key scientist from Princeton University pulled out of a climate change workshop that Forster co-organised at Imperial College London. American research fellow Dr Sarah Batterman moved to Leeds University to work on tropical forests and climate change a year ago after doing postdoctoral research at Princeton. She is in regular contact with colleagues in the US and says: “The situation for people doing climate-related science in the US is really scary. There is so much uncertainty. I think people are trying to keep their heads down and keep their research going as much as they can until they see what is going to happen.” Batterman works closely with scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, a US government laboratory in Panama, and is concerned about whether its funding will continue. “My research wouldn’t be possible without the Smithsonian facilities. So for me this isn’t just something that is happening at a distance,” she explains. For Prof Rosalind Cornforth, director of the Walker Institute at Reading University, the anxiety about the US pulling the plug on climate science is somewhat different. Her institute works with governments and scientists in some of the world’s most fragile, conflict-affected countries, applying climate science to solve real-world problems. “So many of our fellow climate scientists from developing countries rely on access to climate data sets available in the US,” she says. “If these become restricted in the future, there would be repercussions on vital capacity development for places like Africa.” There is one potential silver lining for UK universities in this cloud of uncertainty. Vice-chancellors at some leading universities said last week they hoped to be able to woo some big-name climate scientists from across the Atlantic. Forster, whose institute is only a year old and is recruiting staff, says: “I have just got back from a trip to America to talk to people. Many scientists think it is too early to leave. They don’t know quite what Trump will do, and there is even some optimism that perhaps he won’t survive a four-year term. But they are definitely interested in talking to us about possibilities.” Prof Paul Ekins, director of University College London’s Institute for Sustainable Resources, says many climate scientists may feel forced to leave the US if conditions worsen. “If you are in a science field that depends on expensive equipment, like climate science research from space, and you can’t get that kit because the funding dries up, you can’t do anything. This is applied, practical work trying to understand what is happening to the climate. US scientists may well hope that things will change with the future administration, but they may not want to write off four to eight years of their productive lives.” However, some climate scientists point out that with Brexit looming Britain may struggle to present itself as a place of calm and stability from which to escape Trump. Batterman says: “I think early career researchers who are looking for jobs may be considering options abroad. But there is also a lot of uncertainty in the UK too, because we don’t know what is going to happen with funding after the UK leaves the EU.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"small-business-network/2017/mar/10/virtual-ring-i-thee-wed-how-to-wedding-virtual-reality","type":"article","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-10T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"With this virtual ring, I thee wed ... how to tie the knot in VR","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/mar/10/virtual-ring-i-thee-wed-how-to-wedding-virtual-reality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/2017/mar/10/virtual-ring-i-thee-wed-how-to-wedding-virtual-reality","fields":{"headline":"With this virtual ring, I thee wed ... how to tie the knot in VR","bodyText":"Anyone who has planned a wedding knows the effort involved. Choosing a venue, whittling down the guestlist, writing vows, picking a colour scheme … the to-do list goes on. Remarkably, for Cardiff couple Martin Shervington and Elisa Evans, who are holding their ceremony in virtual reality in May, the list looks much the same – that is, if you don’t count the two robot avatars they’ve chosen to represent themselves as they say their vows, one pink and one blue. The wedding will take place at a virtual nightclub called the Spire, complete with a red mottled sky and lava lake. Shervington and Evans have invited 150 of their friends and family to attend – many of whom wouldn’t have been able to make it to a real-life wedding in Cardiff. More and more couples are hiring companies to record their big day using 360-degree video, but a ceremony in virtual reality has only happened once before. In 1994, a San Francisco couple, Monika and Hugh Jo, were married on the island of Atlantis. The software required reportedly would have cost $1m (£820,000), but was covered by the VR company Monika worked for, CyberMind. Hosting Shervington and Evans’s ceremony is San Francisco-based social VR platform AltspaceVR. Founder Eric Romo says the idea of a virtual reality wedding did not come as a surprise to him: “I thought it was perfect. This is exactly [...] the sort of thing we think is a really good use of the technology. What we’re trying to do is bring people together and make them feel connected in a way that we can’t on a phone call or video chat.” The virtual and augmented reality market has grown substantially since 2010, when American teenager Palmer Luckey created the first VR headset prototype, which evolved into the Oculus Rift. Two years later, Mark Zuckerberg bought the company for $2bn. Sony, Playstation and Samsung have all brought out their own headsets since. But the majority of VR’s fans and product developers have come from the gaming sector. Romo is an exception. A mechanical engineer by trade, he was one of the first employees at SpaceX – the private firm that recently announced it is committed to sending two citizens to the moon in 2018 – before leaving to study an MBA at Stanford University. He later started his own solar technology company in 2006. “That was an interesting journey for me,” he says. “[The business] went from two guys and a white board trying to figure out what they might want to do with solar energy, to raising $120m in venture capital, having 100 employees and manufacturing operations in China.” He wound up the business in 2012 after “everybody except the Chinese manufacturers went out of business,” an experience that he admits “was less fun”. But it was in the downturn of 2010–11 that his interest was piqued by virtual reality technologies and he started reading up on it in his spare time. “The idea of connecting in virtual spaces has been around as long as people have been working on computers, basically,” Romo says. “We don’t believe you’re going to turn people who aren’t interested in games into gamers because of VR. But the idea that I can connect with my friends and family all over the world, in a deeper way [than previously possible], we think that resonates with everybody.” VR technology is already being trialled by healthcare professionals to treat conditions such as Alzheimer’s; Munich-based startup Icaros is attempting to revolutionise the fitness industry; and experts are exploring VR’s potential to train workers in industries where accidents are common, such as the NHS, aviation and the military. On a more basic level, Romo holds weekly meetings in VR and has found it a particularly useful medium when there are multiple people speaking. “With VR, like in real life, you have the ability to make eye contact, to gesture, the ability to point at something, or to turn and look at the person who’s speaking. Those things that are really subtle and simple, and that just happen when you’re together. “On a phone or video call, all we can do is talk. I can’t hand you something [as I can in VR]. If you think about how you connect with someone in real life, often there are physical objects or media that facilitates your communication.” Despite the growing fascination with the industry, the number of users is still low – an estimated 43m worldwide – and sales of virtual reality headsets in 2016 were far lower than anticipated. Playstation VR, for example, was expected to sell 2.6m units but dropped this to 750,000. Consultants Digi-Capital had originally anticipated that the augmented and virtual reality sector would reach $150bn by 2020 (with VR accounting for $30bn of that), but in January 2017 downgraded its forecast to $108bn by 2021 (VR accounting for $25bn). Romo won’t disclose how many users AltspaceVR has but says they cover 150 countries. His figures show participants are typically engaged for 15–20 minutes on mobile devices compared with an average of just three to four minutes on non-social VR platforms. He believes that the restrictive nature of the available hardware – particularly the need for a high-powered desktop to run the programmes – has held back the widespread adoption of the technology. Beyond weddings, AltspaceVR has been involved with some interesting initiatives – it’s hosted an international film festival, held concerts and art shows in VR, and a comedy show with comedian Reggie Watts and actor Justin Roiland. Events are currently free but Romo sees the potential for organisers to charge in the future. AltspaceVR’s Frontrow technology makes it seem as though there are only around 30 people there, even if there are a thousand in attendance, so everyone can get close to the performers. So what does the future hold for VR? Will we all be getting married, holding business meetings and watching entertainment together in a virtual space? Romo won’t be drawn into making predictions. “People who tend to work in this space tend to come with a lot of sci-fi baggage. They’ve read all these sci-fi novels and have this vision they’ve been dreaming about for the last 30 years of what virtual reality should be that guides their product design and their idea of what is going to be fulfilling for people.” A better approach, suggests Romo, is trial and error. “The right way to find out is to test and experiment and get people using it. I’m most proud of our passion for experimentation – getting things in front of people as quickly as possible and then finding out if it’s good. We’re often really surprised at what good looks like.” Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/apr/13/vermont-maple-syrup-industry-new-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-13T11:00:02Z","webTitle":"Sweet science: Vermont maple syrup industry embraces hi-tech tricks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/13/vermont-maple-syrup-industry-new-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/apr/13/vermont-maple-syrup-industry-new-technology","fields":{"headline":"Sweet science: Vermont maple syrup industry embraces hi-tech tricks","bodyText":"The late March wind tugs at the jackets of Mooretown Elementary students as they clamber after Burr Morse into a wooden sugar shack. Morse, 70, is taking a break from preparing for open house weekend, the annual Vermont maple free-for-all, where 94 farms will open their doors to the public, offering sugar-on-snow, sleigh rides, and maple treats. The sap is temporarily frozen, but sugarers are anticipating potential flow over the weekend, when the temperatures hit a high of 40 degrees. They’ll extract it using high-tech reverse osmosis machines, refine it at a level three times as efficient as a 2004 farm, and power the whole facility using wind power, solar energy and cow manure. The industry’s gains in efficiency have even offset a problem creeping up on all agriculture: climate change, which is shortening the sugaring season. The Vermont sugar industry predates European colonists, and in its current iteration is both folksy and hi-tech. Farmers across the state man their posts by expensive evaporators and thousands of miles of plastic piping from snowbound trees to the warmth of smoking sugar houses. Sugaring was a tradition started by Native American tribes and carried on by Vermont settlers who couldn’t afford processed white sugar at their general stores. Two hundred years later, it continues as a booming industry. Morse Farm Seventy years ago, Morse’s grandparents moved their dairy and maple production down the road to the current farm, but the old wooden structure stands as a reminder of the farming his family has done on hundreds of acres since the 1790s. When his father sold all of the family Jersey cattle in 1966, the Morses turned to sugaring entirely, increasing their tapping from 3,000 trees to 5,000 in 2014. Morse and his son Tom, 36, have worked to modernize the farm with reverse osmosis machines, and oil-fired evaporators that expedite the process far beyond the old method of tapping a tree and leaving a bucket hanging to collect sap. Now, 5/16-inch tubing brings sap from thousands of trees to the small sugarhouse, outlining the white snow like blue-green capillaries, and saving farmers from the task of loading hundreds of gallons of sap onto pickup trucks. Afterward, a reverse osmosis machine reduces the sap’s water content, and evaporator starts the boiling. “We bring it from 2% sugar content when the sap comes out of the tree,” explains Morse. “We get it there in a reverse osmosis machine. Then in an evaporator to get it to 66% sugar content.” The evaporator removes water from the sap before boiling increasing the sugar level, and the liquid is filtered and bottled. Boiling sap once took over 12 hours – now, it can be done as quickly as 30 minutes for a batch. When sugarers go green Chris Trudeau, 24, watches sap boil in a $100,000 evaporator. On a good day, it can process 140 gallons of syrup an hour. Trudeau’s extended family, the Harrisons, own Georgia Mountain Maples, and he works there with 26 other full-time and seasonal employees. In December, he spent a month with other workers individually tapping the 120,000 trees on the 2,000-acre property, a large mountain in the middle of Milton. Trudeau said: “I’ve been here since the start of it. I used to do buckets in high school.” Sap comes in through 500 miles of tubing to a reverse osmosis machine, into 9,500-gallon concrete holding tanks, then into the evaporator that Trudeau oversees. After being filtered, the syrup is barreled and poured into containers. Shannon, Kevin, and Cathy Harrison opened Georgia Mountain Maples six years ago. Unlike the Morses, they sell wholesale. The Harrisons’ concrete company has 100 employees. When it’s offseason for concrete, they switch over some of the staff to the sugarhouse to ensure they won’t have to be laid off. Sugarers use everything from tree taps to submersible pumps to maple cream-making machines in the 21st-century iteration of their business, and Georgia Mountain Maples uses the Georgia Mountain Community wind farm, which sends power from its 10-megawatt wind turbines back into the grid. There’s a solar component, too: “Our solar project creates enough to offset our bills,” Kevin Harrison explained. The farm itself runs on gas, purchasing “cow power” through Green Mountain Power Company, which converts methane from cow manure into fuel. Fourteen farms and 13,500 cows are part of the program, creating 73,000 tons of methane – the equivalent of burning more than 8.2m gallons of gas. Cow power powers 3,200 Vermont homes. Does all of this interest in cheap energy speak to concern about the effects of climate change? It depends on who you ask; clean power is also cheap and efficient power. Harrison said, “We made a lot of syrup in January and February, but then again, it’s only a week or two, then a stop. I don’t know what normal is anymore. It’s definitely about temperature.” In 2017, for the first time many Vermont sugarers were tapping in January due to mild temperatures. With every shift in temperature comes the high price of shutting down operations only to start up again every few weeks. Despite the earlier sugaring times, the maple season is three days shorter than it has been in the past, according to the Proctor Maple Research Center at the University of Vermont. Fifteen years ago, this would have meant a 10% smaller crop, or a major economic hit, but technology has increased yields so significantly that a briefer season is not yet a problem. New technology Although most sugarers admit that human-caused climate change exists, they don’t seem to think it is influencing them. Most farm owners mentioned the change in the season starting as their indicator that “something is off”. But if anything is amiss, it appears to be benefiting them. Timothy Perkins, director of the Proctor Maple Research Center, said: “It’s hard to say if anything is happening in one year. What we’ve seen in the past 50 is the season changing, and happening earlier in the calendar year.” He does believe that improved sap collection techniques and sanitation have improved sugaring and increased yields because they take the trees into consideration. He explained, “trees are like all living organisms; they don’t want infections. When you drill, you create a wound. For people, we develop a scab, then the wound is healed. Trees internally wall off that wound to spread infection from spreading into tree from microbes in the tap hole.” The typical maple tree tap generates .2 gallons of syrup over time, an average Proctor Center has tripled in a 13-year average to .6 gallons. Meanwhile, local news stations are buzzing about new technology that will decrease the time, cost, and amount of energy it takes to make a gallon of syrup. Usually, it takes four gallons of oil to produce a single gallon of syrup. With new a new kind of high “brix” (sugar concentration) reverse osmosis machine and evaporator, it only takes 0.18 gallons. Of course, new technology is always expensive. Farmers are worried the expedited process might change the flavor of syrup. The Proctor Center has been testing samples from Canadian maple farms, and also tried blind taste tests with consumers. “We have taste panels, some from the high brix machine, and some from normal production. People couldn’t tell the difference. We are perfectly convinced it makes good syrup.” This article was amended on 17 April 2017 to clarify that wind turbines power Georgia Mountain Maples, not Morse Farm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/09/clean-coal-wont-be-commercially-viable-before-2030-energy-analysis-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-08T19:14:56Z","webTitle":"'Clean' coal won't be commercially viable before 2030, energy analysis says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/09/clean-coal-wont-be-commercially-viable-before-2030-energy-analysis-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/09/clean-coal-wont-be-commercially-viable-before-2030-energy-analysis-says","fields":{"headline":"'Clean' coal won't be commercially viable before 2030, energy analysis says","bodyText":"“Clean” coal technologies won’t be commercially viable before 2030 without government subsidy and are fundamentally out of sync with the move towards more flexible power generation, according to the energy market analysis firm RepuTex. In a new analysis released on Thursday, RepuTex argues that the rising price of gas, coupled with the falling cost of energy storage, has now made renewable energy the cheapest source of reliable power generation in Australia. The long lead time before technologies such as carbon capture and storage reach commercial maturity means “clean” coal won’t help Australia meet its 2030 emissions reduction target under the Paris agreement. RepuTex used its submission to the Finkel review to argue that a market signal was required to determine the value of abatement and to allow an orderly retirement of ageing coal-fired generators. The firm said the market signal could take the form of an emissions intensity scheme, a legislated emissions benchmark, cap, or target that “better links emissions reduction objectives to the operation of the Australian electricity system”. While the debate accompanying the Finkel review has centred on the electricity industry, RepuTex pointed out energy was not the only source of low-cost emissions reduction potential in the Australian economy. “Outside of the generation sector, the effort to reduce emissions could therefore be spread across the economy,” the firm said. “This may be achieved via the design of sectoral targets for industrial emitters via the safeguard mechanism, supported by emissions offsets, which would enable companies to reduce emissions at lower cost, while incentivising investment in cleaner, more efficiency energy technology.” The call by RepuTex for a clear market signal follows similar arguments mounted by the National Farmers’ Federation, which this week reversed its once-vociferous opposition to carbon pricing. Other major organisation to champion a market mechanism include Energy Networks Australia, the retailer EnergyAustralia, the electricity provider AGL, the Climate Change Authority, the Investor Group on Climate Change, the Business Council of Australia and the CSIRO. The official conducting the energy review, the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, gave implicit support for an emissions intensity scheme in his preliminary report, saying it would integrate best “with the electricity market’s pricing and risk management framework” and “had the lowest economic costs and the lowest impact on electricity prices”. The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, initially signalled the government would look at the desirability of an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector as part of its scheduled review of its Direct Action climate policy – but he reversed his position after an internal Coalition revolt. A major stakeholder in Australia’s politically toxic carbon pricing debate, the Minerals Council of Australia, has used its submission to rebuke Finkel for floating an intensity scheme in his preliminary report without detailed analysis of the costs. While the MCA doesn’t rule out supporting such a scheme, noting it is appropriate to consider all policy options, it says Finkel conducted “virtually no serious analysis of the economic costs”. The council, which represents Australia’s mining giants, says modelling “relied upon by the independent review shows the costs of an EIS are very high”. “For example, close analysis of one of the cited reports … shows the total additional cost to household and industry of an EIS configured around Australia’s contribution to a 2 degrees limit on global warming would reach $128bn over the period 2020 to 2030,” the submission says. “That is a fact germane to the broader national policy debate. At the very least, the independent review should be more transparent about these costs in its final report.” The MCA blasts Finkel’s preliminary report on a range of fronts, declaring it “conspicuously fails to examine the comparable costs of available energy sources” – declaring this “an extraordinary omission for a report of this kind”. The council uses figures dating from 2015 to argue that coal and gas technologies remain the lowest cost to build and operate. It asserts the review ignored the potential contribution of high-efficiency, low-emissions (HELE) coal technologies and ignored the potential of nuclear power. The MCA submission contains new research arguing that electricity networks face significant integration costs as the relative share of wind and solar energy rises – including the requirement to keep backup generation power on standby. The research says the direct subsidies paid by electricity consumers to achieve the large-scale component of the renewable energy target “are estimated at more than $1.8bn in 2016 alone but these subsidies only represent a fraction of the costs of this policy”. The research by the consultancy BAEconomics says integration costs increase significantly as the share of intermittent generation capacity in a power system rises. The MCA argues the costs associated with intermittent capacity should be borne by renewable generators. It also argues the government should provide support “to all energy sources or to none”. It declares that the final Finkel report must make a “clear and unambiguous statement in favour” of a technology-neutral approach to policy support for both CCS and HELE coal technologies – meaning the rules should be changed to allow the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to invest in “clean” coal. The CEFC has said clean coal plants are not financeable in Australia unless the government agrees to indemnify projects against the future risk of a carbon price being introduced, and against the cost of delays prompted by likely community protest action. In its submission to the Finkel review, the CEFC noted there was no new coal-fired capacity among current proposals registered with the Australian Energy Market Operator. “Coal-fired generation tends to be relatively inflexible and not suited to a market with higher levels of renewable energy penetration and declines in daytime demand as a result of rooftop solar generation,” the CEFC said. “While the range of cost estimates for new coal-fired generation capacity are broadly comparable with new renewable energy capacity (excluding any cost for carbon emissions), negative investor perceptions mean that new investment in coal-fired capacity would be unlikely to be financed by Australian or international capital markets. “Investors perceive that new fossil-fuel generation capacity has carbon risk, which is the risk that a new asset would be stranded if a future government were to adopt tighter emissions constraints. “Further, there is arguably no longer a social licence for new coal-fired power stations in Australia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2016/nov/18/africa-tired-being-in-dark-bank-chief-plans-boost-energy-akinwumi-adesina-cop22","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-18T14:07:27Z","webTitle":"‘Africa is tired of being in the dark’: bank chief on plans to boost energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/nov/18/africa-tired-being-in-dark-bank-chief-plans-boost-energy-akinwumi-adesina-cop22","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2016/nov/18/africa-tired-being-in-dark-bank-chief-plans-boost-energy-akinwumi-adesina-cop22","fields":{"headline":"‘Africa is tired of being in the dark’: bank chief on plans to boost energy","bodyText":"“We lose 5% of our potential GDP every year, and African industries cannot be competitive without access to electricity,” says Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank. “I believe that’s why we can’t break away from reliance on exporting our raw materials – new industries will only go to where there’s power.” He is speaking on the sidelines of the COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech, which ends on Friday. Adesina and colleagues from the bank have been using the conference to highlight its new initiatives on energy, including the New Deal on Energy for Africa, which will see $12bn (£9.7bn) invested in the sector over the next five years. “Africa is tired of being in the dark,” he says. The African Development Bank (AfDB) has also created the role of vice-president on power, and been a major player in setting up the African Renewable Energy Initiative, which aims to generate 10GW of power from renewable sources by 2020 and up to 300GW by 2030. “This initiative was the major outcome for Africa of the Paris COP21 meeting last year, where G7 countries contributed $10bn towards it,” says Adesina. Adesina says he is particularly impressed by the strides Morocco has taken to develop its capacity for solar energy. The AfDB was a major investor in the 160MW Noor solar plant at Ouarzazate, which was opened this year. The complex, which uses giant mirrors to reflect the sun’s heat on to liquid that then turns turbines, is being expanded to produce more than 500MW by 2018. Morocco has also recently signed a deal to build 1720MW in new wind farm capacity. “Africa should use what it has and not what it doesn’t have. We have limitless sunshine and great potential for wind, hydro and geothermal,” he says. However, he still believes there is a role for non-renewable sources of energy in Africa. “We need a balanced energy mix. Some African countries have gas and coal, which can be used in a clean way, and they should use it.” Another major challenge is to increase the amount of money spent on climate change adaptation – or helping countries to rebuild systems when they are destroyed by the impacts of climate change. In Africa, for example, governments are coping with floods, extreme temperatures and major droughts in east and southern Africa and the Sahel. Wealthy countries have committed $100bn towards helping poorer states cope with climate change, but one of the major topics on the agenda in Marrakech has been how that money should be divided between adaptation and mitigation. Until now, only 14% of climate funds have gone to adaptation, and Africa, the continent most deeply affected by climate change, has received only 4% of the total green climate funds. “We’ve been short-changed by climate change and we should not be short-changed in financing,” says Adesina. “South Africa has spent $700m this year dealing with the impacts of the drought last year; Mozambique $200m; Namibia $13m. These emergency costs are continuously displacing public expenditure which should be going to health, education and infrastructure development, and endangering macro-economic stability. My view is that we need to increase the amount to be spent on adaptation so that we can spend money on development.” The AfDB is trying to garner support for an African insurance fund. An initiative called the African Risk Capacity Insurance has been launched, but of 32 countries that signed up, only seven have been able to pay the premiums. Adesina says the idea for the insurance fund was welcomed on Wednesday at an African heads of state meeting chaired by Morocco’s King Mohammed VI, and that one way in which climate finance can be better targeted to help African countries is for green climate funds such as the GEF (Global Environment Facility) to start paying the premiums for the African countries. He hopes that this could pave the way for action. “Whenever these drastic climate events like drought, flood or extreme temperature happen, the world has words of comfort for Africa,” says Adesina. “But words of comfort cannot pay the bills and rebuild when problems start.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/jul/02/america-solar-power-workforce-growing-market-solarcity-suniva","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-02T15:00:04Z","webTitle":"A good job if you can get it: America's solar workforce is heating up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/02/america-solar-power-workforce-growing-market-solarcity-suniva","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/02/america-solar-power-workforce-growing-market-solarcity-suniva","fields":{"headline":"A good job if you can get it: America's solar workforce is heating up","bodyText":"Antwain Nelson held various jobs in the construction field for several years, but the work never felt fulfilling. Then an opportunity to volunteer in low-income neighborhoods introduced him to his current job and, he says, a clear career path. “The first day, I fell in love with it,” says Nelson, 25, an installer of solar energy systems and a lifelong resident of Washington DC. The people he works with, he says, feel “like another family to me”. Nelson is one of thousands of new hires in the US solar industry, which has become the fastest growing sector in the energy business. Solar employment has more than doubled since 2010, reaching 209,000 employees by November 2015, according to The Solar Foundation, a nonprofit that offers research and educational programs to promote solar. The industry created about 35,000 of those jobs in 2015 alone. In a report released in November, the foundation projects another 30,000 new jobs through the end of 2016 – a 14.7% annual increase, or 13 times faster than the overall economy. The rise in solar employment comes as jobs in the coal industry are declining sharply. There are reports of some former coal workers transitioning to new jobs in solar. But this may not be possible for the whole sector, as the top coal-producing states have not been hotbeds of solar development. Coal states such as Wyoming, West Virginia and Kentucky don’t even rank among the top 35 states for solar installations over the past two years, according to GTM Research. The top three states with the most solar jobs, from manufacturing to retail, are California, Massachusetts and Nevada, the foundation says. Unsurprisingly, job growth is taking place in states that offer generous rebates and other incentives for producing and installing solar energy equipment. The solar market is largely growing on the backs of workers who hoist solar panels up to roofs to assemble and wire them together. More than half of the solar jobs nationwide involve installation, says Andrea Luecke, the foundation’s executive director. Manufacturing is the second largest job category, which may seem surprising given that the majority of the solar panels being installed in the US come from China. But there has been a rise in domestic manufacturing, which reflects the growing demand from within the US and the impact of the tariffs that the Obama administration imposed on Chinese-made solar panels in recent years. The government put tariffs in place after determining that Chinese manufacturers were selling their products at below fair-market value. The country’s largest solar installer also is becoming a major manufacturer. SolarCity is building what will become the nation’s largest solar panel manufacturing plant in Buffalo, New York. The company expects the new plant, which is set for completion later this year, to create 1,460 new full-time jobs. Other manufacturers with expansion plans include Suniva, which announced plans last September to grow its Norcross, Georgia, panel manufacturing plant and create about 500 new jobs. “The employers that we surveyed were very bullish and said we’ve had a couple of rough years but we’re planning to invest in our workforce and we’re growing,” Luecke says. That growth has come with jobs that offer good pay. Installers earn a median pay of $21 per hour, the foundation says, while factory assemblers earn a median of $18 per hour. Both are above the national median pay of $17.04 per hour for all jobs. But one of the biggest challenges posed to this new and growing market is finding qualified workers. Luecke says solar employers are able to draw workers from a variety of construction and manufacturing fields because they require employees with many of the same basic skills learned in other areas of hands-on work, from oilfield laborers to home builders. Even so, about 20% of employers polled by the foundation said it was “very difficult” to find qualified employees in 2015, a slight increase from the prior year. “What employers are looking for is experience – somebody who has been up on a roof before, has worked with electrical systems before, has been on some kind of construction crew, can follow directions and safety protocol,” she says. Nelson got into solar through a career training program offered by Sasha Bruce Youthwork, a Washington DC nonprofit that helps inner city young people lead more stable lives. In 2014, it brought a group of volunteers to help a project by Grid Alternatives, a nonprofit energy company that builds solar projects for low-income families. After gaining more training through a fellowship from Grid, the nonprofit promoted him to a full-time position on the installation team two months ago. “I feel as though I’m headed down a good path, and it’s fun,” says Nelson. “Being able to put solar on another person’s roof is great, because you’re saving them money. I love the mission.” Some employers also actively recruit military veterans, knowing that there has been a flood of them entering the workforce after America’s long military interventions in the Middle East. One of those is Sam Gulland, who was a captain in the 75th Ranger Regiment in the Army and served two tours in Afghanistan before leaving the military last December. A Princeton University graduate with a degree in public policy and international affairs, Gulland started talking to friends about their plans after military service, and many were interested in alternative energy. “I think vets are drawn to it because they come from work that carries lots of meaning,” Gulland says. “In general, I think clean energy carries that same kind of meaning. At some point, fossil fuels will run out. Global warming, if we don’t do something about it, could kill millions of people.” Gulland found the US Department of Energy’s Solar Ready Vets program, which connects veterans with jobs in the solar industry, and the research led him to Grid Alternatives, where he began volunteering. That was how Gulland recently found himself working alongside Nelson to install a solar energy system at a home in Washington DC in May this year. Gulland helped unload solar panels from a truck and tested the panels to ensure they produce the proper voltage before they go up onto the roof. Gulland, who is is mulling over his career move, says he’s interested in solar project development and financing. He’s currently a fellow with the Clean Energy Leadership Institute, a DC-based nonprofit that teaches about energy markets and policy analysis. It is still uncertain how long the solar employment boom will last because the industry heavily depends on government tax incentives to thrive. Congress recently extended a key tax credit for another five years, a move that provides near-term assurance to solar employers. But politics are as shifty as economics, and there are no guarantees. SolarCity and its major competitor, Sunrun, recently stopped selling and installing solar in Nevada when the state increased the fees that homeowners will have to pay to put solar panels on their roofs. Luecke says she expects solar employment to plateau within the next 10 to 20 years, partly because installers and manufacturers will become more efficient to keep costs down as they gain more experience in the market. In the meantime, there is still a lot of opportunity for growth, she says, because solar generation only accounts for 1% of America’s electricity market. “Our growth rates are high because we’re starting from a small base,” she notes. “We’re going to become more automated, using more snap-on technology, using more robotics in manufacturing. The growth will then be a lot more tempered.” The article was amended on 6 July 2016 to show that Sam Gulland is a fellow at the Clean Energy Leadership Institute. An earlier version of the story said Sam Gulland was thinking about applying for the fellowship."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2017/jan/06/inside-glanrhyd-the-first-solar-eco-hamlet-in-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-06T07:00:12Z","webTitle":"Inside Glanrhyd, the first solar 'eco hamlet' in Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/06/inside-glanrhyd-the-first-solar-eco-hamlet-in-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jan/06/inside-glanrhyd-the-first-solar-eco-hamlet-in-wales","fields":{"headline":"Inside Glanrhyd, the first solar 'eco hamlet' in Wales","bodyText":"Most of the houses in the Welsh village of Glanrhyd are of traditional construction – walls made out of hefty local stone, roofs of grey slate. They can get chilly when the winter winds whistle through the gaps. The six houses that make up the “eco hamlet” of Pentre Solar look and feel very different. They are built using light, bright timber sourced from a nearby valley. The houses are carefully insulated, airtight and powered by solar panels. Over the next few weeks the first tenants, local people from Pembrokeshire county council’s housing list, will move into what is being billed as the only development of its kind in the UK. Their fuel bills are expected to be a fraction of their neighbours’ – and they will even get the use of a shared electric car for the school run, the shopping trip to nearby Cardigan, or even for a jolly to one of the many glorious local beaches. “We are delighted with how it has turned out,” said Glen Peters, CEO of Western Solar, the company behind the scheme. “We can’t wait for people to come and start living here.” If the project, which has been backed by the Welsh government, does work, the hope is that similar developments could be rolled out across Wales and eventually across the UK. Western Solar’s first venture was a solar farm, five miles from the eco hamlet. Doubts that it was sunny enough in this part of the British Isles (after all, the nearby village of Eglwyswrw made headlines last year after it rained for more than 80 days in a row) proved unfounded and the project thrived. Peters began to think about the number of people living in fuel poverty – according to the latest UK government figures, 10% of households in England alone cannot afford to heat their homes – and remembered his own chilly childhood in south London when he and his immigrant parents shivered in front of an inadequate one-bar heater. Using technology borrowed from Germany, Western Solar built a prototype eco home called Tŷ Solar (Tŷ is Welsh for house). The idea was to produce a high-quality, brilliantly insulated, airtight house made of locally sourced timber and powered by solar energy. They liked the results and expected investors to be as excited as they were. When the investors failed to show, the company decided to build its own “solar hamlet” to showcase its ideas. It found an abandoned cowshed and was given a grant of £141,000 by the Welsh government to help turn it into a factory. Wood for the houses, larch and Douglas fir, was sourced from the Gwaun Valley and local people were hired and trained to build the homes. About 40% of the fabric of the houses is made in the factory; it takes a week to make each one and four or five days to erect it. Corners have not been cut. When the company was sourcing interior doors, its workers refused to countenance the idea of them being made of rainforest timber. “They said they would make them themselves and did – out of local Douglas fir,” said Peters. Using local materials and local labour is important. The company says every pound it spends stays in the local economy. The houses cost around £100,000 to build, which Peters says is comparable to a conventional build. A brownfield site – an old garage – was found and Pentre Solar (pentre means village) took shape. Peters said the solar panels would reduce power bills from the UK average of £1,300 a year to more like £200. “On the most grizzly winter’s day, they will have to draw power from the grid,” said Peters. It all means the houses are in high demand. Four of them have “affordable” rents and are being offered to people on Pembrokeshire county council’s housing register who have lived in the area for five years. Property can be hard to find here because so many houses have been bought up by wealthy outsiders as holiday homes. Would-be tenants can expect stringent interviews. As well as the normal financial and background checks, they have to show they buy into the ethos of the development. “These are high-performance houses,” said Peters. “You can’t just knock a hole in a wall if you feel like it – or put in a cat flap for that matter.” Western Solar’s ambitious plan is to build 1,000 more houses across the UK in the next 10 years and is looking for investors to help. The Welsh government is keen to see the concept work elsewhere. One of the key pledges of the current Labour-led administration is to provide an additional 20,000 affordable homes by 2021. After officially cutting the ribbon to open Pentre Solar on Thursday, Lesley Griffiths, the cabinet secretary for environment and rural affairs, said: “This scheme ticks so many boxes. We need more houses, we need more energy efficiency, we want to help people with fuel poverty. It’s been really good to hear how they have sourced local products. It’s great they’re using local people to build the houses.” Paul Oxborrow is one of the local young men who has become a proficient carpenter by working on the Pentre Solar homes. “It’s been brilliant,” he said. “We’ve all learned so much and the houses look great. They’re good for the people who live in them and good for the environment. I’d love to live in one.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/feb/15/trump-science-adviser-william-happer-climate-change-cult","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T13:13:33Z","webTitle":"Trump's likely science adviser calls climate scientists 'glassy-eyed cult'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/15/trump-science-adviser-william-happer-climate-change-cult","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/feb/15/trump-science-adviser-william-happer-climate-change-cult","fields":{"headline":"Trump's likely science adviser calls climate scientists 'glassy-eyed cult'","bodyText":"The man tipped as frontrunner for the role of science adviser to Donald Trump has described climate scientists as “a glassy-eyed cult” in the throes of a form of collective madness. William Happer, an eminent physicist at Princeton University, met Trump last month to discuss the post and says that if he were offered the job he would take it. Happer is highly regarded in the academic community, but many would view his appointment as a further blow to the prospects of concerted international action on climate change. “There’s a whole area of climate so-called science that is really more like a cult,” Happer told the Guardian. “It’s like Hare Krishna or something like that. They’re glassy-eyed and they chant. It will potentially harm the image of all science.” Trump has previously described global warming as “very expensive … bullshit” and has signalled a continued hardline stance since taking power. He has nominated the former Texas governor Rick Perry, a staunch climate sceptic, as secretary of energy and hopes to put the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) under the leadership of Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, who has been one of the agency’s most hostile critics. John Holdren, Barack Obama’s science adviser, said Happer’s outspoken opinions would be a “substantial handicap” for a job that has traditionally involved delivering mainstream scientific opinion to the heart of policymaking. “Every national academy of science agrees that the science is solid, that climate change is real,” he said. “To call this a cult is absurd and … an insult to the people who have done this work.” Happer also supports a controversial crackdown on the freedom of federal agency scientists to speak out about their findings, arguing that mixed messages on issues such as whether butter or margarine is healthier, have led to people disregarding all public health information. “So many people are fed up of listening to the government lie to them about margarine and climate change that when something is actually true and beneficial they don’t listen,” he said, citing childhood vaccines as an example. “The government should have a reputation of being completely reliable about facts – real facts.” Happer dismissed concerns that Trump is “anti-science”, saying he had a positive impression of the president during their January meeting. “He asked good questions – he was very attentive, actually,” he said. Climate change was mentioned but was not the main focus of discussions, according to Happer, who revealed that Trump had expressed support for solar energy in areas like Arizona “where it makes sense”. “His comments were that of a technically literate person,” he said. “He wasn’t ideologically opposed to renewables; he wasn’t ideologically in favour of them either.” Unlike many of his scientific peers, Happer is in favour of contentious legislation aimed at reining in the ability of federal agency staff to hold press conferences, give television interviews and promote their findings on official websites. The “Secret Science Reform Bill”, which is being pushed by the Texas Republican Lamar Smith, chairman of the House science, space and technology Committee, would require federal agencies to publish all the raw data underpinning any proposed regulations and for new findings to be scrutinised extensively by outside experts before being announced. However, critics view the bill as an attempt to strip federal agencies of autonomy and reduce their regulatory powers. “There is this special need for government science to be especially clean and without fault,” said Happer. “It’s OK to have press conferences, but before you do that you should have the findings carefully vetted.” When asked for examples of where the current vetting process has failed, Happer cited a recent controversy surrounding a high-profile paper published by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) scientists showing that global surface temperatures had risen again after temporarily levelling off. Earlier this month, a retired Noaa scientist, John Bates, accused his former colleagues of rushing out the paper ahead of the UN conference, prioritising political impact over scientific rigour – although Bates later clarified that he had an issue with timing and transparency rather than “tampering with data”. “This disappearance of the hiatus in global warming, which was trotted out just before the [UN] Paris conference … it was clearly just a political fanfare,” said Happer. “We shouldn’t be doing that. They were fiddling with the temperature records to make the hiatus go away.” Happer argues that climate monitoring, such as the collection of CO2 and atmospheric temperature data, is valuable and should be continued. However, he claims that the overall threat posed by global warming has been overplayed by scientists swayed by a political agenda and power-hungry civil servants. “There’s a huge amount of money that we spend on saving the planet,” he said. “If it turns out that the planet doesn’t need saving as much as we thought, well, there are other ways you could spend the money. “When you talk about fossil fuel companies being motivated, well, there’s nobody more motivated than the people working for the federal government,” he added. “You can’t rise in the American bureaucracy without some threat to address.” However, Holdren said that the evidence that human activity is causing global warming – a view supported by 97% of active climate researchers – is compelling. “It is clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that humans are causing climate change,” he added. Happer said he began to question the emerging consensus view on climate change while working as director of research at the Department of Energy in 1991-93 as part of the George HW Bush administration. Climate scientists would “grudgingly” present their work to administrators, he claims, while those in other fields would share their results with enthusiasm. “I would ask questions but they were evasive and wouldn’t answer,” he said. “This experience really soured me on the community. I started reading up and I realised why they weren’t answering the questions: because they didn’t have good answers. It was really at that point that I began to get seriously worried about climate as a science.” Concerns about the Trump administration’s apparent disregard for mainstream scientific thinking on climate change has triggered a wave of activism, including plans for a science march in various cities. However, Happer said that the public, who may view scientists as part of a privileged elite, may be less sympathetic. “There’s a potential downside [to the march] of them being seen as a greedy bunch of spoiled people,” he said. “I don’t think they’re that way myself, but it could be easily twisted into that kind of narrative.” David Gelernter, a Yale computer scientist who has also questioned the reality of manmade climate change, is also reported to be in the running for the role of science adviser, but was not available for interview. • This article was amended on 17 February 2017.

But injury struck and Stapleton never made it. His coach told him that he had two options – waste time feeling sorry for himself, or start training for the next season. Stapleton, who was speaking at the Guardian’s Confessions of a Small Business seminar, went on to found the New Covent Garden soup company, which pioneered the idea of fresh, chilled ready-made soups, and Little Dish, which offers healthy ready meals for children. His favourite quote, he said, is from former American football player Lou Holtz: “Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and I’ll show you someone who has overcome adversity.” But Stapleton has his own spin: “If you don’t experience adversity, you’re not putting yourself out there enough.” The event was an opportunity for small business owners to share what they had learned from setbacks along the way. For Stapleton, a strong belief in your product was key to its success: food industry experts had told him that chilled soup was unworkable and might kill someone – soups had to be sterilised. Ignorance of the scale of the challenge can sometimes be bliss, he added: “You can be halfway up the mountain before you realise what the challenges are.” Stapleton’s keynote speech was followed by a panel discussion by the owners of three very different businesses: Joanna Montgomery, who founded Little Riot, which makes Pillow Talk wristbands; Nick Edwards, founder of software company Papaya Resources; and Arpana Gandhi, who founded Disarmco, a company that has developed a safe way of disposing of landmines and other unexploded ordnance (explosive weapons). Each had faced setbacks that could have ended their business. For Edwards, whose company makes software for the food industry, the setback came in the form of human tragedy. In 2012, on the verge of signing an important legal agreement, his key developer was killed in a hit-and-run accident. Edwards, who knew little about how the product worked, decided to start again and formed a partnership with a large food manufacturer to make sure the platform met the needs of users. He learned not to rely on a single developer – he now has four. Terrible though the tragedy was, it gave him focus: “It really did shape where I wanted to take the business and now we supply quite a number of the food manufacturers in the UK.” Gandhi’s journey to bring her Dragon Torch product to market has been a long, uphill struggle. Her business partner John Reid, who invented the product, died in 2014. “The whole process almost had to start again,” said Gandhi. “We had to find another innovator, who would believe [in it], to pick up the pieces and go along with the business.” But investors weren’t interested in taking a risk on a product that might, in their view, not work. The proposition wasn’t helped by the case of businessman Gary Bolton, who was jailed in 2013 for selling fake bomb detectors. Gandhi’s decision to put £150,000 of her own money into the business did nothing to give investors confidence, so she went to crowdfunding company CrowdCube to raise a further £150,000. She was encouraged by the messages of support she received. “There comes a point in business life where you just think everything is against you,” she said. “But then something comes along to give you a little bit more hope and that’s exactly what you hang on to, and you want to fight another day.” Joanna Montgomery’s experience with crowdfunding was less successful. After five years of research and development, she used Kickstarter to raise funding for Pillow Talk, a product that transmits the sound of the user’s heartbeat, in real time, to their partner. The company quickly reached its target, but Kickstarter experienced a glitch that resulted in the business being able to collect only 60% of the money it had raised. Montgomery said there were times when she felt like quitting, but was motivated to keep going by the response she had. “Every time I thought maybe this is not going to work, I’d get another email from a retailer saying, ‘Can we place a wholesale order?’, or just another ordinary person telling me their husband is in the military and how it would add value to their lives,” she said. Two audience members shared stories of facing sudden downturns. One, Aidan Bell, had set up a solar energy business with a friend that within three years had 300 staff and was turning over £8m a month. When business stopped coming in as a result of a change to government plans, they limited the number of people they made redundant to 100 because they were “emotionally tied” to staff. Since then, Bell has set up EnviroBuild, which is a “bit leaner” and makes greater use of outsourcing rather than relying on payroll staff. Another audience member lost a customer who provided 50% of their company’s business. “We were devastated,” she said. But it worked out: “It was good for us as we had to fight back and we grew the business back up.” That customer has now returned – but provides only 5% of the business: “We declared we would not have one company we were that dependent on again.” Panelists admitted that one of the hardest things to do was knowing when to listen to other people. Montgomery said that she had often been offered conflicting advice, but had concluded that “the kind of people I want around me are those who give me advice, but then let me make my own decisions”. Because Edwards’s product covers multiple areas such as safety and HR, he has recently brought in “some key people that look after those areas. If I don’t listen to them, it’s going to be really pointless”. For Gandhi, the technical nature of her business made taking advice an imperative: “The bomb disposal experts and I have a rule of thumb. I don’t pick up a screwdriver and they don’t pick up a spreadsheet. It works very well.” While many of the topics covered practical aspects of dealing with failure, all the speakers emphasised the psychological importance of self-belief and trusting your instincts. The last word goes to Stapleton: “You need to love what you’re doing. If you don’t love what you’re doing, you’re more than likely going to fail.” Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/sep/08/energy-companies-call-on-mps-to-save-australias-renewables-agency-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-07T20:10:30Z","webTitle":"Energy companies call on MPs to save Australia's renewables agency funding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/08/energy-companies-call-on-mps-to-save-australias-renewables-agency-funding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/08/energy-companies-call-on-mps-to-save-australias-renewables-agency-funding","fields":{"headline":"Energy companies call on MPs to save Australia's renewables agency funding","bodyText":"Some of Australia’s best-known energy companies including AGL, GE and Tesla, have joined calls to halt plans to cut $1.3bn from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The 24 companies signed an open letter to parliamentarians released by the Clean Energy Council. The Coalition has introduced its “omnibus” savings bill, which wraps up savings that both major parties claimed in their election costings. It includes a $1.3bn cut to Arena, which removes its future grant-making ability, essentially abolishing the agency. “The implications of substantial cuts to Arena would be profound,” the signatories said in the letter released on Thursday. Businesses have only recently regained confidence to invest in renewable energy, they said, following the “challenging period of political instability and policy change”. “Investment is flooding back into the sector as stability returns and the fundamentals of clean energy investment start to shine through,” they wrote. “Investment confidence would be again undermined if one of the first moves of the new parliament is to cut funding to Australia’s key clean energy agency. This would damage Australia’s reputation and unsettle investors, again. The supply chains and skills that have been established could be lost and would be very difficult and expensive to redevelop again in the future.” “Clean energy is one of Australia’s best opportunities for jobs, growth and innovation. Arena’s ability to deliver new grant programs is at risk with legislation before the Australian parliament that would substantially cut its future funding. While we respect the fiscal challenges facing the government and the nation, we believe that cutting Arena’s budget would be shortsighted.” The signatories include AGL, GE, Tesla, engineering company ABB, Vestas, Goldwind, Pacific Hydro, Suntrix, Conergy, First Solar and Infigen Energy. Kane Thornton, chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, said the grant funding from Arena had helped bring down the cost of renewable energy and storage, and leveraged hundreds of millions of dollars in private investment. “Hundreds of projects have been funded to date, and hundreds more are needed if we are to transform Australia’s energy system at the lowest possible cost to consumers,” Thornton said. The Guardian revealed last week the threat of cuts to Arena has already caused at least two renewable energy projects to be suspended – one in New South Wales and one in Western Australia. Analysis from the Australian Conservation Foundation suggested the cuts threatened more than 5,100 jobs, with a majority of those in Queensland. The open letter follows another from 190 solar researchers, calling on all political parties to support Arena. “If Arena is debilitated then hundreds of people would lose their jobs within a year or two,” the researchers said. “In the longer term, Australia’s leadership in solar energy would vanish. This would be completely at odds with the government’s innovation agenda and its commitment at the Paris climate conference…” Although Labor accepted the cuts to Arena, and banked the savings in its election costings, it has indicated it might oppose the measure since it does not include an extra $300m for renewable energy projects that Labor also took to the election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/aug/25/electricity-storage-underground-quidnet-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-25T19:00:19Z","webTitle":"A Texas startup's big energy idea: storing electricity underground","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/25/electricity-storage-underground-quidnet-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/25/electricity-storage-underground-quidnet-energy","fields":{"headline":"A Texas startup's big energy idea: storing electricity underground","bodyText":"In a field in Central Texas, Aaron Mandell and his crew are running pumping equipment to bring a former oil and gas well back to life. But they’re not trying to extract black gold. Instead, they are developing a way to turn abandoned oil and gas wells into vaults for storing electricity. The concept behind Mandell’s startup, Quidnet Energy, sounds simple: pumping water deep into the earth to fill up the cracks in-between rocks that previously held fossil fuels. When the pressurized water is released, it acts like a spring as it races through a turbine-generator above ground, powering it to produce electricity. Mandell, co-founder and chairman of Quidnet, is part of a growing number of entrepreneurs in an emerging market to use batteries or other technologies to bank electricity when prices and demand are low, and discharge it when they are high. The US market installed 221 megawatts of energy storage projects in 2015, up from the 65 megawatts added in 2014, according to GTM Research. The market research firm expects the annual installation to exceed 1 gigawatt in 2019. The energy storage market is growing fast primarily because of the increasing amount of solar and wind energy being produced across the country, from rooftop solar panels to acres of wind turbines. Storing solar and wind energy for later use circumvents a big disadvantage of these two types of low-carbon energy: they can’t always produce electricity whenever needed because demand fluctuates, reaching a peak in the early evening when people return home and turn on appliances or during hot summer months. Utilities in states with more renewable energy are starting to pay for energy storage services or build their own. Just last week, AES Energy Storage said it will build two giant lithium-ion battery systems for San Diego Gas and Electric in California, which is the biggest solar energy state in the country. “Our goal is to allow renewables like solar and wind to penetrate the power market at much larger percentages than we have today,” Mandell said. Quidnet recently lined up a new round of venture capital, bringing the total amount they have raised to just over $1m. The company previously snagged a seed funding of $500,000 from Clean Energy Venture Group. Quidnet’s other investors include Will and Jada Smith Foundation and the Sorenson Impact Foundation, both of which invested through Prime, a nonprofit advising foundations that want to put money into technology, which isn’t a familiar territory for philanthropic organizations. Quidnet’s investors are betting on what they believe will be a cheaper alternative to lithium-ion batteries, which have dominated the energy storage projects in recent years, said Daniel Goldman, co-founder and managing director at Clean Energy Venture Group, the Quidnet investor. “We view Quidnet as solving one of the most important challenges – enabling renewable resources such as wind and solar to penetrate the market while accomplishing an important goal of maintaining grid stability,” Goldman said. Quidnet plans to build and operate energy storage projects for power plant owners, utilities and industrial companies. The company’s technology is similar to a widely used and cheaper energy storage setup that pumps water from a dam to an upstream reservoir when electricity prices are low. During peak times when electricity is more expensive, the water is drained back down to run through a turbine to generate power. Instead of an above-ground reservoir, Quidnet stores water underground. The company launched a pilot project this past year in Erath County, Texas, to demonstrate the concept. Mandell and his co-founder Howard Schmidt, an engineer with oil company Saudi Aramco, used an abandoned natural gas well, which runs 2,800 feet deep, into a reservoir that could hold 50k gallons of water. The project showed that after pumping water into the well for 12 hours, their technology could generate six hours of electricity. Quidnet’s idea is so unusual that it still needs to overcome some technical challenges to make it feasible for a well-run, large scale energy storage operation. “In theory, this idea can be helpful,” said Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and director of its atmosphere and energy program. “The technology should work so long as the reservoir does not leak and so long as the outflow can be controlled and is fast enough.” Choosing well-sealed underground reservoirs to prevent the pressurized water from leaking is one of Quidnet’s biggest concerns. Mandell said the pilot project recorded far lower water losses than anticipated: 1% of the water per week instead of per day. “We were impressed with the team and ‘pumped hydro’ concept using geologic reservoirs,” said Goldman. Next, Quidnet plans to run another pilot project, this time at an old geothermal well in northern Nevada. The well is 14 inches in diameter, larger than a typical oil and gas well, making it possible to inject a higher volume of water – and generating more power faster – at any time. The reservoir can hold up to 85k barrels of water, and produce 10 hours of electricity following a 14-hour charge. The new pilot project will store electricity from a geothermal power plant in Nevada run by AltaRock Energy, where Mandell is also CEO. The power plant sells electricity to NV Energy, the largest utility in Nevada. Nevada is a good place to be for energy storage service companies. Nevada, along with other Western states like Oregon and Idaho, recently joined the California Independent System Operator (Caiso), which manages the wholesale electricity market in the state. As part of the deal, the member states will receive excess solar energy from California, which they can store and use to provide round-the-clock clean electricity, said Mandell. Ultimately, Quidnet hopes to build its own wells in locations with a high demand for energy storage. Each of its projects will operate up to 20 wells, with each well measuring between 1000-5000 feet deep and capable of storing 35 megawatt hours of energy. The company is also working on software to automating a storage project’s operation so that a project owner can run it remotely. An energy storage project could be measured in watts or watt-hours, depending on what information a project owner wants to convey. The term “watts” (a megawatt is a million watts) denotes how fast power can be charged or discharged at any time. A watt-hour refers to the amount of energy that can be stored or released in a given hour. The cost of building each well varies by depth, said Mandell, and Quidnet aims to build a project at $50 per kilowatt-hour of energy, a cost that will include the well, turbine generator, planning and securing permits. What’s not included is the cost of drilling exploratory wells to identify the proper underground geology for storing water. “Fortunately, the oil, gas and geothermal industries have already done this exploration work for us – there are hundreds of thousands of wells drilled all over the country that we’ll use to tell us exactly where to install storage,” he said."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2017/feb/13/global-water-crisis-innovation-solution","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T09:51:35Z","webTitle":"Could these five innovations help solve the global water crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/feb/13/global-water-crisis-innovation-solution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/feb/13/global-water-crisis-innovation-solution","fields":{"headline":"Could these five innovations help solve the global water crisis?","bodyText":"The global water crisis has many causes, requiring many different solutions. As 1.2 billion people live in areas of water scarcity, these solutions must span policy, technology, and behaviour change to make a real difference. A number of technological innovations address the crisis in novel ways. We asked two water experts – Vincent Casey, senior water and sanitation adviser at WaterAid, and Hannah Safford, an energy and environmental policy analyst – to assess some of the most creative approaches. Drinkable Book In partnership with non-profit Water is Life, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University developed this education and filtration tool. Each page of the book provides basic water and sanitation advice, such as the importance of keeping contaminants like rubbish and faeces away from water, often unknown in developing countries. Perhaps more novel is that the advice is printed on “scientific coffee filter” paper that can be used to purify drinking water and reduce 99.9% of bacteria. Each book has enough filtration sheets to provide its reader with clean water for four years. It’s being distributed in Ghana, Kenya, Haiti, Ethiopia, India and Tanzania, and a Farsi version of the book is in development. Casey: Many different filter products will purify water and remove pathogens, but it needs to have a demand from users. It also needs to be affordable [in the local context] or come with some credit mechanism. Filters play a crucial role in making the water safe, but if you’re not blocking other routes of transmission (eg flies on food, handwashing after toilet use) you will still have problems. In other words, any filter has to be part of a combined solution. WaterSeer It looks like a well, but instead of withdrawing groundwater, the WaterSeer uses the surrounding environment to extract water from the atmosphere. It is planted six feet below the surface, where its lower chamber is surrounded by cool earth. Above ground, wind spins a turbine which spins fan blades inside the device. These blades send the air into an internal condensation chamber where, as the warm air cools, the vapour condenses on the sides of the chamber. Water then flows down to the lower chamber and can be extracted with a simple pump and hose. In ideal conditions, it can collect 37 litres of water a day. Developed by VICI labs in the US, the project is being tested by the National Peace Corps Association and will be piloted later this year. Casey: If we take sub-Saharan Africa as an example, groundwater tends to be available in most places we work – about 20m below the surface. So it’s a management or infrastructure problem that prevents people accessing water, not a lack of it. It’s not really about fixing the problem with technology; it’s about fixing the system. With this example, I would imagine there could be problem with vandalism, as the device seems quite fragile. However, that’s not to say that technology is not part of the solution – it has a role, but it’s makes up 20% of the whole picture, along with policy and management. Graphene filters Desalination, converting saltwater into freshwater, has historically been too expensive and energy-intensive to serve as a widespread solution for improving access. However, Lockheed Martin has developed and patented a Perforene graphene filter which it claims would reduce the energy cost of conventional reverse osmosis desalination by 20%, while withstanding higher pressure and temperatures. The perforated, hyper-permeable filter is one atom thick and is said to improve the flow of water compared to conventional methods by 500%. While the technology would be hugely beneficial to the oil and gas sector, which reportedly produces 18bn gallons of wastewater each year, the company is also researching other applications for the technology, including in food and energy generation. Safford: Desalination should only be used as a last resort. Emphasis should be placed on smart water management, reducing water losses, and increasing the uptake of water-efficient technologies practices. But in regions where there is truly not enough freshwater to meet demand, a cheaper and less energy-intensive desalination method is certainly a good thing. Fog catchers Vast mesh nets capture moisture from fog, which drips into collection trays after condensation. The largest of these projects is on the slopes of Mount Boutmezguida, a microclimate in Morocco where 6,300 litres of water can be harvested per day. The water is clean, free and instant, which is perhaps why Dar Si Hmad – the non-profit responsible for the project –was awarded the UN’s 2016 Momentum for Change award. First developed in South America, fog catching systems also exist in Chile, Peru, Ghana, Eritrea, South Africa and California. Safford: Fog catching could provide a sustainable supply of drinking water for small communities in water-scarce regions, but it is unlikely to generate enough water to significantly increase water supplies. The Mount Boutmezguida project only generates enough water to serve about 160 people per day – a project of a similar size in a developed country would serve a smaller number of people [due to higher consumption habits]. Solar crop In hot and dry climates, many farmers pump groundwater to irrigate crops, and there has been a growth in the use of solar-powered pumps. A problem arises when farmers view solar energy as free, as it can cause over-irrigation. A part-technological, part policy and management solution by CGIAR’s research programme on water, land and ecosystems, and in partnership with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), incentivises farmers using solar pumps to sell excess power back to the grid. The guaranteed buy-back scheme produces a “triple win”; farmers gain income, the state gains electricity reserves, and the water source is conserved by curbing usage – all while reducing carbon emissions. The scheme is being piloted in Gujarat, and IWMI estimates that solarising India’s 20m irrigation wells could reduce carbon emissions by 4-5% per year. Casey: A good initiative addressing a serious problem through changes to policy and management, not just focusing on a technical solution. In addition, selling electricity back to the grid could generate revenue to conduct maintenance on these pumps – a good sign for the sustainability of the arrangement. What have we missed?

But there is no rest for the wicked, so check back on the Guardian tomorrow, where we will have all the information on what is happening with the medevac report, the press freedom inquiry, and the Liberal party council, which is being held this weekend.

And please – take care of you. Siggghh Helen Davidson also had this story today: An Afghan doctor who was transferred to Australia from Manus Island for medical care has died in Brisbane. Sayed Mirwais Rohani had been in Australia for around two years, after more than four years on Manus Island. The 32-year-old Hazara man is believed to have taken his own life, and is the 13th death of a person sent to Manus Island or Nauru by Australia under its offshore immigration system. Rohani’s father is a refugee living in the UK with his wife, and he travelled to Manus Island in 2016 seeking his son’s release to join him in the UK. The spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition, Ian Rintoul, said that request was denied because Rohani was not a minor. • Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14;Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78 Arthur Sinodinos, who is doing his farewell tour across the parliament (he’s off to Washington), was asked by Patricia Karvelas what message his colleagues should take from his valedictory speech yesterday: Look, ultimately it’s up to people what messages they take out of it. I think that is a message. I think one of the other messages is that ultimately this is a team game. And you have to accept in politics you can’t always do what you want, even as a backbencher. You’re part of a team and government only works if it’s a team. There will also be a lot of media bigwigs in Canberra tomorrow – the media freedom inquiry will hold a public hearing. The medevac senate report is due to be handed down tomorrow. Amanda Stoker led the committee, which is government heavy, so I think we can assume it is going to recommend the legislation be repealed. Labor and the Greens are expected to enter in dissenting reports. Then, when the senate returns in November, it will all be up to Jacqui Lambie. In the meantime, Helen Davidson had this story: The Australian Border Force transferred a seriously mentally ill man to Perth from Melbourne, where a youth mental health facility was preparing to treat him – then took almost a month to bring him back. On Tuesday, after being flown 2,700km across the country, admitted to hospital emergency or psychiatric departments six times, held in various forms of detention, then flying another 2,700km, the young man was finally taken to the facility that had originally offered to treat him. The shock early-morning transfer from the Melbourne detention centre, Mita, to Perth, was on a commercial Qantas flight – just one day after the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, proclaimed that the company would not be silent on social issues. The young asylum seeker was removed from the Melbourne detention centre in the early hours of 19 September, allegedly without warning and without consulting the external health professionals who were arranging to have him readmitted to the Melbourne facility. No reason for the transfer was given, as far as Guardian Australia is aware. This is not a sight you will see too often – an LNP senator sitting with the crossbench, against the government. Susan McDonald chaired the committee that recommended the additional maintenance requirements be removed from charity flight operators – which is what Rex Patrick is calling for. Labor voted with the government. And from this, I think you can infer from this answer on the voice to parliament, Ken Wyatt has set out that the government will be pushing to legislate, before heading to the referendum Patricia Karvelas: You do know you’ll break a lot of hearts by not putting the voice to the people? Ken Wyatt: We also have to be pragmatic and that’s a reality. PK: But do you acknowledge you’re going to break a lot of people’s hearts? KW: Some people have told me it will break their hearts. We have to think about whether we want to be recognised in the Constitution. PK: What’s the point of recognition without power, Senator? KW: Recognition was in section 127 in the Constitution but in the sense of not allowing us to be counted. 127 was struck out. The 1967 referendum created a number of myths around what it really meant to people. The reality was, was the striking out of that and then the amendment, the 51-26. This requires further work on what are the sets of words that recognise this within the Constitution. 51-26 has been predominantly used for Indigenous Australians to support Commonwealth legislation on very critical issues such as the Mabo decision, land rights, etc ... What I don’t want to see is that removed totally which then leaves a challenge in terms of the legitimacy of those. PK: Would you like to see it changed? KW: I’m going to wait to see what comes out. I’ve been meeting with people and there is a degree of willingness to have recognition. I think that once we work through whatever the voice is, and that may give us another option. What I suspect will happen is that we may legislate first and then when that’s successful, then we can go back for the next bite of the Constitution. On the legislated voice issue, Ken Wyatt says he is pushing ahead: Well, we’ve got a timetable I’m proposing to take to the PM. Once that’s been agreed to in the process that he and I will undertake, and my cabinet colleagues and certainly members of parliament, then we will announce that and we will clearly lay out the process and the structures that are within that. Patricia Karvelas: What about if people don’t want a legislated voice? KW: I suspect that if we went with a nebulous notion of a voice to the greater Australian public, it would not have the support. Constitutional recognition, with the exception of John Howard’s referendum, tends not to come back as a question to be put at a later stage. Local government is slightly different because people have fought to try and get local government recognised in the constitution and we’ve had parliamentary committees deal with that. But I don’t want to see us lose an opportunity. And that’s what we’ve got to do, do it very steadily. I don’t want this to be rushed that we get it wrong and that we lose it. When I look at the referendums that have been successful, Labor was successful with one on social services. That’s because Bob Menzies is the leader and did not oppose what Labor had done to the Australian public. In a sense there was this bipartisan support. But you need both sides to the political divide. PK: What process have you gone through now to get Labor on board? It is meant to be bipartisan. KW: I’m having dinner with my colleagues on an evening that we have chosen next week – the Indigenous members of the parliament who are predominantly Labor. PK: In terms of the timeline, I know you’re taking this to the PM, can you give me an indication of the kind of timeframe that you think is workable. KW: It is before the next election because we don’t a referendum tied in with an election. There is an unintended consequence of that we don’t need. It’s important we have this pristine space in which the question can be put, the debate’s had andAustralians make the decision. PK: You think you can have a referendum on recognition before the next election? KW: I’m optimistic. Patricia Karvelas: Many Indigenous people are opposed to this idea of legislating the voice. Have you convinced them? Ken Wyatt: No. I haven’t. But we will start a process. I’ve been talking to a lot of people as I’ve moved across the nation. Issues like sovereignty come up. Communities say, “Who will listen to our voice? We want local issues and access to health, better education.” I think Linda Burney discovered that when she travelled from Port Hedland to Uluru because I saw her and she made the very pertinent point – they were concerned about local matters that needed resolving. PK: In terms of a proposal for changing the Constitution, you’ve made it quite clear to the disappointment of many that you don’t want the voice to be in the Constitution. So what will constitutional change look like under the Morrison Government? KW: We will work through those over the next 12 months. PK: Can you give me some parameters? KW: There will be recognition. PK: What will that look like? KW: That will need to be worked through with our people. And has to be acceptable within a legal framework. What I don’t want is a section 44 issue being created. We have to be pragmatic and have many non-Indigenous Australians who are supportive but are saying, “I’m concerned until you tell us what the sets of words are because I’m not going to commit to something that creates a division between a nation that is becoming more unified.” The number of non-indigenous people who have said, “We will stand with Indigenous Australians. We want to see them recognised but get the words right.” On the ABC, Patricia Karvelas has an interview with Ken Wyatt about where the plan for Indigenous reconciliation is at. We will announce in the very near future a working group that will define the voice but will take in to consideration local, regional, state and national approaches. One of the things I’ve made very clear to state and territory ministers is they already have voices ... I don’t want to take them out of the equation. There will be a substantial piece of work that will be undertaken and as soon as I finalise it, crossing a couple of Ts and dotting some Is then we’ll start the process. PK: My understanding is you’re about to take that proposal to the PM. Can you give me an indication of what is in that proposal? KW: I can’t do that until I’ve had a discussion with my leader. PK: Am I right you are about to take a proposal to the PM for a way forward on legislation to actually establish a voice in this term of parliament? KW: What I’ll be doing is taking forward a series of propositions to do with constitutional recognition, the voice and truth telling. Each of those are separate pieces of work because they are critical in their own right. But what I also want to do is talk about the way in which government will take elements of that forward as we co-design. I’m seriously committed to working through with our people to a solution that they’re comfortable with as well, not just as we’ve always done in the past, come forward with the voices of a few. And then made a decision. Rex Patrick has been fighting to have the aviation body, Casa, reduce the number of maintenance requirements on charity aircrafts, and adopt the NZ model. Over in the Senate, new LNP senator Susan McDonald is crossing the floor to support a motion from Rex Patrick This is either “waiting for a mate”, or “sorry, it’s saved”, depending on your generation. Question time as seen by Mike Bowers Scott Morrison, playing the role of today’s mood (as captured by Mike Bowers) And we are done. The folders are very stacked though. Hopefully this means we are coming to the end. Nope. Scott Morrison just raised a finger and said “one more” to Tony Smith. It’s on the Prime Minister’s Science Prize. So at least it’s a worthy dixer. We’re at the swap sides of the chamber stage of the latest farce Luke Howarth and Andrew Laming have both made beelines for the frontbench this time round. Christian Porter seems very confused about whether or not there is a motion before the House. Tony Smith seems very confused about why Christian Porter is confused. Tony Burke is now trying to explain to Christian Porter about how the motion process works. Tony Smith is now agreeing with Tony Burke while still trying to work out why Christian Porter is confused. And now we all have to sit here for another four minutes because that whole explanation of standing orders took so long, Smith has to extend the bells. “Bring back Christopher,” Anthony Albanese yells. Christian Porter has been confused into silence, so I guess there has been some silver lining. Labor is attempting to suspend standing orders, to debate the economy. It will fail. Obviously. Joel Fitzgibbon is taking the silences in between the divisions to troll Michael McCormack about his press conference being overshadowed by the prime minister’s radio interview, where he made the same announcement, but got in first. National MPs are still sending ‘can’t believe that happened’ messages. Good times all round. Stay with me folks. My computer program is struggling. I know the feeling. After a Senate estimates session dominated by two topics – the economy and raising Newstart – Labor’s Kristina Keneally has asked Mathias Cormann three ways why the prime minister has repeatedly refused to deny that he sought to have Brian Houston invited to the White House. Cormann is keeping the answers simple - he has nothing further to add to what Scott Morrison has said. Labor MPs are calling out “what are you hiding?” Seems they’ll need Senate Estimates next week, or maybe to bring out medieval instruments of torture like thumbscrews, to get to the bottom of this. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister: Yesterday in the Parliament the Prime Minister shut down a proposed debate on the economy and organised an additional question to himself so that only he could talk about the economy. Is that because the Prime Minister only wants to listen to himself? Will the Prime Minister agree to a debate on the economy today or doesn’t he have the confidence in his own economic management? Morrison: When the Labor Party can confirm what their actual policies are, maybe that’s when they want to start asking those questions. That’s the entire answer. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Former prime ministers John Howard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull all facilitated parliamentary debate at this time in the parliament on important economic issues facing the nation. Does the prime minister have the confidence in his economic position to be able to swallow his pride, follow their example and agree to a debate on the state of the economy today? Morrison: Every time, almost without exempt exemption, I come to this despatch Box, I’m talking about our economic policies. And the reason I do that – the reason I did that at the last election, Mr Speaker, the reason I do that is because I know that the strong economy is absolutely central to everything. It’s ensuring that you have the right economic policies that provide the bedrock to create the budget that can guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. That’s exactly what our government has been doing. In season and out, despite what the global challenges are, we have continued to be able to build the strength and capability of our budget position, but also of the Australian economy which has seen now almost 1.5 million Australians get a job. Now, Mr Speaker, that is the greatest argument when it comes to the economic policies of this government and that’s almost 1.5 million Australians who have got a job. That’s - that’s the great evidence, Mr Speaker, of 1.5 million almost lives of Australians that have been transformed because as a result of the policies of this government that has set the framework and economy for people to go and invest and take people on, Australians’ lives have been changed because the Liberal Party and Nationals believe that strong economic management, that disciplined and stable and certain financial policies are what actually at the end of the day guarantee our ability to reach record levels of hospital funding, record levels of education funding, and in the midst of what is a very severe drought, Mr Speaker, that we could again today confirm that those who would be coming off the farm household allowance will be given a $13,000 payment as a supplementary payment and just over $7,000 - $7,500, Mr Speaker, for individuals to continue to support them. And we’re able to do this within the constraints of the budget which has been brought back to surplus. As I remarked in this place some time ago, the Leader of the Opposition, he wants to have debates. I’m getting on with things. But how can the Leader of the Opposition have a debate when he can’t tell us what his tax policy is, what his climate change policy is or any other critical issues that he fails to answer questions on a daily basis. He hasn’t got a policy agenda, Mr Speaker. The reason we have to talk about their record in government and their policy agenda from the last election is they haven’t had any policies since that time. So it is absolutely fair for the Australian people, Mr Speaker, to hold them to their record of the policies they took to the last election and they were condemned for those policies by the Australian people at that time. We will continue, Mr Speaker, to deliver the policies that were confirmed at the last election - policies that over the last six years have created more almost 1.5 million jobs for Australians. To his credit, Dave Sharma manages to look a little embarrassed asking the next dixer, especially when he gets to the ‘alternative views’ part. “It’s terrible when bad questions happen to good members,” Ed Husic says. He is very much making hay from his backbench position. We are just about 3/4 through this and we have had 11 mentions of “panic” and eight uses of “crises” from government ministers in response to Labor questions. Deidre bloody Chambers! It’s almost like they ... have talking notes ... on ... a ... phrase they would like to catch on. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that yesterday the Treasurer falsely claimed that drought was the number 1 call on the budget, will the Prime Minister agree to have a debate on Australia’s economy and in particular the plight of farmers today based upon the facts? Morrison: Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition seems quite insistent on this point. But he obviously wasn’t insistent this morning because the matter of public importance which has been tabled today by the federal member for Barton does not mention the word “economy” at all, Mr Speaker. The word “economy”... is not even in it. So, Mr Speaker, if he can’t get his own side to agree about something, and that’s not uncommon at the moment, Mr Speaker, it’s not uncommon... I know that the Labor Party’s penchant is for panic and crisis, Mr Speaker, but honestly - he’s got to try to resolve the panic and crisis that is going on within his own party on so many issues. Whether it’s on - their response to climate, which they say is an emergency, but we’re not going to know their policy about it until the next election. And in between times, we’re going of the constant infighting between the member for Hunter and the member for South Australia... What is it again? Hindmarsh. The member for Hindmarsh, or member for Sydney or any other members. Or whether the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party is going to tear itself apart. Not only ridden by corruption but also seemed today by sexism as well, Mr Speaker. The leader of the Labor Party has got plenty on his plate and so I’ll leave him to deal with that all on his own measure Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that yesterday the Treasurer falsely claimed that drought was the number 1 call on the budget, will the Prime Minister agree to have a debate on Australia’s economy and in particular the plight of farmers today based upon the facts?

Not only ridden by corruption but also seemed today by sexism as well, Mr Speaker. The leader of the Labor Party has got plenty on his plate and so I’ll leave him to deal with that all on his own measure Angus Taylor actually just uttered the words “we are unified on energy and climate policy on this side of the House,” with a straight face, and honestly, I now understand how he got that Rhodes scholarship. It’s Peter Dutton HOW SAFE ARE YOU time! How safe are we today, Peter Dutton? Well, Australia, I’m really glad you asked. You are as safe as we can make you. BUT JUST IMAGINE IF LABOR WAS IN POWER. THE CHAOS. THE PANIC. THE KRAKENS! WHY, THE TRIFFIDS WOULD RISE UP. Thankfully Australia, you have Peter Dutton. So it’s all cool beans. Dutton finishes. Ed Husic: “Yeah, but you choose Greg [Hunt] as your deputy leader. It’s TRUE.” Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the prime minister. Given wage growth is the lowest it’s ever been, household debt is at record highs and consumer confidence is at a four-year low, why does the prime minister dismiss the role that this parliament has to play in debating the economic policy direction of the nation? Or doesn’t he have the confidence in his own position to be able to do so? Morrison: It’s all about you, isn’t it?! Through you, Mr Speaker! It’s about the Australian people, Mr Speaker. We debate these matters in the parliament everyday as the measures that we ... Apparently, Mr Speaker, when we bring legislation into this parliament that deals with economic measures, they’re apparently not debated in this place. The Leader of the Opposition has been here long enough to know that this debating chamber deals with copious pieces of legislation, Mr Speaker, and there is ample time. Now, before the election - next election, Mr Speaker, there will be the opportunity for the types of things that the Leader of the Opposition is speaking about and I have no doubt that will be the case as it is on every other occasion. But, Mr Speaker, it seems the debate he needs to have is within his own party because within his own party, they have got the climate fight club going on over there with umpteen different positions on climate change and, Mr Speaker, he’s got his own problems when it comes to the distractions of the New South Wales branch where I see compensation payments are measured in how many Aldi bags they’re handing out. [This bit was very, very loud.] Tony Smith pulls him up on relevance. Morrison: I’m in this place every single day talking about the economy. When we came to government, the real wage growth through the year was 0.5% and now today it’s 0.7%. I note the comments of the most recent RBA minutes and it says this, “Despite the level of high household debt in Australia, relative to other countries, the risks from household debt appear to have been mostly contained. Members noted that households continue to have large repayments on their housing debt and aggregate mortgage repayments equal to 2.5 years of repayment.” Mr Speaker, whether it comes to what we’re doing on jobs, whether it comes to what we’re doing in restoring the budget to surplus to ensure we’re there not only to meet the needs of today but we’re thinking ahead to meet the needs of tomorrow because we know how to keep our heads, to keep calm, Mr Speaker, and to ensure we continue to lay out the policies which we know are having the impact that they need to have and particularly in relation to employment. Employment in this country is the beginning of everything. Michael McCormack is summoned to the despatch box, and the longest three minutes of all our lifes begins anew. Empires have risen and fallen in this time. It’s amazing how he can make every minute feel like an hour. It’s Bob Katter time. He wants to know about a drought/dam plan. Are you aware that the PM after the north’s flooding cattle deaths came, listened and delivered two dams and $200m. At the drought summit in contrast, did you not say that the free market is not necessarily benevolent, we must learn to accept climate change, we cannot carry you forever. Ideology – where is the survival plan? Isn’t this the policy of the corporate elites when you buy up owner-operator Australia and the city suits enriched by selling to foreigners. Have you stopped a single sale? Minister, who is the master that you serve? He directs the question to David Littleproud, who tells him that was a question for the treasurer, but that the government is working to do what it can, but needs the states to come on board. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Can the Prime Minister confirm that since 2002 only two Australian Treasurers have presided over an unemployment rate that is higher than the OECD average? Will the Prime Minister agree to have a debate in this Parliament on Australia’s economy today? And will he admit the only two Treasurers who have had an unemployment rate that is higher than the OECD average are the current Treasurer and himself? Morrison: I’m interested in the jobs of Australians. Hear, hear. That’s what I’m interested in. The Leader of the Opposition is clearly only interested in his own job because all he wants to do is have a talk-fest in this place. I’m interested in the jobs of Australians. And taking action to ensure Australians are in work. Mr Speaker, more and more Australians in work and more Australians are in work today as a share of the Australian population than at any other time in Australia’s history. So, Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition may be thinking that this place, Mr Speaker, and the chatter that goes on here is terribly important to him and his position. I’m going to remain focused on those Australians, Mr Speaker, who simply want us to get on the job, on with the job, of ensuring we’re providing the stable and the calm and the responsible financial management which has brought the budget back to the surplus. Albanese stands up for a point of order, and Morrison goes to sit down, but not before saying what sounds like ‘another spurious point of order’ Albanese: There were two parts to the question. One part went to whether the current Treasurer and the current Prime Minister are the only two Australian Treasurers who... Yeah... He hasn’t mentioned that. The second is if he’s confident let’s have a debate about it. Tony Smith: No, I was just going to say to the Leader of the Opposition - whilst there’s additional tolerance extended to him because of his position and to the Prime Minister, points of order are not going to be used to ask another question or to make a political statement. There were two parts to the question. The Prime Minister can address one or the other or both. That’s the way it works. The Prime Minister has the call. Morrison: The Leader of the Opposition may want to come into this place and throw a tantrum at Question Time. Over whether or not someone’s going to agree to what he wants to do. He’s entitled... Mr Speaker, the tantrums of the Leader of the Opposition in this place only re-enforce their addiction to panic and crisis on the Labor Party. They love panic. They love crisis. And even when, Mr Speaker - even when circumstances don’t bear their argument out, they seek to create them, Mr Speaker, because they will look to any excuse to put their hands in the pockets of the Australian people and to rapidly increase spending to a reckless level. I referred earlier, Mr Speaker, to the catalogue of Labor Party failures in government when it came to policy. And the reason they engaged in those failures is they could never break their cycle of panic and crisis. They put in ill-considered measures, they didn’t think them through, they just smashed them through and in the Australian community and Australians have been paying for them ever since. At the last election I said, “You vote Labor once, you pay for it for the next decade”, and it seems exactly the same thing is true under this Leader of the Opposition. He can throw as many tantrums that he likes, we’ll just get on with the job of good government. There are quite a few high school students in the gallery today, who are looking very bemused at how they arrived at this place. Samesies. It’s another lickspittle to the prime minister on the economy. But rest assured - Michael McCormack will get his moment to pretend he still has ownership over drought policy as the Nationals leader. He’s just got to wait his turn. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Given that since May the Reserve Bank, the OECD, and the International Monetary Fund have all downgraded Australia’s growth forecast for this year, will the prime minister agree to have a debate in this chamber today on the economy? Morrison: I note – I understand from my colleagues that – they have listed for the MPI today [it] isn’t about the economy. So I’m a bit puzzled why they want one but they’re not prepared to table one, Mr Speaker. I tell you what – what our government is going to do, it’s not about debating the economy, it’s actually about implementing the policies that make our economy stronger and that’s what our government is doing. That’s what we’re doing, Mr Speaker. And we will continue to implement those sound and carefully-managed disciplined and stable and certain policies that as I have said today, Mr Speaker, has resulted in three years of consecutive increased in employment every single month, the longest run of jobs growth on a monthly basis this country has ever seen. So what we will do is not talk about it, we’ll get on to do it. I mean, government does job is a weird flex, but cool. You do you, Morrison government. We are now hearing the same answer again, but as a dixer. Dante obviously missed a circle. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the prime minister. Yesterday the prime minister refused to debate the economy in this House. Will he debate today whether the IMF was wrong to downgrade Australia’s economic growth forecast? Morrison: As I confirmed yesterday, the IMF ... midyear budget update and of course at budget time. So that is the normal process in terms of budget forecast and other forecasts that are presented here or elsewhere. And so that is a matter of public record, Mr Speaker. We have made no commentary regarding the accuracy of others’ forecasts because the government provides forecasts of its own as part of the midyear budget process. We’ll be doing that when it comes to the end of the year in the normal course of events, but given I have been asked about forecasts and economic data, Mr Speaker, I’m very pleased to report to the House today that employment has increased by 14,000 jobs in the month of September. And that was in line with the expectations – around 15,000 jobs, Mr Speaker, and I can say that we are rapidly approaching a 1.5m jobs since this government was first elected and I can also inform the House that this monthly increase in jobs in this last month, jobs have increased every month for the last three years under this government and that is the longest run, I’m advised, of consecutive monthly jobs growth ever, Mr Speaker. This government has reduced the level of unemployment from 5.7 to 5.2% and also decreased the level of youth unemployment by also a full percentage point, Mr Speaker, over that period of time. This government is doing the work through patient, through methodical, through stable, through disciplined economic policies whether it’s ensuring Australians can keep more of what they earn, or investing $100 billion in the infrastructure that the Australian economy needs to grow, investing and ensuring that we’re putting the right skills programs in place to enable people in this country to get the skills they need for the jobs that are there, Mr Speaker, and supporting business in the same way. Reducing the costs for business whether it’s in the industrial relations area, and I commend the minister for the work he’s doing, looking through all the things that are preventing people from getting jobs and costing unnecessarily the process of getting jobs and the work that the assistant minister is doing in stripping away regulations that is cost investment in this country. We’re expanding our trade horizons, lifting the percentage of trade agreements that cover our trade from 26% to 70 %. Our economic plan, the calm, measured, stable certain plan just gets on with the job of delivering for Australians and the increase of almost 15,000 jobs, Mr Speaker, 26,200 full-time jobs, bears that out. Given the Indigenous recognition push, this will be interesting. Scott Morrison has walked into the chamber with David Littleproud. See? EVERYTHING IS FINE Who’s that MP? It’s Ken O’Dowd. I’ll be heading to the chamber for question time – hit me up with your predictions (but I would say drought and the economy would be on the money). This is an interesting story from AAP: The Canberra bubble is truly full, with countries looking to set up shop in the capital being turned away because of a lack of available land. The National Capital Authority, which manages federal land in Canberra, told a parliamentary briefing they couldn’t offer much to those seeking land for diplomatic missions. “We’ve had a number of countries where we’ve basically said, ‘No, we can’t offer you anything’,” chief planner Andrew Smith said. He also told the committee negotiations with the Russian and Iranian missions to see them start works on their vacant land was ongoing. Smith said new embassies could be built for a number of reasons, including the beginning of a new diplomatic relationship with Australia or countries already stationed in Canberra looking to move out of rented premises. But some countries were also requesting larger premises for missions. “We are actually at a situation where we really can’t effectively offer anything much,” Smith said. He said there were a couple of vacant sites but the authority couldn’t offer them due to “reasons associated with terrain or soil conditions”. When contacted by AAP, the authority said it was up to the individual missions to confirm whether they had been turned back. The authority manages vacant sites but countries then have to look after it once they pick up the lease. It also has a “use it or lose it” policy where countries may have leased land taken away from them if they show no signs of developing it. Smith told the committee negotiations with the Russian and Iranian missions to see them start works on their own missions were continuing. Last year, the committee was told that Kuwait, Iran, Brunei, Russia and Bangladesh had stalled or inactive development on their land. At the time, Iran attributed delays to the unexpected death of their embassy’s new architect. It also said it was holding discussions with the ACT government on the shortage of diplomatic land. Just for a bit more context on that spat Sky’s Thomas O’Brien has been reporting on – the Nationals have been annoyed about how the drought policy has been handled for quite some time. There was agitation within the party when Malcolm Turnbull was prime minister, with members pushing Michael McCormack to do more. Then, when Scott Morrison took over the leadership, he also took over on the drought, which furthered angered a group of National MPs, who thought the Liberals should not be leading on a policy area which traditionally, has been theirs. So there has been angst, but a truce was called, given the drought was, from a PR point at least, a headline issue for the government. Then the announcement happened – and those tensions boiled over again. For the record, none of the National MPs are willing to go on the record to say this. But yes, they are *annoyed* Labor and the Greens are teaming up against an expansion of the fast-track visa process which among others would cover asylum seekers who arrived by plane. Contrary to some reports this morning, it is not a motion to scrap the controversial process altogether – although the Greens’ position is that it should be scrapped. What is the fast-track process? It’s complicated and has changed over the years but essentially: The fast-track assessment and removal process was introduced in 2014, and later expanded. It applies to the group of people who sought asylum in Australia by boat from August 2012 to January 2014 (and any of their children) commonly referred to as the “legacy caseload” and numbered more than 30,000. Under the process, asylum seekers can only apply for three-year temporary protection visas (TPV) or five-year Safe Haven Enterprise Visas (Shev), and are denied access to a full administrative review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. A refusal will automatically receive a limited review by the Immigration Assessment Authority (which was established for this purpose and sits within the AAT), but the IAA won’t hear new information. Some fast-track applicants are excluded from this. The process is controversial, with some legal and refugee experts criticising it as being more focused on speed than fairness. The Greens and Labor motion seeks to scrap an expansion of the process to cover people from the legacy cohort reapplying after their TPV or Shev expires, as well as anyone who arrived by air and who applies for temporary protection. It applies to any application made after 1 April this year. Immigration minister David Coleman told the Australian this would result in application assessment times blowing out from an average of 23 days to 504 days and would put more strain on the AAT. Labor disputes the figures, claiming that as of February last year the average time (from lodgement to a primary decision) was 415 days for TPVs and 316 for Shevs. “Labor does not support the government’s unfair fast track process because it is neither fast nor fair – if it was the third term Liberal government would have been able to process these applications by now,” said a spokesman for shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally. Greens senator Nick McKim said the fast track process was neither fast nor fair. “It should be scrapped altogether, not expanded,” he said. “It was set up with the clear aim of reducing people’s chances of claiming asylum and denying them avenues of appeal. This government continues to demonise people who have fled persecution.” A group of ex-judges, anti-corruption commissioners, and experts have laid out a blueprint for improving political and democratic integrity in the wake of this year’s election. The Centre for Public Integrity used a submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to argue there was “ample evidence” of the need for integrity reform, pointing to the $70m campaign spend by Clive Palmer and the post-political appointments of Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop. The centre, chaired by former NSW judge Anthony Whealy QC, wants parties and candidates to report all single donations of $1,000 or above or aggregated contributions of $3,000 over three years. The current threshold is $14,000. Donations should be disclosed to the public in real-time and include income from “party fundraisers, corporate sponsorship of business forums, and membership fees over $600 per year”. Electoral expenditure should be capped, and advertising limited by the finance or attorney-general’s department, which would purchase advertising space and distribute it to parties, candidates, and third parties. The centre also wants to see stronger post-separation employment bans apply to former ministers and parliamentary secretaries, preventing them from lobbying-related activities for five years in any area linked to their former portfolio. The ban would be enforced by an independent parliamentary integrity commissioner. “The Commonwealth has the weakest integrity laws in the country. Reform is crucial in the wake of the 2019 federal election,” Whealy said. The Centre for Public Integrity board includes ex-judges Tony Fitzgerald QC, David Ipp QC, Stephen Charles QC and Whealy, professors George Williams and Joo Cheong Tham, and barrister Geoffrey Watson SC. Mike Bowers has been very busy this morning. This would be the moment the Nationals gathered to announce the farm household allowance changes, but were overshadowed by the prime minister who was on not-Alan Jones radio doing exactly the same thing. Some colour in parliament, thanks to a Mongolian dance troupe. A very fed up Jacqui Lambie And that Senate light Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp have put together exactly what happened when Labor voted against the Greens motion to stop the government from scrapping the education infrastructure fund, in favour of redirecting it to emergency disaster responses: Labor has done a deal with the Morrison government to pass legislation redirecting education infrastructure money to disaster relief despite significant objections from the education spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek. The opposition made the decision to sign on to the emergency response fund in a special shadow cabinet meeting on Wednesday night, which also considered Labor’s stance on the free trade deal with Indonesia. But Guardian Australia understands Plibersek objected, and concerns persist within the caucus that the decision will blunt Labor’s ability to pursue the Coalition over cuts to education funding. Labor MPs, including the former research minister Kim Carr, have expressed concern that the redirection will deliver a significant blow to investment in research infrastructure. I have been flipping through some annual reports this morning. The Department of Employment provides us an update on the progress of its struggling $250m PaTH internships program. You might remember it’s the scheme where the government pays businesses like Hungry Jacks and Woolworths $1000 to host young welfare recipients. The interns get an incentive payment, which unions say equates to about $4 a day. The program was supposed to offer 30,000 internships a year – instead there have only been 6,464 since April 2017. The report does say that 65% of those internships led to a job. “Those who have completed Youth Jobs PaTH have achieved strong outcomes, but take-up continues to be a challenge,” the report says. The government poured another $10m into the scheme in August. Nick Martin (the doctor from the post a few down) approves this message Here’s the dairy industry inquiry motion Pauline Hanson put up and won (with the support of most of the Senate, excluding the government). That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by the third sitting day in March 2020: the performance of Australia’s dairy industry and the profitability of Australian dairy farmers since deregulation in 2000, with particular reference to – (a) the ability of Dairy Australia to act independently and support the best interests of both farmers and processors; (b) the accuracy of statistical data collected by Dairy Australia and the Australian Bureau of Statistics; (c) the funding of Dairy Australia and the extent of its consultation and engagement on the expenditure of levies revenue; (d) the merits of tasking the ACCC to investigate how it can regulate the price of milk per litre paid by processors to dairy farmers to ensure a viable dairy industry; (e) alternative approaches to supporting a viable dairy sector; (f) the introduction of a mandatory industry code of practice; and (g) any related matters. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has also unleashed on Labor for its decision not to back a motion to save the education fund (Jacqui Lambie was also very, very angry at the move). Labor and the Government have teamed up to stab education in the back by abolishing billions in education funding. I don’t expect any better of the regressive Liberals who have cut education funding at every turn, but Labor used to be the party of education. Now they are just selling out communities and young people to remain politically relevant. Labor are so eager to please the Liberals they voted to abolish the infrastructure fund they themselves established. The reality is unis, Tafes and research have all suffered under this Liberal-National government. Education in Australia is being dangerously underfunded. The official Labor press conference on the free trade agreement decision is out. From Madeleine King’s office: We will back these agreements, although we are concerned about how this Government will implement them. We have consulted widely on these issues with stakeholders in the union movement, industry, academia and the public service. I have written to Trade Minister Simon Birmingham seeking firm commitments to ensure that the implementation of the agreements safeguard Australian jobs and maximise market access for Australian businesses. We are seeking: A guarantee that these agreements protect Australian jobs. An assurance that working holiday makers are not exploited and are appropriately qualified for the work they undertake. The termination of the existing bilateral investment treaty with Indonesia. The termination or updating of out-dated bilateral investment treaties and investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses. A review of recent ISDS mechanisms in trade agreements. An inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT) into Australia’s treaty-making process. An assurance that there is no inference from the agreements that would require the privatisation of government services, nor restrict any future decision to bring acquire public assets. Labor’s call for the Government to pursue the termination of the existing Bilateral Investment Treaty between Australia and Indonesia was recently backed by JSCOT’s recent review of these trade agreements. This old treaty contains ISDS clauses with poor safeguards. Labor does not support the inclusion of ISDS provisions in trade agreements, but the report noted that the provisions in these new agreements include strong safeguards. Labor MPs on the JSCOT committee were instrumental in ensuring that these recommendations were included in the final report. Back in the Senate, One Nation put forward a motion to set up an inquiry into the “performance of Australia’s dairy industry and the profitability of farmers since deregulation in 2000”. Labor, the Greens and the crossbench all supported the inquiry. The government opposed it. Ayes - 33 Noes - 28 It is not often you see that section of the chamber supporting something One Nation puts up, but there you go. Just on Peter Dutton’s latest intervention on medevac, I have been reminded of this story from earlier in the year: A doctor on Nauru who blew the whistle on the deliberate medical neglect of refugees and asylum seekers on the island has been awarded a global award for free speech. Dr Nick Martin, the former senior medical officer for International Health and Medical Services on Nauru, spoke out publicly against what he described as Australia’s “inflexible, unswerving, and shameless” offshore immigration regime, that deliberately harmed asylum seekers and ignored doctors’ recommendations to treat dangerously ill people. In London on Wednesday night, he was awarded the 2019 Blueprint for Free Speech prize, an award previously won by Chelsea Manning, who revealed US military abuses and suspected war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, and John Kiriakou, the former CIA intelligence officer who revealed information about torture techniques including waterboarding. Martin is a veteran military doctor. The drug testing bill is on its way to the Senate. Labor is supporting the government’s call to abolish the $4bn education investment fund (the Coalition has wanted it gone since 2014 and, when it couldn’t get rid of it, just stopped spending the money from it, meaning it has sat there untouched), mostly because it doesn’t want to be seen as standing in front of emergency response fund (which is where the government wants to put this money). Jacqui Lambie has been calling for more Tafe funding for Tasmania since returning to the Senate. That’s why she is so angry. The money that is there, for that purpose, is now being officially taken away. Oh FFS. From AAP: Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has claimed Australian war veterans want refugee medical evacuation laws scrapped. Mr Dutton is locked in negotiations with Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, herself an army veteran, as he seeks to repeal the so-called medevac laws. “I believe very strongly that most Australians and certainly the vast majority of veterans would want us to abolish this law,” he told 2GB Radio on Thursday. There does not seem to be any evidence for this, other than Dutton is courting Lambie’s swing vote on this. We were expecting a press conference on the party’s position on free trade agreements after a lively caucus debate this morning, but it has now been called off. We are still waiting to get the details of what has been agreed upon, but expect something on scrapping old investor state dispute settlement clauses with Indonesia, independent economic analysis of the trade deals, and a concession on future labour market access. The unemployment figures are out That vote Paul Karp has been telling you about, on the $4bn education investment fund, is happening. Labor created it when it was in government. The Greens put in a motion to protect it. Labor is voting against the motion. Jacqui Lambie is ESPECIALLY pissed about it. Jacqui Lambie has just got stuck into the deal struck between the Coalition and Labor – describing it as “pretty pathetic” that Labor has agreed to abolish a $4bn education investment fund in return for $50m for Tafe. “I can get more out of the government with just one of me, than all of you put together,” Lambie said. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi says the $50m is “measly” and criticises Labor, which she said “used to be the party of public education”. Mathias Cormann has moved the bill out of the committee phase and is now setting a limit on the time for debate – so we’re going to have a final vote by 11.45. Is there anyone in this building not having a tantrum right now? If so, feel free to swing by the Guardian office for a chocolate. Because this whole place is one giant sulk right now, on all sides. Like I said, totally and absolutely, fine. Everything is fine. The Labor senator Murray Watt has revealed that the opposition has done a deal with the government to pass the emergency response fund bill, which abolishes the education investment fund and redirects it to “future emergency response and natural disaster recovery”. The bill is now being debated in the Senate – where the Greens attempted to stop its progress with amendments saving the education investment fund, and Jacqui Lambie has an amendment that limits the amount that can be taken to three-quarters of the education investment fund. Watt has moved opposition amendments that reflect the deal – to increase the quantum of the emergency response fund and lift the amount it can pay out each year from $150m to $200m, with the extra $50m to be spent on “disaster preparedness and mitigation infrastructure”. The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, thanked the opposition for their “constructive engagement” on the bill, indicating that the government will support the opposition amendments. Cormann explains that an extra $50m will be given “to establish a $100m Tafe revitalisation grants program in partnership with the states”, with 50/50 funding from the states. It seems the same $50m is being characterised as about disaster mitigation infrastructure and upgrading Tafes! But – in any event – a deal has been done so we expect the bill to pass this morning. It’s safe to say not all members of Labor’s movement are happy with the party’s decision to support the Indonesian free trade agreement. Joel Fitzgibbon also notes that while the FHA changes are being put into the parliament today, the Senate doesn’t sit again until November. He says the lump sum payments are not enough and the government’s response has not been enough. It is putting its budget surplus in front of the livelihoods of Australian farmers. Joel Fitzgibbon continues: Labor will use ... every mechanism available to it to try to prevent the government from taking people of the modest Farm Household Allowance and obviously they could be constitutional restrictions on what we can do in the parliament because it is effectively a money bill, proposition to spend more money, but I will make this point about that, while we may be barred from making amendments which have fiscal implications, restoring the payment for these families until this drought breaks, and we all pray outcomes in the not too distant future, is a modest amount of money, a very modest amount of money, in proportion to the total commonwealth budget. And if the prime minister wants to maintain this fiction, so loose with the truth is he, that he is spending $7bn on drought, then people everywhere will be asking well, why prime minister do you find it necessary to cut, cut these farming families’s of this modest payment. Joel Fitzgibbon: The time for in action and talking is behind us. It is time now to act in a meaningful way and I make the appeal to the prime minister again. Establish a bipartisan rural cabinet, drought cabinet, drought advisory committee – whatever he wants to call it – because the opposition understands the seriousness of the situation the country now faces. This really is approaching a wartime-like situation. And we stand ready to work with him to make the decisions that will be necessary to ensure another farming families can stay on the land, that rural communities can survive, and we can secure our food sources in this country without becoming too dependent on the importation of our food and fibre. Joel Fitzgibbon says the government’s response to the farm household allowance was “not good enough”, describing it as “modest” and “inadequate”. Dipping into state politics for a moment, because of the review Anthony Albanese has ordered into NSW Labor: Earlier today, Kaila Murnain tendered her resignation as General Secretary of the NSW Labor Party. The terms of the separation agreement are confidential, but consist of Ms Murnain’s basic legal entitlements. The full terms of the settlement will be reported to the next meeting of the Administrative Committee. The Party is actively considering seeking the recovery of all of its costs related to the Inquiry, including the sum payable to Ms Murnain, under its insurance policies and from its previous lawyers. A new branch secretary will not be elected until the review into the branch currently being conducted by Professor Michael Lavarch has provided its recommendations on the role of the General Secretary. Joel Fitzgibbon will hold a press conference at 10.45 today to give Labor’s response to the government’s latest drought announcement. Speaking of Ed Husic, you might remember that yesterday’s blog included a speech he made to the federation chamber about the rise of rightwing extremism – which is exactly what Asio warned about in its public annual report, released late yesterday. Ed Husic, talking to Sky, says there is “very little modelling” done on the trade agreements but Labor will “support them, because it is the right thing to do”. He says Labor wants to keep a close eye on “what they do to jobs” but that the agreements open up markets in way they haven’t been previously. Today’s announcement also might help explain why Josh Frydenberg yesterday called the drought the “biggest call on the budget”. Obviously, as the treasurer, he knew this was coming. From a money point of view, it’s still not – but it is certainly the reason he has had to rework quite a few figures lately. Bridget McKenzie gets to put the release out on it: Today the Australian Government introduced improvements to the Farm Household Allowance (FHA) that will help more farmers through periods of hardship. This is our next step in responding to the Independent Review of FHA which will see more than 30,000 farmers able to access this immediate support. Minister for Agriculture, Senator Bridget McKenzie said the changes extended farming families’ access the FHA from three years in their lifetime to four years out of every 10, recognising that farmers experience hardships, including droughts, more than once in their lives. “...A one-off drought relief payment of up to $13,000 for a farming family, and up to $7,500 for an individual is designed to help people determine whether they will be sustainable, should look at succession options or, in some instances choose to sell. “For the first time, we’ll link farm enterprises with their directly-related businesses and consider income and losses together – not just income – a big change in how Government support payments are provided to families. “Our Government had already made changes to make the FHA quicker and easier to access by reducing paperwork by a third and by temporarily increasing farm assets threshold to $5 million from 1 July 2019. “It is all part of the radical simplification of the FHA application process and key policy settings that the Prime Minister announced on 27 September.” These improvements include: a simplified assets test a significant redesign of the application process and form, including allowing farming couples to apply using the same form a strengthened case management approach to better support farmers in hardship through periods of financial difficulty. ...The FHA has been supporting Australian farmers since July 2014. It has paid more than $365 million to around 12,700 recipients in that time. David Littleproud, who had some interesting things to say about “metropolitan commentators” who were “frothing at the mouth” this morning *cough*, is now introducing those FHA changes in the chamber. Scott Morrison has announced changes to the farm household allowance – on the John Laws Sydney radio 2SM (who is not Alan Jones, you might note) show. At the end of the four years (the current time allowed for the payment, which essentially is welfare for farmers, and is paid at the same rate as Newstart) farmers will receive a lump sum payment of $7,500 for singles, and $13,000 for couples. Peter Dutton is speaking to the media and he says he feels there may be “some complacency” around security, because “thank God”, Australia has not been the scene of a major terrorist attack within its borders. He’s addressing Duncan Lewis’s parting call – to publicly request more money for Asio, noting that the resources were strained in the *public* report, as well as warning of a growing rightwing terrorism threat. Dutton blamed Labor for cutting Asio’s budget (Labor has not been in power since 2013) and said the government had been putting that money back. The prime minister is talking to John Laws on 2SM, but none of us can listen in, because the 2SM site is down. AAP on the NDIS announcement: The next boss of the agency responsible for the National Disability Insurance Scheme is a former senior NSW bureaucrat. Martin Hoffman, who has been both a commonwealth deputy secretary and secretary of the NSW Department of Finance, Services and Innovation, will take up the job from November 4. He has also held roles in the private sector, including as chief executive of Ninemsn. NDIS Minister Stuart Robert said Mr Hoffman has the “dedication, vision and expertise” to lead delivery of the transformational scheme. “He will build on the ground-breaking work already underway and will make a real difference in delivering on the government’s commitment to realising the full benefits of the scheme for participants,” the minister said. Labor had this week put pressure on the coalition to appoint a new leader for the National Disability Insurance Agency, with its previous chief executive Robert De Luca resigning in April. “It is literally leaderless,” opposition NDIS spokesman Bill Shorten told the lower house on Monday night. The organisation’s deputy chief executive Vicki Rundle had been acting in the top job since Mr De Luca’s resignation. Mr Hoffman has been appointed for a three-year term. Labor has voted to support the Indonesian free trade agreement, at the end of its shadow caucus meeting. Jim Chalmers was asked about Josh Frydenberg’s interview on his way into parliament his morning: The weakness in the Australian economy isn’t primarily because of weakness in the global economy, it’s primarily because the Morrison government doesn’t have a plan. Too many Australians are looking for work or for more work because the economy is floundering on the Liberals’ watch. Business knows, and the community knows, that we won’t get the economic growth we need to create good jobs while the government continues to sit on its hands. The call to parliament has sounded. Huzzah. Stuart Robert has called a doorstop to discuss this at 9.45. Asked for some of those specifics, Fiona Simson told the ABC it was about planning for the future, while looking at ways farmers could diversify their businesses: So, certainly, I think it’s about looking at how we farm now in Australia. How sustainable that is. It’s about looking at add to those income streams. It’s about supporting. We’re looking at, for example, at the moment we can create perhaps energy, we can create income streams from energy on underground gas … We know that there’s, you know, for example, solar energy can save farmers enormous amounts of money. It’s about looking at planning for drought on a regular basis. [It’s about] how can we make sure that farmers have access to, to to infrastructure on farms, and there’s a whole suite of measures that we want to discuss with the government, but it’s not just about farmers. It is also about rural regional communities. Because if we’re going to relieve the population pressures in the city, if we’re going to really truly build our regional communities at the moment – we’re talking about indoor agriculture, for example, with vertical farming … There’s many things we need to look at, Hamish, and that they need to be done together collaboratively, not in this sort of one government at a time, with the industry out of the room and communities out of the room. We need to plan for it. Fiona Simson, the president of the National Farmers’ Federation, also had a chat to ABC radio this morning. Here is some of what she had to say about the drought policy: [Policies] are being developed in a vacuum because there’s no real effective way of measuring whether or not these these measures have been robust. When we get to the end of a drought, and we’ve done it before, we’ve done it recently in the millennial drought, then we just sort of seemed to go that one’s over, pick up our pieces and and wait for the next rather than thinking every day – how can we make a rural and regional communities more resilient? How can we make our farmers, our really important food- and fibre-growing people, more resilient? How can we keep jobs in the in the country areas? How can we make sure that people have access to fresh water, which is just a first world sort of thing? And these are things that our strategy, which involves all levels of government, working together hand in hand on a regular basis with the community, with farmers, to actually get, you know, put in a new way, a new paradigm of dealing with drought in Australia … I’ll just finish the that no other government has been able to do this yet. It is an incredibly difficult space to work in. And look, we are really grateful for the Morrison government’s commitment to look at this and to work with us in developing this new strategy. And this new way of treating drought in Australia. There has also been a bit of chatter this morning about Josh Frydenberg’s interview with Phil Coorey in the Fin, in the lead-up to his attendance at the IMF meeting in Washington. It’s an extension of what he was saying yesterday, in response to calls for stimulus after the IMF’s downgrade of Australia’s economic growth outlook. The promised surplus is now being billed as an “economic buffer”. “A strong budget position helps build the resilience of the economy for external shocks, whenever that may occur, and your ability to respond to those shocks with a fiscal response,” Frydenberg told the Australian Financial Review. I am not sure that is going to calm the calls for stimulus, given the economy’s position, but you can start to see the narrative they are building – stimulus is coming, but it will be after the surplus, and what the government considers “good” stimulus (“bad” stimulus, in this scenario being painted, was Labor’s response after the GFC). The attorney general, Christian Porter, will introduce amendments to native title today. From his release: The native title legislation amendment bill 2019 implements a range of measures recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) and the Council of Australian Governments (Coag). It was also informed by extensive consultation with native title claimants who said they wanted more flexibility and efficiency built into the system. The bill will provide claimant groups with:  Improved pathways for dispute resolution following a determination of native title;  Increased transparency and accountability for prescribed bodies corporate (the corporations set up to manage native title);  Greater flexibility for bodies corporate to set their own internal processes. Importantly, the bill also seeks to end the uncertainty created by a 2017 full federal court judgment that cast doubts over the validity of hundreds of what are known as “section 31” agreements, which are negotiated between claimant groups and industry to facilitate land access. The McGlade decision found that such agreements were only valid if they were signed by all representatives of a claimant group, rather than by a majority – even if the only reason for not obtaining every signature was because a single representative had died. The bill will validate all affected agreements and ensure that a majority of representatives can negotiate on behalf of a claimant group in the future. For some history on this issue, you can head here. I told you drought was going to be the issue of the day. I’m listening to Hamish Macdonald interview David Littleproud on RN, and it sounded as though Littleproud just took a swipe at some city media types, saying that “while I get a lot of metropolitan commentators are frothing at the mouth at the moment” in regards to the drought and what needs to be done, says we “need to be careful” not to scare the next generation from entering agriculture as a career. Macdonald pulled him up on the “metropolitan commentators ... frothing at the mouth” comment. HM: To be perfectly fair, having spent a fair amount of time in drought-affected regions recently, I mean, that is what you hear when you go there – I mean, I don’t think it is just metropolitan commentators saying this sort of stuff [that more needs to be done], people on farms are quite desperate at the moment; are you sort of diminishing their plight by suggesting that? DL: Totally not, Hamish. I don’t have the comfort of tucking myself into a bed in a metropolitan [area], I actually live and breath it every day, my friend. I actually see these people and I know them by face and by name. These are resilient people. And they believe in what they do and they know what they are doing is the best in the world. Now we are going through a tough time and we’ve continued to have these conditions over our whole agricultural history, but we’ve faced up to them, and we’ve continued to work through them. So we will get through this, and when people say they want hope, then it is about leadership of hope and saying we will get through this, your government will stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this, and we will get you through, in the here and now ... the community and the future, that is why we are going to prepare to get them through this one and prepare them to get through the next one. While it is not unusual for National MPs to talk down about metro journalists with the “latte sippers” line alive and well in Michael McCormack’s world, Littleproud’s comment is interesting given its timing. The conservative Sydney 2GB radio host Alan Jones had quite the combative interview with Scott Morrison on Monday on the issue of the drought, loudly interrupting with “how is that going to feed cows?” as Morrison detailed his government’s spending, and then, when talking about the drought on his Sky News show the next night, broke down crying. I’m not sure if that counts as “frothing at the mouth” but I’m also pretty sure there will be some raised eyebrows when the comment gets back to some of those metropolitan offices. Meanwhile, Paul Karp had this story late yesterday, after taking a look through the Asio annual report: The threat from extreme rightwing terrorism in Australia has increased in recent years and will remain an “enduring threat”, according to Australia’s spy agency. The Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation issued the warning in its latest annual report, adding that “extreme rightwing groups in Australia are more cohesive and organised than they have been in previous years”. The comments amp up the agency’s concern about rightwing extremist terrorism, after Asio boss Duncan Lewis told Senate estimates in April it was an important issue but the Christchurch massacre had not changed the agency’s calculus. Asio has also reported a strain on its resources, with more calls for advice. Kristina Keneally told the ABC the security agency had sounded an “alarm bell”. “It’s an incredibly important agency in our national security framework and for them to be reporting in this time when the challenges they face are quite complex, that they are stretched for resources, well that’s an alarm bell,” she said. Labor MPs have been called to a special meeting of caucus at 8.30am this morning to decide their position on three new free trade agreements. The meeting comes after a working group of shadow ministers and union leaders held meetings on Wednesday afternoon to try to work through concerns over the Indonesian FTA. Labor is expected to endorse the enabling legislation but a number of MPs from both the left and right factions will push for the party to demand concessions on labor market access and skills testing. It’s expected to spark a heated debate in caucus, particularly given that elements of the agreements are at odds with the party’s national platform. The ACTU has been spearheading lobbying efforts to get the deals knocked off, raising fears about future market access for temporary visa holders under the Indonesian deal. The shadow trade minister, Madeleine King, has been clear that she wants the party to support the agreements but may be forced to adopt a new negotiating position to appease the concerns of caucus. We will know more later this morning. Welcome to the last sitting day for this week. After the parliament rises today, senators will turn their attention to Senate estimates next week, while the House will sit alone. But the ongoing drought looms large over everything being done in this building at the moment, with the government repeatedly forced to defend their strategy. Yesterday, on Sky, Labor’s Joel Fitzgibbon called for a drought “war cabinet”. The government says it is working with everyone it can to deliver its policy. The National Farmers’ Federation released its own drought plan late yesterday, after repeated calls to plan for the future. From Sarah Martin: Under the policy, the NFF framework proposes that industry, community groups and the three tiers of government all work together in developing a drought strategy. This would identify specific drought measures that need to be maintained, amended or reviewed; and to propose new drought measures, build on the Coag national drought agreement and incorporate lessons learned from past droughts, create a drought forum and establish a drought committee. “While this national drought policy comes too late to help those managing this drought, the NFF is determined to see that we don’t find ourselves, once again, without a plan for drought,” the NFF’s Fiona Simson said. “We continue to consult with the government about further measures to assist farmers during this drought, including recommendations for commonwealth support for local government rate relief.” David Littleproud, speaking to the ABC this morning, says the government “already has” a drought strategy. “Our response has been one of being responsive to the situation,” he said. This is not an issue that is going anywhere. And it is only going to get bigger, with no rains in sight. We’ll bring you that, as well everything else that happens today. Mike Bowers is, as always, up and about, cameras in hand, while Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp will also be burrowing away on stories. You’ll catch me on the socials, and, when I get a chance, in the comments. And of course, the coffee line. Ready? Let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/ng-interactive/2017/jun/02/presidents-paris-climate-speech-annotated-trumps-claims-analysed","type":"interactive","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-02T01:42:40Z","webTitle":"Fact check: Trump's Paris climate speech claims analyzed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2017/jun/02/presidents-paris-climate-speech-annotated-trumps-claims-analysed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/ng-interactive/2017/jun/02/presidents-paris-climate-speech-annotated-trumps-claims-analysed","fields":{"headline":"Fact check: Trump's Paris climate speech claims analyzed","bodyText":"So we’re getting out. But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine. So that’s that. After months of fevered speculation and lobbying, Trump sticks to his campaign pledge to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord. He does so with a caveat that’s delivered rather casually – the US will renegotiate this pact, or maybe some other pact, aimed at ensuring the future liveability of the planet. But if it doesn’t work out, that’s OK. Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7m lost jobs by 2025, according to the National Economic Research Associates. Trump’s vision of a hobbled America, ransacked by pointless environmental regulation, draws upon a highly disputed study published in March. National Economic Research Associates has done work for front groups for coal companies in the past and this study was at the behest of the American Council for Capital Formation, which counts Exxon Mobil, the American Petroleum Institute and Charles Koch as major donors. The Paris agreement itself places no “energy restrictions” on the US – it’s a voluntary agreement that leaves it up to countries to decide how to cut their emissions. But several economists have warned that leaving the Paris agreement will stymie clean energy investment and ensure the production of solar panels and wind turbines – the very blue-collar jobs Trump claims to value – will take place in China rather than the US. It could get worse still – some countries are mulling a carbon “tariff” on US goods over Trump’s decision to swim against the energy transition that is underway. None of this will help a coal industry that was in decline long before the Paris deal. This is perhaps why business support for Paris is broad, uniting the likes of Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Apple and even BP. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years – 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States. Trump repeatedly touches on a familiar theme of the US being taken advantage of by foreign ingrates. The Paris deal was considered a breakthrough because it required all nations to curb their emissions – including, crucially, China and India. Given that both these countries do not have more than a century of mass industrialization behind them, unlike the US, their commitments should be seen in context. Indeed, recent analysis has shown that China may have already peaked its coal use and will be reducing its emissions sooner than expected, although suspicions linger over its accounting methods. Either way, both China and India have reiterated their commitment to the Paris deal in recent weeks and are investing heavily in renewable energy. That they are doing this with tens of millions of their people still without electricity and other basic services shows that perhaps it isn’t terribly unfair to expect the world’s wealthiest nation to do likewise. In short, the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. According to the Department of Energy, there are about 373,000 Americans working in solar energy – more than double that of the coal industry. The coal sector has been shedding jobs for decades, driven by automation of work and, more recently, the abundance of cheap natural gas. Major coal mining firms have conceded those jobs aren’t coming back and it’s not quite clear how American mining jobs can be shifted overseas given the US isn’t a coal exporter and US power plants aren’t crying out for extra minerals to keep the lights on. What’s more likely, according to economists, is that growth in renewable energy innovation and construction jobs will tip overseas, probably to China, which has committed to investing $360bn in the sector in the coming years. Our country will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life. This dark vision would perhaps approach reality if a.) the only source of electricity in the US was coal, rather than a mix of nuclear, gas, coal and renewables, b.) the Paris agreement set any sort of binding limit on energy sources, and c.) the US government followed through with this by shutting down power plants rather than asking states to submit plans to transition away from polluting fossil fuels (as the Obama administration did). None of that has actually happened or was slated to happen. Even if the Paris agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree – think of that; this much – Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount. White House “talking points” distributed before Trump’s speech cite MIT research for the 0.2-degree reduction. This prompted a swift rebuttal from the actual source, a collaboration between MIT and Climate Interactive. The researchers point out the reduction in expected warming from emissions cuts promised at Paris will be 0.9 degrees by 2100, not 0.2 degrees. This still won’t be enough to avoid breaching the warming limit set out in the Paris deal but it’s worth considering that 0.9C is roughly the global temperature rise experienced since the industrial revolution. People living in southern Florida, or Bangladesh or beside a coral reef that provides food and a livelihood would have radically different lives if the global temperature increase was double its current level. The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We’ll be the cleanest. We’re going to have the cleanest air. We’re going to have the cleanest water. Under the Trump administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has paused or scrapped rules that prevent the dumping of mining waste into streams, curb emissions from vehicles and power plants and stop mercury and arsenic seeping into waterways. The EPA’s proposed budget also cuts measures that prevent lead in drinking water and also scraps clean-ups of the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico and shrinks the funding of enforcement of pollution rules. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris accord or something that we can do that’s much better than the Paris accord. And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled. But until we do that, we’re out of the agreement. In common with some other policy areas, Trump seems to be believe his negotiating skills can overcome issues that leaders have grappled with for years. Paris came about after 20 years of often painful incremental manoeuvrings that included the disappointment of Copenhagen in 2009, and world leaders have already made clear they aren’t “thrilled” at the prospect of reversing this breakthrough. France, Italy and Germany released a statement saying that the Paris deal can’t be redone, while the EU and China jointly declared the agreement was “irreversible”. The UK, Canada and Australia all reaffirmed their commitment to the agreement with Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, saying he is “deeply disappointed” with Trump’s decision. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres called it a “major disappointment.” The US may return to Paris, with Trump or a future president, but there will be lingering diplomatic damage that will haunt the country on the international stage far more than the Kyoto reversal under George W Bush. At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? Well, at this point there’s certainly not much laughter. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. Here, Trump seems to confuse the venue of the UN climate agreement signing for the actual subject of the accord. It’s also worth noting that Bill Peduto, mayor of Pittsburgh, committed the city to the Paris deal, along with dozens of other US municipalities, after Trump’s announcement. About 65,000 people in Pennsylvania work in the renewable energy industry, more than mining, oil and gas combined. Of course, the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the green fund, which we terminated. Again Trump portrays the Paris deal as an onerous ball and chain around the ankle of a struggling America, which somehow isn’t now one of the world’s leading polluters. The climate fund is voluntary and Barack Obama pledged about $3bn to it. Given the scale of the climate challenge – rising seas, drought and disasters are already estimated to displace about 20 million people a year, according to the UN – even this funding is likely to be insufficient. And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. One of the – ultimately successful – arguments put by opponents of the Paris deal to Trump was that his domestic agenda of revoking Obama-era environmental regulations would be jeopardised by the agreement. Architects of the deal have disputed this, pointing out that it is voluntary and non-binding and would carry no weight in a US court. Ultimately, the only recourse to Trump’s decision will be through the ballot box. The notice period for withdrawing from the Paris deal expires in November 2020 – the month of the next presidential election. Climate change will likely be, for once, a live issue at the election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/jan/18/neither-trump-nor-turnbull-can-turn-back-the-tide-on-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-17T22:43:54Z","webTitle":"Neither Trump nor Turnbull can turn back the tide on renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/18/neither-trump-nor-turnbull-can-turn-back-the-tide-on-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/18/neither-trump-nor-turnbull-can-turn-back-the-tide-on-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Neither Trump nor Turnbull can turn back the tide on renewables","bodyText":"The inauguration of President Trump this Saturday (Australian time) marks a radical change in the world as we know it. It ushers in the beginning of four years where progressive issues as far reaching as race equality, women’s health, nuclear and foreign policy, and of course climate change will be under sustained attack. Less than a year after the world agreed a historic climate pact in Paris, the US – the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas polluter – elected a man who wants to revive the glory days of coal, oil and gas. To less fanfare here at home, the Turnbull government is pursuing a similar trajectory. Ploughing through the headwinds is our resources minister, Matt Canavan, who is seeking a $100bn investment in coal and is the biggest campaigner for a new mega-coalmine in Queensland’s Galilee basin run by the Indian company Adani. The truth is that try as they might, neither Trump nor the Australian government can turn the tide on renewable energy, nor resuscitate an ailing coal industry with a clear expiration date. This is not a moral or political case, but a purely economical one. This is why I remain quietly optimistic about the continued global transition away from fossil fuels despite the hostile political climate. Renewable energy is rapidly becoming the cheapest and easiest way of producing energy in countries around the world. Investors everywhere are watching these changes and the market is responding rapidly. China has recently announced that it will invest US$361bn into renewable energy over the next four years, creating 13m jobs in the process. This is as much as the entire globe spent on renewables over the past four years. This makes good financial sense as well, since the cost of building large-scale solar has decreased by about 40% since 2010, making it cheaper than coal. Meanwhile, fossil fuels have become a leading cause of death globally, just behind tobacco. Indeed, air pollution from coal caused 770,000 premature deaths last year in China and India alone. Tell that to Matt Canavan next time he waxes poetic about the virtues of coal in developing economies. Together these factors add up to what a University of Queensland economist, John Quiggin, says is a continuing trend away from coal that will only pick up speed. “Until relatively recently, coal-fired electricity generation has been commercially successful,” he says. “That’s changing fast around the world due to the combination of carbon prices, competition from renewables and restrictions on particulate emissions. Taken together, these factors make it uneconomic to build a new coal-fired power station anywhere in the world.” Bypassing government, many investors and businesses in Australia and around the world are now asking just how quickly this transition will happen. Over the past few decades it has been almost commonplace for new technologies in a range of sectors to erode the competitive advantages of incumbents incredibly quickly. A great example that could provide an interesting case study for the potential of renewable energy is LED lighting. In 2010 LED lights had only 1% of the US market. With clever government incentives and regulation encouraging the transition, almost overnight the market shifted. Within five years, LED lights had moved into almost 60% of the market, making it one of the fastest technology shifts in human history. The trajectory was remarkably similar to what we are seeing with renewable energy now. While the Turnbull government’s bungling of federal energy policy is stifling some of the potential for clean energy developments, many Australian business leaders are steaming ahead regardless. Australia is the best country on the planet for solar energy and the former BHP executive Phil Galloway is looking to capitalise on that. He has plans to roll out 220,000 solar panels across the empty space on an almond farm in regional Victoria, generating enough electricity to power about 30,000 homes. Inspired by the model adopted in the US by companies such as Google and Apple, Galloway would look to negotiate power-supply agreements directly with large local companies rather than energy retailers. This is just the sort of project that is not only becoming more viable but, with a bit of clever government incentivisation, could transform Australia’s energy future and create a clean energy transformation that would create countless new, sustainable jobs across the country. A similar project is under way in the sleepy Victorian town of Yackandandah. Residents there have come together under the banner of 100% renewable energy and energy sovereignty to pursue a transformation of their own. Working with AusNet, which runs the Victorian grid, the town will trial new storage technology along with setting up a renewable energy farm to power it, with profits from the energy generated being ploughed back into their community. This is one of dozens of community renewable energy projects that are quietly driving Australia away from polluting energy. Likewise, in the northern rivers region of New South Wales, a community-owned energy company is seeking to offer a clean alternative to the dirty energy produced by Australia’s big three energy retailers: AGL, Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia. Enova Energy is making inroads not only to kickstart renewable energy but also to empower energy consumers. Headed by former executive heavyweights disillusioned by the government’s inaction on renewables, including Alison Crook, a former Monash University deputy chancellor and Qantas businesswoman of the year, Enova’s mission is to offer the country’s highest feed-in tariffs and lowest GreenPower price while working with social welfare groups to tackle energy poverty in the region. Our governments may now be held hostage by visionless representatives more determined on prosecuting their narrow ideological agenda than helping Australia find solutions to its most pressing issues but, elsewhere, leaders in other fields are transforming the way we generate, share and manage our energy needs and addressing climate change. Bellicose political rhetoric can’t hide the economic fact: renewable energy is the future. My advice for Donald Trump and Malcolm Turnbull is this: find an economic reason to justify being part of the clean energy revolution to the deniers around you or watch as investors, businesses and communities steamroll right over you."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2015/aug/09/australians-fear-coalition-is-not-taking-climate-change-seriously-poll-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-09T14:01:03Z","webTitle":"Australians fear Coalition is not taking climate change seriously, poll shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/09/australians-fear-coalition-is-not-taking-climate-change-seriously-poll-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/aug/09/australians-fear-coalition-is-not-taking-climate-change-seriously-poll-shows","fields":{"headline":"Australians fear Coalition is not taking climate change seriously, poll shows","bodyText":"Australians are deeply worried the Abbott government is underestimating the importance of climate change, new polling shows, as cabinet debates crucial long-term targets for greenhouse gas reductions. The annual polling by the Climate Institute thinktank reveals Australians overwhelmingly support wind and solar energy – as the Coalition seeks to limit support for both – and see it as inevitable that coal-fired power stations will have to be phased out and replaced. But at the same time, almost half those surveyed (47%) think Labor’s carbon policies will “just increase electricity prices and not do much about pollution”. Labor has not announced a costed or detailed policy but has said it will reintroduce an emissions trading scheme and aim for 50% renewable energy by 2030. Federal cabinet will on Monday decide on the post-2020 emissions reduction target Australia will take to the UN Paris talks in December and the decision will then be presented to the Coalition party room. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, who leads the climate negotiations, and the environment minister, Greg Hunt, have been arguing that Australia needs to adopt an emission reduction target broadly in line with those already tabled by the US and Canada – a reduction of between 25% and 28% of 2005 levels by 2030 – but others in cabinet have expressed concern that the government won’t get any political credit from taking on an ambitious goal. And once the government commits to a target it will be under pressure to explain the policy it intends to use to meet it, with business groups, thinktanks and market analysts all arguing the Direct Action policy would need substantial modification before it was up to the task. Business groups have been lobbying fiercely for the government to drop its opposition to the purchase of carbon credits from overseas. Labor has not promised bipartisan support to a “lowball” target but has also not yet outlined a costed policy to reach a long-term climate goal. Findings from the Climate Institute research include: Australians are concerned that the seriousness of climate change is underestimated by the government (59% agree, 32% strongly agreeing, 16% disagree). 63% think the Abbott government should take climate change more seriously, up six points from 2014. 71% of Australians agree “it is inevitable that Australia’s current coal-fired generation will need to be replaced” (13% neutral, 5% disagree, 11% don’t know). 72% agree governments need to implement a plan to ensure the orderly closure of old coal plants and their replacement with clean energy (7% disagree and 14% neutral). 65% agree that “reducing the investment in windfarms and householder solar power is the opposite of what is needed” (39% strongly agree,11% disagree). Solar is the most preferred energy source: when presented with eight sources, 84% of respondents place solar energy within their top three preferred options. This is up 2 points from 2014. Wind energy is the second most preferred option, with 69% supporting it in their preferred energy mix. Coal and nuclear are least preferred with only a 13% backing each as a top three choice. The polling, and the decision on Australia’s post-2020 emissions reduction target, come after the Abbott government wound back the renewable energy target, instructed the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (which it had unsuccessfully tried to shut) to stop investing in solar and wind, and announced it would appoint a “wind commissioner” to handle complaints about noise from wind turbines and new scientific committee to investigate, again, their alleged impacts on human health. “This week’s decision on Australia’s initial post-2020 climate commitment comes as nearly two-thirds of Australian believe that the Abbott government should take climate change more seriously, a surge of 6% from last year,” said John Connor, the chief executive of the Climate Institute. “Our research also shows the carbon tax spectre still has some sting but perhaps less than would be expected. A third (36%) agree they won’t vote for the ALP because they will bring back the carbon tax, with a quarter (24%) neutral and 28% disagreeing. “The government and the opposition have an opportunity to join mainstream Australian attitudes with climate commitments and policies which can limit carbon pollution, encourage renewable energy and clean up our energy system.” The US has said it will reduce greenhouse emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels in 2025 and aim for an 80% reduction by 2050. Canada says it will reduce its emissions by 30% on 2005 levels by 2030. The EU says it will reduce emissions by 40% by 2030 relative to 1990 levels. The poll was a nationally representative online survey conducted by Galaxy Research 27-29 July 2015 among 1,016 Australians aged over 18. Its margin of error is +/- 3%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/aug/31/biogas-projects-suspended-amid-uncertainty-about-renewable-energy-grants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-31T05:08:47Z","webTitle":"Uncertainty about Arena halts renewable energy projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/biogas-projects-suspended-amid-uncertainty-about-renewable-energy-grants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/aug/31/biogas-projects-suspended-amid-uncertainty-about-renewable-energy-grants","fields":{"headline":"Uncertainty about Arena halts renewable energy projects","bodyText":"Renewable energy projects in Australia are already being suspended as a result of the two major parties’ plans to effectively abolish the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena). In an announcement this week to the Australian Stock Exchange, Geodynamics announced it was suspending two large biogas projects in Goulburn, New South Wales, and Mindarra, Western Australia. It told investors it was doing so because of uncertainty surrounding the possibility of getting grant funding for the projects in the future. “In light of recent announcements regarding policy changes to key federal government grant programs, the availability of grant funding is increasingly uncertain,” it said. “Without grant funding these two projects will not meet the targeted investment returns. As a result, following consultation with our customers, work on these projects has been suspended until there is certainty on grant funding availability.” Guardian Australia understands that if the cuts to Arena go through, Geodynamics will cancel the projects. The company said it calculated that the suspension of the two projects would impose a $4.69m hit to its value. The Coalition announced before the election it would save $1.3bn by removing the ability of Arena to make grants – essentially abolishing the organisation. Labor didn’t oppose the cuts, and included them in the savings it took to the election. The cuts now form part of the “omnibus” bill the government will introduce to parliament, which it says contains all the budget savings agreed to before the election by both parties. But Labor has indicated it might oppose the measure, since it doesn’t include an extra $300m for renewable energy projects that Labor took to the election. The project at Goulburn was planned to generate up to one megawatt of renewable energy from manure and other organic waste produced by a nearby sheep processing facility. It would have converted that waste into methane, which would then be burned in a power station built on the site to create electricity. The company said the project would have been the first biogas plant that generated electricity that offset grid-supplied electricity. The Mindarra project was similar, set to be built at a piggery, and would produce more power than was needed by the piggery, exporting the excess to the grid. Tom Quinn, executive director of the Future Business Council, said the issue affecting Geodynamics was likely to be already impacting a lot of other businesses trying to pursue renewable energy. “It’s surprising how early it is, but it’s also inevitable,” he said. “If they do go ahead with the Arena cuts, this is just the beginning. We’re going to see the best and the brightest of Australia’s renewables business going overseas unless we can keep Arena and have strong bipartisan support for it. “It’s very easy to talk about innovation but this is what innovation looks like in practice.” On Wednesday 190 members of Australia’s solar research community signed an open letter calling on both political parties to not proceed with the cut to Arena. “If Arena is debilitated then hundreds of people would lose their jobs within a year or two,” the researchers wrote. “In the longer term, Australia’s leadership in solar energy would vanish. This would be completely at odds with the government’s innovation agenda and its commitment at the Paris climate conference to double clean energy R&amp;D by 2020 under the international Mission Innovation program, and with the ALP’s climate change action plan launched in 2015 at UNSW Australia, and reinforced by opposition leader Bill Shorten at ANU also in 2015.” Geodynamics declined to comment on the announcement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/27/what-is-the-future-of-foreign-aid","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-27T13:31:38Z","webTitle":"What is the future of foreign aid?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/27/what-is-the-future-of-foreign-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/27/what-is-the-future-of-foreign-aid","fields":{"headline":"What is the future of foreign aid?","bodyText":"Should foreign aid continue? It’s a complex question. There are so many types of aid, and different countries have different models. The Chinese, for example, are committed to vast infrastructural programmes, particularly to do with transport and communications. Other countries take other approaches. No one is suggesting humanitarian aid should end. Catastrophe evokes a human response to help fellow creatures. When help is not possible, for example in ending the carnage in Aleppo, we feel frustration and despair that people suffer without respite. But the debate over the extent of aid and whether it should continue is concerned with wastage, corruption and dependency. It recognises that while much of western aid cultivates markets for exports, the overall effect appears to be enrichment of an elite. Poverty has been greatly reduced over the last decade, but the discrepancy between rich and poor seems to be growing. And, in many countries, the rich seem still to be committed to accumulation rather than to the circulation of capital and its investment in new enterprises that would generate employment. Where a proportion of aid leaks, it facilitates an elite that is not economically dynamic, merely rich. Critics, such as the global economist Dambisa Moyo, have long accused aid regimes of retarding rather than developing. Her critique is that aid creates dependency, and the sub-text is that this is precisely because western donors prefer it that way. An Africa, for instance, that develops through the vibrancy of its trade – in particular its manufactured products – would threaten western industries and the voter base of governments from both left and right. Aid is expressed in terms of a pious commitment, but is in fact a long-term selfishness. This is a powerful critique, but not every developing country has something to trade. Some are merely impoverished. Others are the site of intense competition for resource extraction: west and east seek Africa’s mineral resources for future industrial capacity. Africa sells those resources because it has been discouraged from developing industrialisation of its own. This discouragement has perverse and arcadian aspects – forms of romanticism. If Africa industrialised, it would add to world pollution. But this ignores the possibility of a generation jump in technologies. Africa as a leader in vast solar energy plants, for instance, requires a leap in imagination, and often involves skills not plentiful even in the west. The debate on aid comes down to this kind of lack of imagination. We have cemented in our minds the idea of a hierarchy in the world’s nations: the developing world is below us and we need to help them, preferably to our advantage. But we do not want them to rise above us. How many new Chinas can the west bear? Aid to this extent becomes a solidification of the current status quo. But if the mantra of “trade not aid” took off, the left would complain as industrial workers lost their jobs because of cheap imports from new manufacturers, while left and right would complain as new economic centres of power reduced our international capacity to influence others. It is we who would then become dependent. This is a debate worth conducting. No transformation will occur overnight. Certainly, Britain’s aid contribution seems set to diminish as it leaves the EU – and the multilateral funding schemes that have delivered quantities of aid to the outside world. But humanitarian aid should certainly not diminish. Here, the public can sometimes lead the governments of the west. I remember in 1991 walking by the Red Sea in front of the bombed-out ruins of the entire city of Massawa in Eritrea. As part of Ethiopia, the region had suffered greatly from the terrible famine of 1984. A young boy came to walk with me. In broken English he asked where I came from. When I replied, he said: “My father tells me that when I was born, we had terrible famine. He said a singer from your land tried to help us.” Bob Geldof’s name had disappeared, but a memory of him remained. If aid is often fearful of the future, and selfish, it is not always so.

On the other side of the Atlantic, a more modest, quieter challenger plans to take on the US electric car giant. Based within a railway arch, with the sound of trains running overhead from nearby London Bridge station and surrounded by other ecologically minded startups, the offices of Powervault are a far cry from Tesla’s showpiece Californian stage. The similarity lies in the product – the Powervault battery, which stores energy from domestic solar panels. “Some people, especially if they don’t have solar panels, just assume solar panels come with a battery,” says Joe Warren, Powervault’s managing director. They don’t. Home energy generation has blossomed in the UK over the past four years, with an estimated 650,000 homes fitted with solar panels. In 2010, the government introduced the feed-in tariff scheme to pay householders who produce and supply energy. The scheme aims to push renewable energy in the UK towards 15% of total energy by 2020. In 2009, the figure stood at 2%. Powervault, Tesla and other players in the emerging solar battery market aim to supply the means for householders to store energy produced during the sunniest part of the day for use at peak times, when more people are at home but the sun is down. “A lot of people are not at home during the day, they are at work,” Warren says. “The solar system is generating energy which is all exported. We thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be great if you could store that energy and use it when you are at home in the evening?’ Our system stores energy during the day when it is sunny and then gives it back to the customer in the evening.” The Powervault unit is about the size of a washing machine and weighs about 150kg (330lbs). Inside are batteries, chargers and electronics. A charger takes the energy from the solar panels and transforms it into energy which is then stored in the batteries and discharged around the home when needed. “Typically the system works on a daily cycle so it charges up when it is sunny and then on that same day discharges,” Warren says. “It would typically store the energy for less than 24 hours. “It has a control system and a monitoring system which works out whether you are importing or exporting [electricity]. If you are exporting, it will charge the batteries until they are full and if it notices that you are importing electricity, it will start to discharge energy and reduce the amount of energy being imported from the grid by offsetting that with the energy in the battery.” The unit stores 2 to 4 kilowatt hours, enough energy to watch television for 14 or 28 hours or wash two to four full loads in the washing machine. Priced between £2,000 and £2,800 per unit, it is cheaper than rivals, says Warren, and it has been reduced in size to tailor it for the British home’s energy needs. “The main purpose is to reduce people’s electricity bills, to charge up during the day when it’s sunny, discharge it in the evening when people are using power. If you made the battery bigger, you could store the energy for longer but the problem with that is it would cost a lot more. What we have tried to do is size the unit so it is just right for a British house.” Savings from the device depend on consumption, the number of solar panels installed and how much energy they produce, although the company estimates that it could lower electricity bills by up to 15%. Warren said sales started in September, with devices snapped up by early adopters and people enthusiastic about green technology. Powervault is aiming to cut the cost to £1,000, making the savings on evolving battery technology and economies of scale. Warren says some estimates put the number of households with solar panels at 2m by 2020, by which time the company hopes to have sold 50,000 units. “What we are trying to do here is change the electricity market, change the way people consume energy,” says Warren. “The country and everybody [in it] are facing big challenges, we have got huge electricity cost increases that are affecting homeowners, are affecting the country. We need to get the carbon emissions of the country down, we need to ensure security of supply – all those things affect people and affect the country as a whole.” However, competition is expected to be harsh. Tesla’s wall-mounted Powerwall batteries are designed to store up to 10kW hours of wind or solar energy; units have sold out until mid-2016. It aims to have its batteries in the UK by the end of this year. Last month, Mercedes-Benz also entered the battery market for home and business use. Eco-entrepreneur Dale Vince, chair of the renewable energy firm Ecotricity, said the home battery market remained undeveloped until now because energy had been “too cheap for too long for it to matter”. Ecotricity is also developing a product – expected to be launched next year – with a working title of “black box”, a 2ft to 3ft-high device that will control power coming in and out of the home. The missing link Energy storage has been described as the missing link of solar energy adoption. A report from Deutsche Bank this year said solar energy storage would be cheap enough to be deployed on a large scale within five years as a result of a yearly cost reduction of 20% to 30% in the price of lithium-ion batteries. • You can read our archive of The innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/nov/14/hostels-to-high-end-the-australian-hotels-embracing-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-14T00:36:43Z","webTitle":"Hostels to high-end: the Australian hotels embracing renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/nov/14/hostels-to-high-end-the-australian-hotels-embracing-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/nov/14/hostels-to-high-end-the-australian-hotels-embracing-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Hostels to high-end: the Australian hotels embracing renewable energy","bodyText":"When it comes to the carbon impact of holidays, the focus has long been on the journey, not the destination. Yet a growing stable of accommodation providers in Australia are on a mission to change that, switching over en masse to renewable energy in a bid to attract eco-conscious holidaymakers. Hospitality operators are cottoning on to the fact that the natural features that draw tourists in also have the potential to power their hotels and hostels – from the solar and tidal capacity of beach getaways to the wind and geothermal power potential of mountainside hot spring resorts. Dozens of destinations have taken up solar PV in recent years, such as Lady Elliot Island Eco Resort in Queensland, which promotes its solar as part of an effort to save the Great Barrier Reef that guests are coming to visit, or the 1.8MW of solar panels installed at Ayers Rock Resort (with assistance of financing from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation) in a bid to capitalise on the desert heat. Tucked away in the Bass Strait separating mainland Australia from Tasmania, ecotourism destination Flinders Island is installing a tidal energy system to make the most of the waves that batter its coastline. Representing the wind sector is Wolgan Valley Resort up in the Blue Mountains near Sydney, where a turbine pumps water for guests from a nearby dam. Thomas Hillig, the managing director of THEnergy sustainable consulting, says the more far-flung holiday destinations of Australia are leading the way for a very practical reason – guests don’t want their downtime disrupted by noisy small-scale fossil fuel power sources. “At remote hotels that generate their power onsite with diesel generators, the advantages of renewables are most obvious,” he says. “Diesel gensets are loud and emit hazardous exhaust gas. In addition, trucks that transport the diesel to the hotel cause additional annoyance. “Wind and especially solar energy are clean and less noisy than diesel gensets. After they are constructed, fuel deliveries are not required.” Of course, just because the green credentials of the destination are suddenly a factor, it doesn’t mean the journey no longer counts and such remote destinations tend to involve long gas-guzzling car voyages or extended carbon-intensive flights. More accessible physically if not financially, high-end urban accommodations with the budget to do so are also going green, such as the solar thermal-powered Accor Group hotels at Sydney Olympic Park. Outside the luxury market, hostel chain YHA Australia has found a way to invest in renewables on a budget by following in the carbon footsteps of airlines that allow customers the option of paying extra to offset the emissions of flights. YHA’s Tom Smith says guests can opt to chip in towards the chain’s sustainability efforts, pointing to recent efforts by Sydney Harbour YHA as an example. “They’ve won award after award for sustainability and they’ve installed a great new PV solar panel system only in the last month or so – the panels were installed with 50% funding from YHA’s Sustainable Hostels Fund, which is generated by guests’ donations and matched dollar-for-dollar by YHA,” he says. Donations from the fund have gone towards solar hot water systems at YHA locations at Adelaide Central, Byron Bay, Cairns Central, Glebe Point, Pittwater, Grampians Eco Lodge, Melbourne Metro and Alice Springs. YHA has also been active on the sustainable front in New Zealand, where their hostel servicing the bubbling mud pools of Rotorua harnesses geothermal energy through a down-bore heat exchanger. The New Zealand YHA has also not forgotten about the journey, with its Low Carbon Traveller initiative having given away over 4,000 discounted nights to backpackers travelling on foot or by bike since 2011. Such efforts could prove lucrative for the hostel chain – the 2013 study Green Retail and Hospitality Report – Waste Management by McGraw-Hill Construction found that the core business of hotels is positively affected by green efforts. Hillig, whose THEnergy consultancy offers workshop and marketing programs to businesses within the hospitality and renewable-energy sectors globally, cautions that, despite all the progress down under, the region is by no means a world leader. “What we have not seen so far is a commitment from a hotel chain to fully switch to renewables such as the Melia group has done in Europe,” he says. He also thinks that the marketing potential of green energy in the tourism industry has not yet been fully harnessed by those taking it up. “The use of renewable energy also offers a great opportunity regarding communication and allows for attracting new target groups,” he says. “However, we see that many hotels do not play that card very actively. “Especially chains seem to be aware that they are still at the beginning of a development and that active communication on their first flagship renewable energy projects might raise questions regarding other establishments where they have not done anything yet.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2016/oct/27/10-years-on-from-the-stern-report-a-low-carbon-future-is-the-only-one-available","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-27T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"10 years on from the Stern report: a low-carbon future is the 'only one available'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/27/10-years-on-from-the-stern-report-a-low-carbon-future-is-the-only-one-available","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/oct/27/10-years-on-from-the-stern-report-a-low-carbon-future-is-the-only-one-available","fields":{"headline":"10 years on from the Stern report: a low-carbon future is the 'only one available'","bodyText":"Clean, green development is the sole route to future global economic growth, according to British economist Lord Nicholas Stern, with a continuation of polluting, high-carbon growth only leading to self-destruction. There is a strong argument that China is now leading the world in action on climate change, Stern said, making the country both a competitor and inspiration for other nations. Stern, speaking ahead of two lectures to mark the 10th anniversary of the highly influential Stern report, said the cost of not acting to halt global warming had risen while the costs of doing so had fallen. The 2006 Stern report, commissioned by the UK government, found that the economic damage caused by unchecked climate change could be 5-20% of global GDP each year, but that cutting carbon emissions would cost just 1% of GDP. The report warned against delaying action, but this has not been heeded, said Stern on Thursday. “We have delayed action,” he said. “The potential damages now look bigger than I suggested then. In that sense I underplayed the consequences of not getting on with it. But the costs of action are a good deal lower than I indicated then, in that technical progress has been faster that we thought. The cost of solar power [for example] is not far off a factor of 10 less than in 2006.” Today, he said, a low-carbon future is the sole option for prosperity. “It is the only one available and it is a very exciting growth story,” Stern said. “Any attempt to follow high-carbon growth will eventually be self destructive due to the very hostile environment it creates. There was an old alleged tension between growth on the one hand and climate responsibility on the other, but it’s a completely fake horse race.” Stern said other drivers of economic growth, such as using interest rates, tax changes and structural reforms, had limited potential. “Sustainable development of infrastructure and cities is the growth story of the future,” he said. “We are winning the arguments intellectually and politically, but it has all been much too slow.” Stern foresees economies in which people travel using efficient self-driving cars, bicycles and walking, homes and businesses are powered by green energy, materials are widely recycled and ultrafast broadband supports home working. “It is a very attractive future if we just put our minds to it,” he said. “Cities where you can’t move and breathe make no sense.” Stern said China could be seen as the leader in climate action today. “You can make a strong case for that,” he said, noting Chinese coal use peaked two years ago. “You have radical change in energy and very big structural change in the economy, moving very strongly towards service sectors and high-tech.” He said a key driver is the threat to China from fossil fuel burning, both in terms of climate change impacts, particularly droughts and floods, and air pollution. “I wish the whole world had known [in 2006] how big an issue air pollution was. We kill millions a year, so delay on that has resulted in probably the deaths of tens of millions of people,” he said. “The double gain – both reducing the risk of climate change and reducing air pollution – is now seen as a very powerful and attractive argument for action. This argument has been particularly strong in its attraction in China, which has probably moved the most in the last 10 years.” Stern said China was also driven by the desire to be the biggest player in the green economy: “If there is a race in green products, China rather fancies itself to do well.” China already leads the world in wind and solar energy installations and also has a major nuclear power programme. “The future of nuclear will be determined in China as it is the only country doing it at scale,” Stern said, suggesting 100-150 new nuclear power plants could be built there in the next 15-20 years. The UK has been a leader on climate change, he said, both in its pioneering domestic laws passed in 2008 and in international negotiations towards the global Paris climate change agreement. “But the UK wobbled in 2015 in terms of support for renewables and that has created some uncertainty,” he said. Since coming to power, the Conservative government has drastically cut or ended subsidies for wind and solar power, leading the UK to fall down league tables ranking national energy sectors and attractiveness for renewable energy investment. Stern said all low-carbon energy technologies, including nuclear, would be needed in the UK but that “solar and wind with storage is particularly promising”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2016/aug/22/alec-enterprise-car-rental-environmental-laws","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-22T13:00:04Z","webTitle":"Enterprise Rent-A-Car becomes paid Alec member despite green efforts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/alec-enterprise-car-rental-environmental-laws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/alec-enterprise-car-rental-environmental-laws","fields":{"headline":"Enterprise Rent-A-Car becomes paid Alec member despite green efforts","bodyText":"It’s not easy enough being green for Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Though the auto rental service has trumpeted tree-planting initiatives and its fleet of hybrid vehicles, the Guardian has learned that Enterprise recently became a paying member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), the business consortium that sends legislators prefabricated drafts of laws tailored to obscure scientific discovery that might damage its members’ revenues, and help those members avoid environmental regulations. The Center for Media and Democracy’s Nick Surgey brought Enterprise’s membership in Alec to the Guardian’s attention. Surgey said that Enterprise initially claimed not to know about Alec’s positions on renewable energy and that he found those claims “frankly implausible”. “For us, the argument over whether global warming is a problem or not is over,” said Andy Taylor, at the time Enterprise’s CEO, in 2007. By contrast, the group of conservative businesses published an article called “A Review of Global Warming Science” expressing skepticism and promoted an article by the Competitive Enterprise Institute that same year that said there was “no ‘scientific consensus’ [quotes theirs] that global warming will cause damaging climate change.” Climate models characterized as inaccurate by climate change skeptics are currently accurately predicting changes in ocean heat accumulation. Alec has also vigorously attacked sustainable energy programs, proposing financial penalties for people who supply solar energy to their neighborhoods. Enterprise is a subsidiary of Enterprise Holdings, the company that also owns the auto rental services Alamo and National. Enterprise confirmed to the Guardian that the company pays for the anti-regulatory group’s advocacy to lawmakers. The company’s given reason was the avoidance of specific sales taxes. Spokeswoman Laura T Bryant said: “[P]lease understand that our relationship with Alec is solely focused on the car rental excise tax issue.” “As the world’s largest car rental company and a leader in the global travel industry, we are in a strong position to help drive sustainable travel solutions and policies around the globe,” writes Enterprise Holdings CEO Pam Nicholson in the letter that opens Enterprise’s 2015 sustainability report, which lists Enterprise’s accomplishments in the realm of renewable and sustainable energy. “That’s why customers and employees look to us to be responsible stewards of our business and the communities where we live and work.” In 2013, the Guardian revealed that Alec had promoted legislation financially penalizing people who installed solar panels on their homes, including charging homeowners with solar power for feeding electricity back into the grid where it could be used by other people. “They should be paying to distribute the surplus electricity,” Alec analyst John Eick said at the time. Last year, Alec brass told the group’s annual conference that reports of the decline of insect pollinators due to pesticides was overblown in a talk called “Beepocalypse Not” in San Diego. In February, a United Nations report jointly authored by dozens of experts from across the world found that exposure to pesticides and saturation in pesticides was a “well-established” cause of decline in populations of pollinators such as bees. Several high-profile donors including Ford, BP and Expedia have left the group despite its hardcore anti-tax stances. Enterprise wants to avoid taxes on car rentals; local politicians often tout those taxes as a way to transfer part of the tax burden from local residents to tourists and businesses in the area temporarily."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/may/24/favelas-solar-energy-projects-brazil","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-24T11:06:43Z","webTitle":"From the favelas: the rise of rooftop solar projects in Brazil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/24/favelas-solar-energy-projects-brazil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/24/favelas-solar-energy-projects-brazil","fields":{"headline":"From the favelas: the rise of rooftop solar projects in Brazil","bodyText":"Sunny days have long been considered a competitive advantage for Brazil. Before the 2014 World Cup, the country’s tourist board set up a website allowing visitors to compare the number of sunny days in US and European capitals to cities in Brazil (eg Brussels 103, Rio de Janeiro 212). But while tourism may have been capitalising on the sunshine, the solar industry has not. According to statistics from the Brazilian electricity regulatory agency, Aneel, solar accounts for just 0.02% of the country’s energy. The bulk of the country’s energy generation (70%) is from hydropower. However, while demand for energy is increasing, multi-year droughts and widespread blackouts have created serious concerns about energy security for millions of businesses and homes. Despite a traditional lack of support (unlike Europe, China and the US, Brazil has not implemented feed-in tariffs or tax breaks), the government is now making efforts to diversify (pdf) the country’s energy mix with recent public auctions for solar and wind. Its 10-year energy plan released in 2014 estimates that 7GW of solar projects will be installed by 2024, making up 3.3% of Brazil’s energy mix. Yet as Brazil struggles with deep recession, increasing public deficit and political paralysis, it could be smaller companies and social startups that fuel the spread of solar, especially in the favelas where access to electricity is not widespread. Boost for community solar New regulations that came into effect in March aim to clear the way to make people into both consumers and producers of clean, low-cost electricity. They allow people to set up co-operatives to install grid-connected solar systems and be financially rewarded for contributions to the grid. The regulations also seek to cut red tape by simplifying and speeding up procedures for setting up and connecting solar systems. One organisation likely to be a key beneficiary of the new regulations is Revolusolar. Located in Babilônia, a Rio de Janeiro favela in the Leme region of the city, it was founded in 2015 by a group of six local residents, aiming to bring green power to the people of the favela. Currently a non-profit, Revolusolar is hoping to become a co-operative later this year and is already supported by the Organization of Cooperatives in Brazil. “We live in an energy dictatorship dominated by big companies like [Brazilian oil giant] Petrobras. But this might soon change,” says Revolusolar co-founder Pol Dhuyvetter from the roof of his house, where he has just installed a set of 12 solar panels that he expects will supply 50% of his energy consumption. So far, 10 families have contacted the organisation to evaluate the eligibility of their homes for the grid-connected solar electric system. “It is difficult to understand how a country with such potential is not developing its solar energy system,” says Dhuyvetter. Solar’s promise for Brazil If panels were installed on the rooftops of every house in the country, solar energy could supply more than double the Brazilian residential demand, according to Rodrigo Sauaia, president of the Brazilian Solar Power Association (Absolar). He believes that the new regulations – for the first time establishing clear rules for community solar - combined with skyrocketing electricity costs due to droughts and over-dependence on hydropower energy will stimulate distributed generation in the coming years. “In 2015 we had only 1,731 small-scale solar systems connected to the grid, but we expect this number to grow to 1.2m in 2024,” he says. Environmental and social organisations such as Greenpeace have recently campaigned to push the Brazilian government to provide tax breaks for panels and loans to buy solar equipment, as high interest rates – currently 14.25% – threaten investment in renewables that take time to pay off. “There is a degree of reluctance from the government, but also a strong lobby [against solar] from major construction companies that finance political campaigns,” says Barbara Rubim, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace Brazil. These companies, some of which have an interest in the construction of huge, controversial dams such as the Belo Monte, have also become one focus of the country’s Lava Jato corruption investigation. Sauaia is confident society and small- and medium-sized companies will lead the charge. One such innovative small business is Sao Paulo-based Axis Renovaveis, which offers clients a solution to cut their energy bills: install tailor-made solar systems on their rooftops without investing a single cent. “We just ask them to sign a 10- to 12-year contract to commit to buy the electricity produced by the solar system, which could represent up to 50% of their total demand,” says Luiz Pacheco, one of the company founders. “We guarantee a cheaper price than the market and we assume all financing, installation and maintenance costs.” Axis Renovaveis has funding from banks and private investors to cover upfront costs. Pacheco argues that commercial clients – such as a major pharmacy retailer network – benefit from a 15% discount in their electricity expenses compared with previous bills. This creates an opportunity for a booming expansion of Pacheco’s business. “[Clients] have realised that they can easily save money in each of their hundreds of branches in the country. At the same time, they also contribute to the environment.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2017/feb/07/why-coal-fired-power-handouts-would-be-an-attack-on-climate-and-common-sense","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-07T00:48:42Z","webTitle":"Why coal-fired power handouts would be an attack on climate and common sense","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/07/why-coal-fired-power-handouts-would-be-an-attack-on-climate-and-common-sense","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/feb/07/why-coal-fired-power-handouts-would-be-an-attack-on-climate-and-common-sense","fields":{"headline":"Why coal-fired power handouts would be an attack on climate and common sense","bodyText":"The recent coordinated push for new coal-powered electricity generators in Australia comes as the industry is on its last legs. The intensified push for government handouts can be seen as a last-ditch attempt for the coal industry to squeeze some money out of the unwise investments it made at the end of the mining boom. Here are the facts and figures that point towards that conclusion. The coal industry knows that to stop runaway climate change all coal-powered generators need to close Australia joined 174 countries and the European Union in 2015, signing the Paris agreement. In doing so, Australia agreed to do its part in keeping the global temperature rise “well below” 2C. It also commits countries to achieving net-zero emissions “in the second half of this century”. That agreement, designed to stop runaway climate change, requires that all of Australia’s coal-fired generators close. According to the International Energy Agency, OECD countries such as Australia need to shut down almost all of their coal-fired power stations by about 2035. And the rest of the world will need to phase out coal power by 2050, it says. With coal-fired power stations taking up to a decade to build, and designed to last 30 or 40 years, building new ones now is obviously inconsistent with those commitments. In particular, Australia has committed to reducing its emissions by 26% below 2005 levels by 2030 – a commitment that is not strong enough to limit global warming at 2C and will need to be “ratcheted up”. But the Australian government recently released projections of the country’s carbon emissions showing that current policies are going to cause emissions to rise to 2030, not drop, leaving Australia overshooting that commitment by a long way. In producing those projections, the Department of Environment and Energy assumed that 2,000MW of coal capacity would retire between 2020 and 2030, and that the generation would be taken up by existing coal and some gas. (That’s equivalent to about two large power stations.) If, instead, even more coal is built, the already rising emissions would get even worse. Demand for coal for electricity has been dropping Meanwhile, even before coal generators begin to close, the demand for their power has been dropping as renewables enter the mix. According to data from the Office of the Chief Economist, the demand for coal-generated electricity has dropped by more than 15% in the past eight years. Moreover, New South Wales budget papers show that the state government has recently downgraded its projections for domestic consumption by a whopping 20%. Last year it estimated domestic consumption would be 30m tonnes a year for the next five years. This year it changed that estimate to just 24m tonnes each year. In response to the new figures, the NSW Greens’ energy spokesman, Jeremy Buckingham, said: “Coal power has been in decline for nearly a decade and it is clear that no one is going to build a new coal-fired power station anywhere in Australia. “Coal is the whale oil of the 21st century and should be phased out as rapidly as possible for the sake of the climate.” New coal is the most expensive form of energy While the proponents of coal talk about coal power being “cheap and reliable”, they are wrong on both fronts. Coal is now the most expensive form of new power. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the cost of energy from a new coal power plant would be $134-$203/MWh. That’s more expensive than wind, solar or highly efficient combined-cycle gas (costing $61-$118/MWh, $78-$140/MWh and $74-$90/MWh, respectively). Coal is not ‘reliable’ anymore Whether or not an energy source is “reliable” depends on what you’re relying on it for. The only people who still think we need the old-fashioned sort of “baseload power” that coal provides – power that is always running regardless of whether you need it – are those in the coal industry. Coal power stations are slow to start up and so can’t respond efficiently to fluctuations in supply and demand. Old energy systems were built assuming coal would always be running. It was the “baseload” energy and other forms of energy such as gas would switch on to satisfy the peaks in demand. In a world where wind and solar energy can produce a lot of energy, but not constantly, baseload needs to be replaced with flexible power that can smooth out the spiky energy supply created by variable sources of renewable energy. In the short term, that can be gas. But, in the longer term, to stop runaway climate change, that service will need to be supplied by renewable sources such as battery storage, hydro, solar thermal with storage or geothermal. When competing with renewables, coal generators end up burning costly fuel, even when they are giving the electricity away for free. Leonard Quong from Bloomberg New Energy Finance said when releasing a recent report: “In the grid of the not-too-distant future coal’s baseload operation becomes a curse, not a blessing.” And Steven Holliday, the chief executive of the UK’s National Grid, recently said: “The idea of baseload power is already outdated.” The coalmining industry has a backlog of projects it can’t get off the ground According to the Office of the Chief Economist’s most recent Resources and Energy Major Projects Report, there are 37 major coalmining projects that are currently in the works. However, that number has dropped since the last report a year ago and, in that time, no new projects have moved from along the pipeline from being “committed” to “completed”. If all the projects still listed as being actively pursued were to reach completion, they would produce almost 300m tonnes of coal each year. Adam Walters from Energy &amp; Resource Insights said that list is a “salient reminder, if one is needed, that vast amounts of proposed new coal capacity, much with most approvals in place, remains waiting for a favourable market”. He said most of those projects were begun during the mining boom, when commodity prices were high. With prices depressed, they’ve stayed on the books but are not progressing. The push for rejuvenating the coal industry with government subsidies is the sort of thing that could help the industry get some of these projects back on track, Walters said. The global coal industry recently saw its biggest player, Peabody, go bankrupt in the US. If companies are forced to take write-downs for these projects by admitting they will never go ahead, it could mean the end for some of the companies. At his National Press Club address last week, Malcolm Turnbull appeared to point to this as the reason he is now looking to subsidise the most expensive and dirtiest form of energy, saying that it could help our mining industry. He said: “As the world’s largest coal exporter, we have a vested interest in showing that we can provide both lower emissions and reliable baseload power with state-of-the-art, clean, coal-fired technology.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/oct/08/brighton-solar-powered-buses-electric","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-08T07:00:36Z","webTitle":"Brighton gears up for new fleet of solar-powered buses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/08/brighton-solar-powered-buses-electric","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/08/brighton-solar-powered-buses-electric","fields":{"headline":"Brighton gears up for new fleet of solar-powered buses","bodyText":"The bright yellow Big Lemon buses are a familiar sight – and smell – on the roads of Brighton and Hove. For nine years the Community Interest Company has run all its vehicles on waste cooking oil from local restaurants, recycled into biodiesel, but now it wants to go one step further. The Big Lemon wants to install solar panels on the roof of its east Brighton depot, storing the energy in batteries and charging buses overnight. It is working with the Brighton Energy Cooperative (BEC) towards a vision of zero emissions bus services in every UK community by 2030, using Brighton as a pilot. The Big Lemon eventually wants to replace its 10 biodiesel buses, which are not suitable for conversion, and has already raised £250,000 of investment in a bond issue to do this, exceeding the original target of £100,000. The company has also been shortlisted for the M&amp;S Energy Community Energy Fund, which could bring up to £25,000 through a public vote and pledged donations from voters – the cost of the solar panel installation at the depot. The project is currently leading votes in the south and more than £9,490 has been pledged. UK’s first solar buses Although this is the first UK initiative of its kind, there are examples of electric buses across the country, including in London and Harrogate. The government has put £30m of funding towards helping bus operators and local authorities in England run more low-emission buses. “Electric bus technology has progressed quite far. We wanted to try that and embrace it,” says Tom Druitt, managing director of The Big Lemon. Biodiesel has a low carbon footprint but there are still emissions from the buses. Using electricity means almost no emissions. The key thing about The Big Lemon idea is that the energy will be generated on site. “If we run on mains electricity then we still have a large carbon footprint,” says Druitt, who is also a Green party councillor. The Big Lemon has decided to convert diesel buses to run on electric, instead of buying brand new electric buses. Work has begun on the first buses which were purchased for £20,000 each. With conversion costs of £140,000 each, Druitt says this approach is still cost effective as, depending on the brand, a new electric bus would cost between £250,000 and £500,000. Conversion also allows the company to have more say in the bus’s specifications. Druitt estimates that The Big Lemon will save around £20,000 a year in fuel costs, as well as a reduction in maintenance costs. “We’ve estimated that there’s a six-year payback on these buses and we’re calculating for an eight-year life span, so essentially we get two years free,” he explains. The panels for the initial project will generate 30,000kWh of electricity and will power the whole of the 52 route between Woodingdean and Brighton city centre. The Big Lemon wants to power all five of its routes this way eventually while its coach fleet, used for longer distances, will continue to use waste cooking oil due to a lack of available technology. Can it be replicated? How easy will this idea be to replicate elsewhere? Chris Jardine, technical director of solar energy experts Joju Solar, says that in theory it should be easy. “I think the intricacies will be in whether you can get enough energy from the solar to fully power the fleet,” he says. “It may be easy in summer, while in the middle of winter you might be getting five times less electricity out of your solar panels. “By not putting it into the grid it makes it a bit more difficult as you come across this commonly found issue with renewables, that they’re intermittent,” says Will Cottrell, chairman of BEC. “You need to think quite hard about how it works technically,” he adds, explaining that getting the right size battery and overall system is key to providing the right level of supply. “But this is the way it’s got to be,” he says. “To move us away from a centralised energy system we need to move away from a centralised grid as well, so we need to understand the technology that is going to enable us to do that.” The plan for The Big Lemon is to produce enough energy in the winter, and an excess in summer but it will have a mains backup if needed. The team can then use any excess energy in the summer to give energy to the building. “I think our independence, background and philosophy generally makes it easier for us to try these things,” says Druitt. “That’s what all our stakeholders signed up for really, we don’t have an angry mob in an AGM.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2015/aug/27/fossil-fuels-workers-retraining-carbon-neutral-solar-wind-energy-oil-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"What will happen to oil and gas workers as the world turns carbon neutral?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/aug/27/fossil-fuels-workers-retraining-carbon-neutral-solar-wind-energy-oil-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2015/aug/27/fossil-fuels-workers-retraining-carbon-neutral-solar-wind-energy-oil-gas","fields":{"headline":"What will happen to oil and gas workers as the world turns carbon neutral?","bodyText":"Adriaan Kamp used to be a die-hard oilman. After 17 years at Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell, the 54-year-old Dutchman now runs a consultancy based in Oslo advising national governments on transitioning to cleaner energy. “In 2007 to 2008, we were looking at future energy scenarios in the Shell Group [and] there was a question on my desk about how do we play with renewables,” he says. “And from there, the journey started.” If the energy sector is to become carbon neutral by 2070, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change insists must happen to avoid a temperature rise of more than two degrees celsius, hundreds of thousands of workers will need to follow Kamp’s lead. The renewable sector in Europe alone could produce 6.1m new jobs by 2050, according to trade union Sustainlabour. By the same token, divestment in coal, oil and gas, and other carbon-intensive sectors could lead to a massive shake-up elsewhere in the global labour market. Industry skills In terms of skills, transitioning from old to new energy sectors should be comparatively straightforward. There’s “no magic” to renewable technologies, says Kamp. “Managing a wind farm or solar project is nothing a good oil and gas man who has built or organised facilities cannot manage,” he says. Sophie Bennett, policy officer for RenewableUK, agrees. Many of the technical and managerial needs of the low-carbon energy sector are similar to those in traditional energy and power industries, she says. But despite high demand for such expertise in the renewables sector, the transfer of skilled labour from fossil fuel sectors remains a trickle. If that’s to increase, governments need to make firm commitments and establish a long-term vision in support of energy transition, Bennett argues. “Policy uncertainty on renewables can hinder expenditure on skills by the industry. Plus, the skills interventions that are needed – such as apprenticeships and education outreach programmes – can require a long incubation period,” she says. The low-carbon sector itself is making small inroads with respect to the skills it needs. In the UK, for instance, the renewable training network provides training courses for technical, engineering and business roles. German engineering giant Siemens, meanwhile, offers a two-year training programme to equip graduates for work in the wind industry. Few equivalents can be found in fossil fuel industries. There’s a partial exception in the mining sector: mining firm Anglo American, headquartered in London, has a formal mine closure policy that includes employee reskilling and retraining. However, such re-employment schemes rarely direct workers specifically to the low-carbon energy sector. The UK’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) marks a rare attempt to do so. As part of a five-year retraining programme ahead of the anticipated decommissioning of two nuclear power stations in north Wales, workers were offered courses to obtain professional certificates valid in the renewable sector. Almost 9% of the 534 participating employees chose to do so. Gerallt Llewelyn Jones, managing director of Menter Môn Cyf, which administered the retraining on behalf of the NDA, believes all carbon-intensive industries should be obliged to offer employees retraining in line with government decarbonisation targets. “If it can be done in nuclear, then it should be done in the equally wealthy fossil fuel sector,” he says. Government responsibility Even in the event of such a system, many believe that governments need to take the lead, not industry. “It’s public authorities’ responsibility to create the policy and investment framework where energy transition will take place,” says Benjamin Denis, policy adviser on climate change at the European Trade Union Confederation. “Companies of course have a responsibility, but I don’t expect Shell or BP to take voluntary initiatives to pay attention to workers impacted by the transition.”Decarbonisation is an emotive issue for many labour unions. Earlier this year German trade unions threatened mass mobilisation in the wake of aggressive energy transition plans. Denis maintains that clean energies are not yet a “job killer”, but insists governments must provide training programmes to avoid them becoming so in the future. “We can’t decarbonise the economy, which is still massively fossil fuel-based, without changing the labour market. That’s why we are calling for a just transition,” he says. Examples of government-led integrated training strategies remain scant, however. Those that do exist, such as in Denmarkand Scotland, tend to be relatively small scale and locally targeted. A recent OECD study of green skills provision in Europe confirms that many governments’ green skills policies are “uncertain and fragmented”. Fuelling the current disarray is a lack of data on the types of jobs that employers in low-carbon industries will need in the future. The OECD advises governments to integrate green skills into mainstream education, rather than creating separate systems of training. It also recommends a focus on transferal skills rather than on occupation-specific training. As for financing such programmes, the European Commission says money is already there in existing green-growth funds. In its green employment initiative (pdf), released in 2014, it singles out pots such as the European social fund and the European development fund. In the US, meanwhile, training providers and industries can access a variety of federal government grants for green skills initiatives. Trade unions, however, argue that additional funds should also be found to support communities that will be especially hard-hit by a shift to cleaner energy – such as North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany and Poland’s Silesia, which are both highly dependent on coal production. “In such regions, if you do not organise a strong social protection system, decarbonisation will have dramatic effects on the workforce and the communities,” says Denis, adding that such a system falls to local authorities, national governments and the EU to create jointly. Back in Oslo, former oilman Kamp welcomes any attempts governments can make to inspire people to pursue careers in clean energy sectors. “Creating an image of the renewable industry as an exciting career has to be a good thing,” he says. “But, at the end, there needs to be a job market that delivers it.” Sign up here for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.

It is estimated that it will grow to 24m jobs worldwide by 2030 – up from 9.2m reported in 2014 – according to analysis by the International Renewable Energy Industry (Irena), which predicts that doubling the proportion of renewables in the global energy mix would increase GDP by up to $1.3tn across the world. The rise and rise of the solar industry has been the largest driver of growth. In 2014, it accounted for more than 2.5m jobs, largely in operations, maintenance and manufacturing – now increasingly dominated by a jobs boom in Asia. The industry is providing hope and income to workers – present and future – across the global south. Sheila Mbilishi, ‘solar-preneur’, Zambia Although employment in renewable energy is comparatively low across Africa, the sunny continent is where the need and potential for employment is perhaps greatest. A fast-growing economy and population is driving demand for energy, but two-thirds of people in sub-Saharan Africa still lack access to electricity. Now the renewables revolution is witnessing the rise of a generation of African “solar-preneurs” who are creating small-scale businesses by taking solar energy – in the form of lights, radios and mobile-phone charging facilities – into local communities. In western Zambia, Sheila Mbilishi is self-employed and sells solar lights to local residents and businesses. The 67-year-old widow and mother of six buys the lights for $5 from the social enterprise SunnyMoney – part of the UK based charity SolarAid – and sells them on with a 50% profit margin. “They sell like cupcakes,” says Mbilishi. “There is life in the lights – people got interested in them.” They are popular with pupils who want to study after dark, businesses during electricity blackouts or as a replacement for toxic kerosene lamps in homes. Since starting the business three years ago, it has provided Mbilishi with a significant source of income, helping her to open a shop and build a two-bedroom flat. “The difference is huge,” she says. “Selling lights has helped me a lot. I have built a house out of the lights. Owning personal ones has helped me too with the current load shedding – electricity is usually off and I am not affected by no light.” Shehak Sattar, renewable energy student, Moscow For Shehak Sattar, choosing to study renewable energy was more a social than a personal decision. “I want to practise something different from the mainstream. It is related to the concept of believing in humanity and our survival on earth,” he says. The 27-year-old Pakistani student is now four months into a masters degree in the science and materials of solar energy at the National University of Science and Technology in Moscow, funded by a scholarship. The course is in its first year and has mostly attracted international students – from Afghanistan and Iran to Nigeria and Namibia. Before coming to Moscow, Sattar worked for NGOs and other agencies in Pakistan, installing and spreading the transmission of solar energy to remote communities and to slums in Islamabad and Lahore. Larger solar projects are now starting to come online in Pakistan, amid ambitions to construct the world’s largest solar farm. “There has been a general electricity crisis in Pakistan. People are waiting for alternatives to rescue them from this suffering,” he says. Once he has completed his course, Sattar wants to work at a university in Pakistan “to convert the attention of students to renewable energy sources” by lecturing and researching methods to make solar energy more efficient. “We have to fight more,” he says. “We have to fight against the people who will be digging for petroleum in the coming 20 years because it will destroy our ecology’s balance.” Mohamed Abdikadir, solar panel installer, Dadaab, Kenya The promise of renewable energy in refugee camps could save humanitarian agencies hundreds of millions of dollars and provide job opportunities for thousands of young refugees. Mohamed Abdikadir, 21, was born in the refugee camp complex at Dadaab in eastern Kenya, where the average family spends $17.20 per month – 24% of their income – on energy. The complex is home to more than 330,000 refugees. Like most of his neighbours, Abdikadir’s family came to the camp after fleeing the civil war in Somalia more than two decades ago. Both his parents have since died, leaving Abdikadir to provide for his 10 younger siblings. He is now one of 5,000 young people trained to install solar panels as part of a programme in Kenya and Ethiopia organised by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), which has recruited local teachers to deliver it. “It was hard [to learn] at first but I tried my best and now it is easy,” says Abdikadir. After completing a six-month programme a year ago, he gets up at 5am every day to pray before preparing breakfast and collecting the tools for his job in Dadaab’s dry desert landscape. “There is a lot of sun here. Renewable energy is very good in this environment.” Before he started the programme, Abdikadir earned money by selling water but he could only make enough to provide one meal a day for his family. Now, with the extra income from solar installations – $10 on an average day – his siblings are eating three meals daily, have new clothing and are able to attend a fee-paying school. “I am the breadwinner of the family,” he says. “[The programme] has really helped me. Before I was idle. It helps with my daily bread, my daily income.” Abdikadir now wants to expand his education to incorporate other forms of renewable energy. Meanwhile, the NRC recently announced plans to deliver a similar programme on a larger scale for Syrians at Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan.

As of the end of last year, Toyota has sold more than 2m Prius hybrids, more than half of a total of 3.5m hybrid cars of all models in the US alone. Together, they are taking a big bite out of gasoline consumption and emissions: hybrids use about 50% less gas and generate half as many emissions as traditional cars. But now we have a new problem: batteries. Those nickel-metal hydride (Nimh) batteries still need to be collected and recycled, or reused at the end of their useful lives in vehicles. Toyota now collects more than 90% of its batteries, and is aiming for 100% collected. But what happens to the batteries after they’re collected? Some are recycled, but from an environmental perspective, it’s even better if they are reused. In my work as chief environmental officer for Toyota Motor Engineering &amp; Manufacturing North America, I helped create a second life for some of these Prius batteries – in Yellowstone National Park. In May, Toyota and Yellowstone flipped the switch on a new energy system at the park’s Lamar Buffalo Ranch field campus, which combines solar power with energy storage built on 208 Nimh batteries from old Toyota Camry Hybrids. This project came about in an unexpected way. Although I’d been working with a number of partners to make sure Toyota collected every Nimh battery we sold, our intent was to recycle those batteries rather than repurpose them. But while I was visiting a Nascar Green event in Chicago, I heard that Yellowstone National Park was using a gas-powered generator and lead-acid battery system to power its off-the-grid Lamar Buffalo Ranch center – a decidedly unsustainable energy system for an environmental education center. Because I’d worked with Yellowstone many times over the years to provide philanthropic contributions of Toyota vehicles to support park operations, I saw this as an opportunity to do the right thing for Yellowstone while also charting a path forward for Toyota’s operations. Energy was already a clear challenge for Toyota – you can’t be in manufacturing and not deal with rising energy costs. So I approached one of our energy experts to discuss if energy storage using old hybrid batteries was even feasible. “Technically, yes,” was the response. But plenty of complications remained. First and foremost, we had to decide what was most important for Toyota to learn from this venture. As an engineer by training, I wanted to know everything about everything – a great mindset if you’re working in the lab, but far too complicated in the field. So I sat down with my team to get a better idea of what we can do now, what it will take to get the system up and running, and what we needed to eliminate and revisit down the line. That was perhaps the hardest part of this project, and it’s true of almost any project: I tried to solve everything from the start. That caused problems right away – sometimes you simply can’t do everything. Eventually, I realized that cutting back my ambitions for the project was a blessing in disguise. Not only did streamlining the focus of the project help us move a lot faster, but it also put us in the long term mindset. Maybe I wasn’t going to be able to create a viable energy storage product for Toyota right out of the gate, but committing to evaluate and improve this system over time gave it a better chance of survival. An example of this is the process we followed to source our microinverters, the critically important components that convert the electricity generated by the solar panels to a form that can be stored in the batteries. As I discussed our needs with various potential partners, I kept our long term commitment in mind, knowing that we would not only need something custom-built for this project, but that it had to be something that could evolve and scale with us. In the end, we chose our partners for this project with an eye on not only the quality of their products, but also their willingness to take the long ride with us. As we continue our energy storage work, what I’ve learned has helped us smooth the path ahead – and it can help others who are starting down the path of research and development-led innovation. I’d boil it down to this: aim high, but start small, and keep your eyes on the long-term prize."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"news/2016/dec/26/this-is-possible-we-did-it-the-week-portugal-ran-on-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-26T08:00:37Z","webTitle":"'This is possible.

We did it': the week Portugal ran on renewables","bodyText":"If you can keep your gaze off the hilltops, imagine away the pylons and forget the occasional tractor of an uncertain vintage coughing along the narrow roads, little appears to have changed in the valleys of north-eastern Portugal for decades, perhaps even centuries. The gnarled alvarinho vines have been relieved of their fruit to make vinho verde, an old woman in black herds her sheep through a hamlet and hungry eagles hover over the fields, scanning the land for lunch. But look up, past the villages, the clumps of stout ponies and the wolf-haunted forests of pine, oak and eucalyptus, and the harbingers of an environmental revolution are silhouetted against the December sky. The 130 giant wind turbines that sprout from the peaks, slicing the air with a rhythmic sigh, have helped Portugal to a remarkable achievement. For four and a half days in May the country ran entirely on electricity from renewable sources: wind, hydro and solar power. Despite fears of a blackout, the lights stayed on for a record 107 hours between 6.45am on Saturday 7 May and 5.45pm the following Wednesday. Francisco Ferreira, president of the Portuguese environmental NGO Zero, got wind of what was going on when a friend called that weekend. “He said: ‘I’ve been looking at the graphs and for the past two days we’ve been 100% renewable on electricity production.’ After that, we looked at the data and arrived at 107 hours. We confirmed it with the national energy network, who said we’d had 4.5 days. “It was great to see that the system was working; to see that we could manage all these renewables even though the circumstances were quite challenging.” Ferreira and his fellow clean energy advocates hold up those few days as further proof that renewables can reliably replace fossil fuels. Things may have been helped along by the fact that a good chunk of the 107 hours fell over the weekend – when demand is lower – and by an unusually co-operative Mother Nature, who saw to it that the sun shone and the wind blew favourably. But supporters of renewable power insist it was down to much more than luck. António Sá da Costa, managing director of the Portuguese renewable energy association Apren, argues it was the result of years of investment and cooperation. “It was the coming together of three factors, without which none if it would have been possible,” he says. “The first was that we had the power plants in place to take advantage of the natural conditions during that period; second, it was only possible because of the wind, water and sun. The third was that we had the operational grid capability – in terms of both distribution and transportation – to manage this type of situation.” Yes, the timing was lucky, he adds. But that does not lessen the achievement of linking up hundreds of dispersed renewable power plants instead of taking the easier option of relying on production from one large thermal one. Or, to put it a little more pithily: “When Cristiano Ronaldo scores a goal, people say it was lucky. No. It wasn’t lucky. It was a lot of training, a lot of preparation and a lot of things. In our case it wasn’t just luck.” Sá da Costa traces Portugal’s interest in renewable energy back to 1970, when almost all the electricity consumed in the country was from renewable hydropower plants. However, as the country developed economically, demand outstripped supply, forcing it to look to more conventional sources. It wasn’t until the end of the last century when windfarms appeared in Madeira and, later, on the mainland, that people started to take renewables more seriously. Although Portugal has been a frontrunner on clean energy for more than a decade – Altos Minhos was Europe’s largest onshore windfarm when it opened eight years ago – the country’s weather and geography have yet to be fully harnessed. Portugal’s climate varies between wet and dry years. In wet years, hydropower is the main source of energy, followed by wind and coal. In dry years, however, coal is first, followed by wind and hydro. According to Apren’s figures, renewable energy has been responsible for 59% of national energy production during a wet 2016, with 41% from fossil fuels. Hydro power has yielded 32%, wind 25%, and solar close to 2%. Efforts to increase the renewable sector have been hit by Portugal’s economic crisis, which has spooked would-be investors and slowed growth. Sá de Costa and Ferreira both say the country has to do far more to exploit its thousands of annual hours of sunshine through the creation of more solar farms. “That’s the real push we need for the future,” says Ferreira. “In the winter, between November and June, hydro and wind can probably guarantee [things]. But from May or June to October and November, we could rely less on wind, and much less on hydro.” Despite the slowdown, Sá de Costa is bullish about Portugal’s capacity to comfortably meet and exceed EU targets for member states to have at least a 27% share of renewable energy consumption by 2030. With sufficient investment and construction – more windfarms and many more solar farms – he believes that Portugal could be on course to generate 60% of its energy through renewables by 2020 and 100% by 2040. Jorge Seguro Sanches, Portugal’s energy secretary, says the country is on track to see renewable energy accounting for 31% of its energy use by 2020. He also says the government is heavily promoting a solar power programme as part of its plans to reduce dependence on oil imports and foster the development of a sustainable technology hub. “In the past few years, we have seen a prosperous boom in windfarms,” he says. “Nevertheless, the market nowadays is oriented towards photovoltaic solar energy, as a result of its high technological development and the decline of investment costs. This is a new path for the near future, [and] will guarantee the sustainability of the Portuguese electricity system.” In the misty valleys of Alto Minho, the windfarm is gradually becoming part of the landscape. Long-horned barrosã cattle graze among the 80-metre-high turbines and seek out their shade in summer. Hunters in pursuit of boar, rabbits and birds still crisscross the hillsides but keep a respectful distance from the technicians who service the plant. Sometimes, the odd wolf is glimpsed far below the sweeping blades. For Sá da Costa, who has something of the glee of a prophet seeing his predictions coming true, those four and a half days in May were the best possible riposte to the naysayers. “Now no one can come along and say in good conscience that this is impossible. No. This is possible. Because we did it. And if we did it, it’s also possible in other countries. It’s just a question of finding how to do it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/jan/28/drax-power-station-energy-companies-women","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-28T16:00:04Z","webTitle":"Energy sector faces struggle to find the female engineers of the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/28/drax-power-station-energy-companies-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/jan/28/drax-power-station-energy-companies-women","fields":{"headline":"Energy sector faces struggle to find the female engineers of the future","bodyText":"While the lack of female chief executives in the UK is a problem, the lack of female engineers is an even bigger concern, as Dorothy Thompson, chief executive of Drax group, knows only too well. The head of the UK’s largest power station is grappling with the question of how to attract more women into the energy sector. Thompson says the six places available on the Drax apprenticeship scheme this year attracted just two female applicants compared with 76 men. The education is partly to blame, she says, but energy companies also need to do much more to change girls’ perceptions. Thompson has overseen Drax’s conversion of its coal-fired boilers to biomass to secure the future of the plant near Selby in North Yorkshire as environmental rules bite. She is one of a tiny pool of women running big UK companies, and an even smaller number at the top of the energy industry. The proportion of women on the boards of energy companies was 9% in 2014, and exactly the same two years later. The gender imbalance is not much better further down the management chain. “We would like to have more female apprentices, more female engineers. We believe in diversity,” she says. “But it is challenging. In our current [recruitment] process, there’s a real paucity of female candidates. We struggle to get sufficient candidates to increase the percentage [of women].” She says that while schools should do more to encourage girls to study science and subjects that could equip them for a career in energy, much of the responsibility in addressing the imbalance lies with the industry. “Part of it is in education but part of it is perception. We as an industry need to be more proactive in explaining how interesting an opportunity we are [to young women],” she says. Thompson is far from alone in recognising the imbalance or trying to do something about it. “This is a huge cultural issue for the industry,” says Joan MacNaughton, who is on the board of Powerful Women, a group helping females advance their career in the sector. “There are expectations of women that I don’t think are 21st century. It’s a very, very male culture.” MacNaughton, who spent five years at French company Alstom’s energy division and sits on the board of Energy Academy Europe, says even energy companies that like to think of themselves as progressive have a problem. “They’re not Jeremy Clarkson [the men]; they’re cultured, well-mannered people. But the assumption in senior circles is that you can all have a conversation about your yachts. As a woman there who doesn’t have a yacht, you just have to walk away.” EDF, which is building Britain’s first new nuclear power station in two decades, has been running a cinema ad campaign as part of its drive to encourage girls and young women to study disciplines that could lead to energy jobs. “To recruit the numbers needed to fulfil demand for the future, we need more girls to study science subjects at school, further education and higher education,” says the French company’s boss, Vincent de Rivaz, in a foreword to a recent EDF jobs report. Dr Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers agrees: “Often women don’t see heavy industry as a likely future career. Maybe it’s because of the way we talk about engineering and the way it’s shown on TV and talked about in schools.” The root of the problem is not just in education but society more widely, she adds. “When you’re a teenager you want to fit in, and society doesn’t say to girls, ‘yay, go out and build power plants’.” Sara Bell, founder of technology company Tempus Energy, says while it is still vital to encourage girls to study Stem subjects – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – the industry has to look at how it presents itself. “I used to work in financial markets, which is a pretty testosterone-fuelled environment. The energy sector makes finance look like an equal opportunities employer,” she says. “A lot of 15-year-old girls will look at the role models – middle-aged men, predominantly white – and not see anything they can relate to.” Drax’s Thompson agrees that the lack of role models is an issue. “It is unfortunate that there are not more senior women in energy, because it would make it appear more accessible to women. I think it’s unfortunate because the industry is in fact perfectly accessible.” Alice Gill should know. As a schoolgirl she was taken on a tour of the power station and now, at 22, after taking biology, maths, chemistry and physics A-levels, she has just completed a four-year apprenticeship scheme with Drax. “A lot of women are, like, girly girls, aren’t they?” she says. “I can’t imagine them coming in in overalls with no makeup on, and getting their hands dirty. It’s not necessarily a problem with the industry [the lack of women]; I think the problem is that people just aren’t interested.” The solution, she thinks, is to expose more women to the sector at young age: “Just educate more people about it.” Other remedies proposed for addressing the energy industry’s gender imbalance include better transparency on promotions inside companies, and much closer scrutiny of hiring practices. “Everyone should have to monitor the [gender] figures, the intake and promotion figures into middle management, and from middle management into board,” says MacNaughton. “When you get the transparency, then people start to see the problem and fix it. There will never be a single bullet for such a complex problem.” The Drax dilemma Dorothy Thompson’s 12-year reign at Drax has seen her dramatically transform what it does and where it’s going. She foresaw the end of coal in the UK long before ministers announced in 2015 their plan to phase out all coal power by 2025. Three of Drax’s coal-fired generators have been converted to burn wood pellets, mostly from North American forests. But the company suffered a setback in 2014 when the government ruled that a fourth unit would not be eligible for subsidies, and another in 2015, when the Treasury ended its carbon tax exemption. Drax is lobbying for a rethink, arguing that the UK needs stable low-carbon power to complement increasing amounts of wind and solar energy, but the prospect of a further subsidy is unlikely. The company signalled a new strategy last year with its acquisition of business energy supplier Opus Energy and four gas power stations, and is also looking to buy more wood pellet plants in the US. “It’s all about diversifying our earnings, strengthening their stability, and using our areas of expertise and our commercial position to make us stronger and more sustainable - in every sense of the word,” Thompson told the Observer. But some analysts are sceptical of how profitable this will be. “Drax’s acquisition of Opus Energy heralded the start of a new strategy focusing on securing earnings beyond 2027,” investment bank Jefferies said in a recent note. “We feel optimism regarding the new strategy is overdone and we continue to believe that long-term power prices will remain low.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/13/why-rich-think-development-one-way-uk-gender-energy-sustainable-goals","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-13T14:41:34Z","webTitle":"Why do rich countries think development should be only one way?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/13/why-rich-think-development-one-way-uk-gender-energy-sustainable-goals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/13/why-rich-think-development-one-way-uk-gender-energy-sustainable-goals","fields":{"headline":"Why do rich countries think development should be only one way?","bodyText":"In my 20 or so years working with the development sector I’ve long been extremely uncomfortable with the idea that we in the “north” know better than those in the “south”. We certainly have more material resources, and so more power and opportunities than many, but development as something rich people do to poor people doesn’t gel well with me. Nowadays, many people working in development would agree with this view. And yet we still send our workers to developing countries to “build capacity”; we send young volunteers there to help out in their gap year; and we constantly lecture poorer countries about the vagaries of everything from corruption to inequality. Ahem … glass houses? So I’ve concluded that the next generation of “development” should turn this equation on its head. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) were lauded, in part, because they were universal: yes, Sierra Leone or Vietnam has to adopt them but so, too, does the UK. We may be able to offer financial resources to the south, but the south has a considerable store of knowledge to offer us, too. “Reverse development” is what we need, and we should set up a northern based agency staffed by southerners to help build our own capacity to meet the SDGs. Some examples come to mind. Gender equality (goal five) Nicaragua, Rwanda and Ecuador all rank higher than the UK in the World Economic Forum’s global gender gap. Fewer than a third of our MPs are women, ranking us 49th in the world in terms of the number of women in national parliaments. Many developing countries are doing far better. What can we learn from them? How did they achieve it? What systems do we need to put in place? Affordable and clean energy (goal seven) Micro grid and off grid, affordable solar energy is taking off in the developing world. Rather than waiting for mega projects many, such as Mera Gao Power in Uttar Pradesh, India, or Karibu solar in Tanzania, are showing how it’s done. Where are our energy social entrepreneurs? We have a swath of community energy projects, but large Hinkley-style money pits still dominate our energy landscape. Can we learn from the southern social entrepreneurs and just get on with it? Can they build our capacity to innovate? Sustainable consumption (goal 12) Several development economists, from Amartya Sen to Manfred Max Neef, have looked at the role of wellbeing and poverty, and considered wellbeing to be the ultimate aim, rather than macro-level economic growth, jobs, or even income. People in developing countries can help us gain a much better understanding of how to live the good life, while consuming less. Clearly, the poor don’t have enough material needs or security to have high levels of wellbeing. But having a higher income and consuming more isn’t necessarily a recipe to success either. Rather than exporting our overladen consumer culture to the south, we should be learning from and listening to those whose lives are reported as having high levels of satisfaction, yet who consume fewer material resources. Peace, justice and strong institutions (goal 16) Western criminal justice systems are almost entirely based on punishment for bad behaviour. In many African countries, and indigenous communities through the world, customary law focuses more on reconciliation and social responsibility. Especially for low-risk offenders, it has been shown to be more effective in reducing repeat offences. Rather than building more prisons, can we bring expertise from these communities to help us build the skills and capacity we need to introduce successful restorative justice programmes here at home? Partnerships for sustainable development (goal 17) If Brexit and the rise of Trump tell us anything, it’s that people feel disenfranchised and want more, rather than less, control over decisions that affect them directly. Brazil provides one of the best case studies, where dozens of communities are engaged in democratic processes over local public investment priorities, under the guise of “participatory budgeting”. Research from Brazil shows that this leads to increases in public spending on social programmes, from health and education to water and sanitation. In India, similar results were found across communities in the southern state of Kerala, where participatory budgeting led to significant improvements in roads, housing and child services. Why aren’t we doing more of this in the developed world? Other examples come to mind – the digital economy is adapting far more rapidly in some parts of the south, such as India, than in the north. Care of older people, meanwhile, also has elements we need to adopt more of in the north, such as how to look after extended families in the home. Development is no longer a one-way street. “Reverse development” may be as important for the next 60 years, as north-south development has been for the past 60.

Experts speaking at the Australian Solar Energy Exhibition and Conference in Melbourne last week said the technology had been proven in other countries, and projects in Australia were viable, but the challenge was getting major investors to gamble on something new. James Fisher, the chief technology officer of Australian solar energy company Vast Solar, said solar thermal energy had been the “poor cousin” to photovoltaic solar panels for some years, but that may finally be changing. “We’ve got a whole lot of coal-fired power stations that largely are 30-plus years old and many of them are going to retire naturally,” he said. “[Concentrated solar power] CSP is basically a complete coal-fired power replacement. “We can act as base-load [power], we can run 24/7 if that is what is needed and we have all the benefits that a coal plant offers to the grid.” The theory behind large-scale solar thermal is relatively simple, even if building it is not. Curved mirrors called heliostats are positioned in a field, reflecting the sun’s energy onto a tower with a receiver on top. A liquid material, such as molten salt, is pumped through the receiver where it is heated and then pumped back down to be stored in a tank. When electricity is required, the hot material is used to heat water, creating steam and turning a turbine. Vast Solar has a solar thermal plant in Jemalong, near Forbes, 370km west of Sydney and will complete a 6MW pilot plant at nearby Jemalong within the next few months. It will then move forward with a 30MW plant on the site, which would be a commercial-scale plant and, hopefully, a proving ground for Vast Solar’s technology. “Obviously you want to build big and in the CSP industry you get a lot of bang for your buck as you increase the size of your turbine,” Mr Fisher said. “Ideally, you’d be building at that 250MW scale, but we can go down as little as 30MW and make it work [commercially].” Vast Solar’s Jemalong project uses several 27-metre towers, each with a receiver in front of hundreds of heliostats. Every model is different and Vast Solar pumps liquid sodium into its receivers, where it is heated to about 600C, before it is pumped back down and the heat transferred to molten salt for storage. The company has raised $25m for the project so far, enough to proceed with the 30MW station. Another, much bigger solar thermal project in the spotlight was a proposed 110MW plant to be built at Port Augusta in South Australia by US renewable energy company SolarReserve. SolarReserve already has runs on the board, after completing an operational 110MW plant in Nevada in the United States last year. Daniel Thompson, the director of development, said that success in Nevada, along with projects under way in other countries, could be replicated in Port Augusta. “This is very much a blueprint from our previous projects, so it is largely de-risked and we’re very, very comfortable with what we can deliver there,” he said. That confidence is obviously shared by the world’s biggest coal producer, Chinese company Shenhua Coal, which signed a memorandum of understanding with SolarReserve last week to build ten, large-scale solar tower and storage plants in China, totalling more than 1,000MW and at a cost of $2bn. The proposed plant in Port Augusta, to be called Aurora, would be located 30km north of town. Unlike the Vast Solar Project, SolarReserve’s plan uses one large tower with a receiver at the top, surrounded by thousands of heliostats. Like all large-scale solar thermal plants, Aurora’s true value lies in its energy storage – 880MW hours, enough to last about eight hours, so that it can keep generating electricity at night, when solar panels have stopped producing. SolarReserve uses molten salt through the entire process, pumping it through the receiver and into the storage tanks at about 565C. Mr Thompson said construction of the plant in Nevada had created 4,500 jobs in the construction phase, and 45 permanent jobs once the plant was operational. Those numbers will be similar at the Port Augusta plant. He said investors were enthusiastic about the project in Port Augusta, but they needed to see certain fundamentals fall into place before committing. “We have already been to the debt and equity markets and had an overwhelming response from them and we are oversubscribed on both, which is great,” he said. “It’s early stages and they’ve obviously got to look at the project more deeply to finalise their position on that, but early indications are there is plenty of money around for this technology.” While SolarReserve and Vast Solar were both bullish about the future of their Australian projects, neither shied away from the reality that investors still have a ‘wait and see’ approach to large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia. “Right now, when it’s a first-off plant, [attracting investors] is a difficult thing, so you need an investor with a high-risk appetite,” James Fisher said. “That really means it’s going to need government support. “Once you’ve got the first plant built, then it comes to a different sort of [investor] and there is huge amounts of money out there looking for infrastructure investments that are giving a return over a 30-year plant life. “There is no shortage of funds once you prove the technology,” he said."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"science/political-science/2016/jul/23/after-brexit-breaking-down-barriers-in-science-is-more-necessary-than-ever","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-23T08:00:35Z","webTitle":"After Brexit, breaking down barriers in science is more necessary than ever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/jul/23/after-brexit-breaking-down-barriers-in-science-is-more-necessary-than-ever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2016/jul/23/after-brexit-breaking-down-barriers-in-science-is-more-necessary-than-ever","fields":{"headline":"After Brexit, breaking down barriers in science is more necessary than ever","bodyText":"Next week, the European science community will meet at the biannual EuroScience Open Forum (ESOF) in Manchester. This will be the first ESOF to be held in the UK, and the first in the context of a post-referendum Britain. With the uncertainty that Brexit has created both in Britain and Europe more generally, and for UK science in particular, there has never been a more important time for the European science community to commit to overcoming barriers. Few in the world of science would quibble over the assertion that British science has benefited enormously from EU membership and vice versa. European initiatives have helped create working relationships that transcend boundaries whilst the UK science base has benefited tremendously from the free movement of scientists and innovators across national and organisational boundaries. More generally, recent European history is defined by the breaking down of barriers, not least the knocking down of a wall that, for decades, divided a nation. At midnight on 9 November 1989, concrete and steel shattered and bent as segments of the Berlin Wall parted. This opened access to both sides of the city for the first time in nearly 30 years. The fall of the wall was the first step for Germany, towards reunification and new frontiers and boundaries on social, economic, architectural, and infrastructural levels. Cut to almost twenty years later, and Europe is a changed place with a vibrant science base that has been fostered through collaboration and cross-working on a number of levels, which includes the role carried out by forums such as the Falling Walls Lab, which works to promote international collaboration and cross-disciplinary exchange. Our annual event encourages under-graduate and post-graduate innovators from all disciplines to present to us their ideas on which is the next wall to fall, and how they propose to help it fall. Previous entries having included breaking the ‘walls’ of gross income inequality to producing cleaner solar energy, and from combatting cardiovascular disease to introducing living robots. As a world-wide event with national heats, and through encouraging entries from all academic disciplines, our work provides a platform for ideas that transcends boundaries, breaking down a barrier in itself. We are conscious, however, that there is still a long way to go in truly overcoming the barriers to cross-boundary working. This covers a wide range of issues including funding availability and access, a lack of awareness of the benefits this type of working can bring, resourcing facilitators, and general logistics. Taking into account recent political developments, a focus on building and maintaining bridges to keep the scientific community of Europe and the world connected and active has never been more important. That’s why we’re committed to supporting the sector in the UK by providing a platform for scientists to connect within Europe and the rest of the world. What’s certain is that, in order to break down the barriers that still exist and ensure that new ones aren’t created or re-built, it will be essential to continue to promote an open dialogue within the European scientific community. What we have at our disposal are some of the greatest minds from across the world with a vested interest in making sure that this happens. Naveed Syed is Project Manager for Falling Walls Lab.

The snowy surface of Greenland started becoming significantly less reflective of solar radiation from around 1996, the analysis found, with the ice absorbing 2% more solar energy per decade from this point. At the same time, summer near-surface temperatures in Greenland have increased at a rate of around 0.74C per decade, causing the ice to melt. This winnowing away of the ice, exacerbated by soot blown on to the ice from wildfires, means that Greenland’s ice is stuck in what is known as a “feedback loop” that will make it ever more vulnerable to warming global temperatures. The study predicts that the ice surface reflectivity, or albedo, will drop by 10% or more by the end of the century, which will trigger further melting. “It’s melting cannibalism, basically – it’s melting that’s feeding itself,” said lead author Marco Tedesco, of Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. “Rising temperatures are promoting more melting, and that melting is reducing albedo, which in turn is increasing melting. “It’s worrying because if the ice sheet continues to get darker, it becomes more sensitive to atmospheric warming. The impact of two weeks of sunshine with no clouds, for example, is far greater than it was 20 years ago. The ice is going to melt much more quickly, with more water flowing off on to the sea.” In recent years, scientists have began to pick apart the complex, interrelated forces at play in the Arctic, which has experienced a 13.4% drop in minimum ice extent per decade, on average, since the 1980s. More than half of the Greenland ice sheet experienced some melting last summer, the largest annual melt since 2012 and well beyond the average melting seen over the past 35 years. Tedesco’s research shows that as the surface of Greenland’s ice melts, old impurities, such as dust from erosion or soot that has been entombed for years, start to appear, darkening the surface. If the summer is warm enough to remove all the snow, these dark impurities begin to spread across the surface, providing a far more heat-absorbent environment. At the same time, as this snow melts and then refreezes, the grains of snow get larger. These larger grains, invisible to the eye but detected by satellite’s infrared instruments, also create a less reflective surface. These two processes are turning Greenland into a store, rather than a reflector, of solar energy, with consequences far beyond the icy wilderness. Water from the melting flows into the sea, contributing to rising oceans around the world. This process is unlikely to reverse given the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. “As warming continues, the feedback from declining albedo will add up,” Tedesco said. “It’s a train running downhill, and the hill is getting steeper.” The research, published in the European Geosciences Union journal The Cryosphere, looked at satellite data from 1981 to 2012. The drop in reflectivity from 1996 was probably due to a change in atmospheric circulation that favoured warmer, moist air from the south. The scientists found there was no significant increase in soot from forest fires since 1997 to explain the darkening of the surface. This article was amended on 3 March 2016. An earlier version referred to the European Geophysical Union, instead of the European Geosciences Union. This article was amended on 4 March 2016 to clarify a statement that more than half of the Greenland ice sheet melted away last year. More than 50% of the ice sheet experienced some melting, but didn’t melt away completely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/sep/10/solar-energy-cells-you-can-print-out-catching-commercial-eye-says-csiro","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-10T06:39:41Z","webTitle":"Solar energy cells you can print out catching commercial eye, says CSIRO","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/solar-energy-cells-you-can-print-out-catching-commercial-eye-says-csiro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/10/solar-energy-cells-you-can-print-out-catching-commercial-eye-says-csiro","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy cells you can print out catching commercial eye, says CSIRO","bodyText":"Renewable energy generation that allows flexible solar power cells to be printed off and attached to places such as windows and smartphones is close to commercialisation, the CSIRO has said. Work on printed solar cells has been under way since 2007 through the Victorian Organic Solar Cell Consortium, which includes CSIRO, and Melbourne and Monash universities. A printer at the CSIRO office in Clayton, Victoria, has been able to make prototypes of the solar cells in order to improve their efficiency. The technology consists of a type of “solar ink” which is designed to capture sunlight and turn it into electricity. A fine layer of this ink is then deposited onto a material, such as plastic. This allows for cells to be embedded into windows, effectively tinting them, to generate electricity. They can be printed in smaller sizes to be used to charge devices such as smartphones and laptops. The CSIRO has had the solar cells on its Clayton roof for the past 18 months, with decent results. The printed cells are 10 times less efficient than standard solar panels, which are made of silicon, but scientists hope to improve that. Fiona Scholes, the group leader of integrated systems and devices at CSIRO’s manufacturing flagship, said several companies, such as Dyesol, had expressed interest in helping commercialise the technology. “We can’t manufacture them here, but we are at the point where they can be taken up by a manufacturer,” she told Guardian Australia. “It would be wonderful if we could achieve a similar power delivery at significantly reduced cost. Silicon is falling in price, but think about how cheap plastic is. The ink is a negligible cost, so the raw materials are very cost effective. “This is a big step forward because you can put these cells anywhere you can think of. Also the consistency is better than silicon – they work well in cloudy conditions.” Funding for the project has been provided by the Victorian government and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena). The federal government is attempting to abolish Arena. “Whenever I tell people about this technology, the response is so positive,” said Scholes. “People love the idea. I think there would be a good demand for it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2016/nov/06/katharine-hayhoe-climate-scientist-evangelical-christian","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-06T13:00:16Z","webTitle":"Texas scientist and evangelical takes to the web to convert climate cynics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/06/katharine-hayhoe-climate-scientist-evangelical-christian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2016/nov/06/katharine-hayhoe-climate-scientist-evangelical-christian","fields":{"headline":"Texas scientist and evangelical takes to the web to convert climate cynics","bodyText":"“Speaking of shills, if she teaches in Texas she probably gets grants from the oil industry.” This is one of the more polite social media missiles Katharine Hayhoe has had fired at her this week. But it’s hopelessly misguided. Hayhoe is a climate scientist. And she’s on a mission to persuade skeptics that humans are frying the planet and time is running out to stop it. The last people she would take money from is Big Oil. While most US climate scientists live amid constant controversy, Hayhoe believes she is enduring an acute level of abuse because she reaches parts of the population many of her peers cannot reach. She’s an evangelical Christian. Her husband is an evangelical pastor, even, in a faith whose followers are largely skeptical of climate science. But stating the obvious doesn’t stop the hate mail. It’s stepped up a notch since the academic launched a new web series in recent weeks, Global Weirding – a twist on the term global warming – to explain to doubters why climate change is causing ever more peculiar, dangerous weather and it’s our fault. “Oh, I’ve been called the C-word, I’ve been called an ‘eff-wit’, some really disgusting stuff. Most of it is just hateful, hateful language, a lot of it anonymous – and when it’s not nameless, 99% of the time it’s from a white man. Facebook and Twitter’s systems for reporting abuse are garbage, by the way,” she said. Hayhoe is the director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, where she teaches and conducts research as an atmospheric scientist and an associate professor of political science. As a Texas-dwelling, evangelical Christian, atmospheric scientist, Hayhoe can often win the ears of many religious communities, receive invitations to address students at Christian colleges, or have conversations with mega-church-going Republican climate cynics she otherwise mightn’t meet or who wouldn’t listen. Her faith and, now, her web series, has led many people to tell her they had believed or suspected that human-influenced climate change was a liberal hoax but that she has changed their minds, she said. But Global Weirding has also brought increased hate mail. “I did have, a few years ago, a death threat, which I reported to the police,” she said. Now new floods of insults are pouring in since she launched the web series last month. She’s coping partly by seeing it as a “sort of encouraging, in a strange way” sign that she’s hitting new audiences, drawing contrarians and environmental converts alike. Hayhoe has made Global Weirding in conjunction with her local PBS TV station, KTTZ, and it’s released via YouTube. The short installments are released every other Wednesday, with the fourth one of the inaugural season due the day after the 8 November presidential election. The series delivers a carefully calibrated, humorous, light-hearted lecture underpinned with serious science, featuring cartoons and Hayhoe talking on screen. The first episode sought to “bust the myth” of stereotypical “green liberals” having a monopoly on environmentalism. The second explained the history of climate science and why global warming isn’t a blip, a natural cycle or a leftwing conspiracy. And the third pointed out that while Texas emits more carbon than Germany, it’s also the US’s leading producer of wind energy and “has the potential to lead the nation in solar energy”. Forthcoming episodes explore themes such as “it’s not just polar bears”, “what happened in Paris?” and “religion in relation to climate change”. Evangelical Christians in the US are split on whether climate change is real and whether it’s mankind’s fault. The National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) supports the science but that body only represents a portion of the born-again faithful in America. “We have to draw a very clear line between US evangelicals and those in the rest of the world,” said Hayhoe. “I went to the Paris climate talks last December and the head of the World Evangelical Alliance, Efraim Tendero, was an official delegate. It doesn’t get more serious than that,” she said, referring to the talks that led to a historic deal in which, after years of conflict, almost 200 countries, including the US, signed an agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions. That deal came into force on Friday after the US, China and the European Union agreed to ratify it in recent weeks. “In the US, the NAE supports the science but evangelicals are not a coherent denomination here. It’s extremely fragmented, there are no bishops or hierarchy, most churches have one overworked pastor and there’s a leadership vacuum on climate that’s being filled by conservative politicians and media,” Hayhoe said. She added that while evangelicals in other countries typically believe humans are changing the climate, only about 30 or 40% of US evangelicals agree. However, she said the skepticism is more linked to conservatism than religion per se. When Hayhoe encounters those insisting that what happens in the world is controlled by God, she explains the climate science – but can also reference the Bible. She quotes the book of Genesis to illustrate that “God gave us the planet and says we are responsible for it” and then Revelation, warning: “God will destroy those who destroy the Earth.” Hayhoe is Canadian, so won’t be voting on Tuesday. But she’s dismayed that “the US is the only country in the entire world where one major political party [the GOP] explicitly denies the reality of climate change,” she said. Based on what the rivals for the White House have said on the campaign trail, if Hillary Clinton wins on Tuesday Hayhoe will be “cautiously hopeful” about action to slow global warming. How will she feel if Donald Trump wins? “Alarmed,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/nov/04/florida-solar-power-amendment-1-vote-al-gore-criticism","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-04T19:27:03Z","webTitle":"Florida measure calls itself pro-solar but critics say it's 'a wolf in sheep's clothing'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/04/florida-solar-power-amendment-1-vote-al-gore-criticism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/nov/04/florida-solar-power-amendment-1-vote-al-gore-criticism","fields":{"headline":"Florida measure calls itself pro-solar but critics say it's 'a wolf in sheep's clothing'","bodyText":"Climate change may have been largely ignored during the presidential election but it will be on the ballot on 8 November, with Florida voters deciding on a measure backed by large utilities that could effectively snuff out the solar industry in the state. The measure, known as amendment 1, has been criticized as “fundamentally dishonest” for superficially appearing to be pro-solar. However, renewable energy experts warn that it would remove the incentive for homeowners to get rooftop solar panels, devastating the solar industry in America’s sunshine state. The amendment would change Florida’s constitution to give consumers the right to have solar panels installed. But it also states that the government should “ensure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do”. A group called Consumers for Smart Solar, backed by more than $20m in campaign funding by Florida’s large energy utilities, has put forward the measure, ostensibly to protect Florida residents from rip-offs. But critics contend that the proposal would lead the way to solar panel owners facing fees or a reduced price for the excess energy they put back into the grid, known as net metering. “The utilities have been fundamentally dishonest, their behavior is incredibly cynical,” said David Pomerantz, executive director of pro-renewables group Energy and Policy Institute. “It has confused quite a few voters and that was by design. The large electric utilities in Florida feel extraordinarily threatened by customer-owned solar. Instead of trying to adapt to it, they want to kill rooftop solar in the cradle.” Pomerantz said the measure would be a major blow to a solar industry that is already “stunted” in Florida. Fewer than 20,000 Floridian homes have solar panels, despite its enormous potential for solar energy, compared with Massachusetts, a north-east state with a quarter of the population, which has 163,000 homes with solar panels. The dismantling of net metering, one of the few incentives to get solar in Florida, could have a similar outcome as that seen in Nevada, where increased charges and reduced net metering credits saw leading solar panel installer SolarCity pull out of the state. Environmentalists have rounded on the Florida measure, with former vice-president Al Gore accusing the utilities of “trying to fool you” into killing off the solar industry. A court challenge to stop the measure was defeated in the Florida supreme court but Justice Barbara Pariente, in dissent, called the amendment a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” and an attempt to “constitutionalize the status quo”. Polling has shown strong support for amendment 1, although support has recently plummeted to close to the 60% threshold needed for the proposition to pass. The drop in support followed the Miami Herald’s release in October of an audio recording by Sal Nuzzo, vice-president of free market group James Madison Institute. Nuzzo told an industry conference that amendment 1 was an “incredibly savvy maneuver” and “political jiujitsu” that would “completely negate anything (pro-solar groups) would try to do legislatively or constitutionally down the road”. Consumers for Smart Solar, the utilities-backed group, has denied any connection to the Hames Madison Institute and insisted that the amendment would protect consumers from scams and from subsidizing solar companies from outside Florida. “Amendment 1 is good for the environment, it is good for consumers and it is good for Florida,” said Dick Batchelor, co-chair of Consumers for Smart Solar. “However, in looking at ways to increase the amount of our energy that comes from the sun, it is essential that we do so in a way that safeguards consumers – particularly our seniors – with commonsense consumer protection rules that benefit every consumer, and that we have all come to expect.” The Florida solar measure isn’t the only climate-related item voters will decide on on Tuesday. Voters in Washington will decide whether the state will be the first in the US to introduce a carbon tax on emissions. The measure, called I-732, would place a $25-per-ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions from 2018, rising gradually over the course of 40 years to $100. It will aim to be revenue neutral, however, because Washington’s sales tax will be cut by 1% and further tax rebated will be given to manufacturers and low-income households. The vote has split environment groups, some of which supported an alternative that would have raised money to be funneled into clean energy projects. The Sierra Club has said it doesn’t support I-732 because it “does not include all that is needed for an equitable climate policy and just transition to a clean energy economy”, in particular by failing to support communities of color and low income. The projections put forward by Carbon Washington, the grassroots group behind the measure, have also been questioned. An analysis by the Washington Office of Financial Management found that the measure will cut the state’s revenue by $200m a year. However, the measure does retain some notable support, including former Nasa scientist James Hansen, actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Steven Chu, former secretary of energy under Barack Obama. An open letter penned by 51 climate scientists also backs I-732. “This revenue neutral measure offers the most progressive change in our tax code in decades and represents a bipartisan effort that rejects ideology,” the letter states. “While many interrelated social and environmental needs demand our attention, complex problems are best solved one step at a time. I-732 is a simple step in the right direction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/sustainable-solar-power-innovation-off-the-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-21T12:16:00Z","webTitle":"Solar energy technology for those with no access to electricity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-solar-power-innovation-off-the-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-solar-power-innovation-off-the-grid","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy technology for those with no access to electricity","bodyText":"Around the world approximately 1.7 billion people still live off the grid, with no access to mains electricity. This comes with numerous problems, with lighting and access to income among the most pressing. Once the sun goes does down those off the grid are reliant on kerosene, which is not only hazardous but expensive. While mobile phone use is widespread off the grid, recharging can be a difficult process requiring a long journey, and the lack of charge can mean restricted access to business opportunities or basic services. Solar power could have a major role in solving these problems and others, with a number of new products aimed at improving conditions and opportunities for those in off the grid, base of the pyramid markets. Some are being directly marketed to developing nations, while some have applications with the potential to make a difference worldwide. A number of these companies owe their success to crowdfunding campaigns, highlighting the role that the general public have to play in ensuring that such projects, with sustainability applications for both developing and developed nations, get further than the planning stages. Here are five examples of solar power innovations aiming to make a difference to those living off the grid. Waka Waka The Waka Waka solar light is the brainchild of Dutch product developer, Camille van Gestel. A successful crowdfunding campaign in 2012 saw the Waka Waka light go into mass-production, with 75,000 having been shipped around the world to date. The product itself provides 80 hours of light after one day of charge, offering an alternative to the kerosine lamp. A second Kickstarter campaign allowed the Waka Waka Power to go into production, combing the original light with a solar battery charger. The company ran a 'buy one give one' campaign, in which every sale saw a unit sent to Haiti, reaching an estimated 50,000 people. Fenix ReadySet Founded in 2009, Fenix International is a venture-backed renewable energy company. Another crowdfunding success, its ReadySet solar-powered battery charger aim to reach those off the grid, providing not only a means to energy, but the potential for employment and income too, such as a recharging shop in Uganda. The company is currently patenting a mobile payment system to allow further ease of access to their product. BuffaloGrid BuffaloGrid was founded with the hope to bring power to people, and to allow those in remote, off the grid areas to capitalise on opportunities. Pioneered in Uganda, where 80% of the population has mobile phones but only 5% has access to mains electricity, the system offers customers access to a portable grid. This grid tops up the phone charger when a SMS message is sent, allowing a phone to be charged. This means that vital revenue streams and business opportunities are not lost via traveling long distances to recharge. Econet Solar Home Station Econet Wireless is designed for people with limited access to power grids. Connecting a solar panel to a battery, the Home Station has four USB oulets for charging phones, computers and light sources. The system is currently in use in an estimated 2,000 homes in Zimbabwe. The device is available for a small deposit, making it accessible to those with low income, and is run via a connection to a mobile network. Spor Succesfully funded via a Kickstarter campaign, the Spor solar charger is a portable solar battery, currently available for pre-order. Each individual unit has the capacity of over three standard phone chargers, and the units can be interlinked to create more power. While initial development was geared for the US market, it's portability and ease of use could see it become a useful tool for those off the grid.

Large-scale solar will triple in size, with Arena today announcing the 12 winners of its $92m in grants, which together leverage more than $1bn investment from private companies. The purpose of the grants was to establish a self-sustaining industry of large solar farms, by building competitiveness, bringing down costs and establishing a supply chain for the industry. It appeared to be successful in doing that since, throughout the series of grants, the amount of grant funding needed for each project dropped from $1.60 per MW in 2014 to just 19c today. As a result, projects in the new funding round required only 10% of their cost covered by grants to get off the ground, compared with about half of the cost three years ago. That meant the $92m spent by Arena in this round will be attracting almost $1bn in private investment. “Today’s announcement is a very big deal,” Arena’s chief executive, Ivor Frischknecht, said at an announcement in Sydney. “We have some of the best solar resources in the world, and we lead the world in terms of rooftop solar, but we have been lagging in terms of large-scale solar deployment. That’s about to change over the next 12 months.” When complete, the solar farms will triple the amount of large-scale solar in Australia – from the current 240MW to 720MW – powering 150,000 average Australian homes and fulfilling 10% of the renewable energy target for 2020. The biggest winner of the new grants was Queensland, where six projects would deliver 300.1MW. That will be done with $51.4m from Arena and $637.4m in total investment. Queensland’s minister for energy, Mark Bailey, said at the announcement: “For Queensland, today is a momentous day. We are seeing a new industry start. “It means more than 500 regional jobs, with hundreds of indirect jobs consequently as well, which is fantastic news for communities for instance around Whitsunday and Collinsville, areas that have struggled as the mining industry has gone through a transitional phase.” Arena gave funding to five projects in New South Wales, with a total capacity of 162.3MW and the remaining 20MW project in Western Australia. The chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, Kane Thornton, said: “The holy grail, I think it’s fair to say, is now within reach. And that is the ability to produce electricity from the sun cheaper than any other form of new electricity generation.” Last week, the Turnbull government entered its “omnibus” savings bill to parliament, which seeks to pass all the cuts that Labor agreed to before the election. That includes a $1bn cut to Arena, removing the future capacity of the agency to make grants, potentially making today’s announcement the last round of grants from the agency. Jack Curtis, the Asia-Pacific regional manager at the world’s biggest solar company, FirstSolar, said: “I find it particularly mystifying and disappointing that the government with a stated commitment to innovation and new industry creation would seek to constrain one of its own agencies that has been so effective at contributing to both of these goals.” Thornton said: “These types of extraordinary developments we’ve heard today would essentially be kneecapped. And we think that would be a tragedy for this country.” Solar Citizens, a group that represents and campaigns for solar energy in Australia, analysed which federal seats each of the projects fell into and found all but one were in Coalition-held seats, except for one, which was in Bob Katter’s seat of Kennedy. The national director of Solar Citizens, Claire O’Rourke, told Guardian Australia: “It’s a strong reminder for Coalition MPs, who are tied to efforts to destroy Arena’s future, that Arena projects are helping to fuel regional communities across Australia. “To put it simply – it’s stupid. Stupid politics, stupid economics and stupid policy.” Despite not opposing the measure before the election, Labor has left open the possibility of opposing the cut, which would mean voting against the entire omnibus bill. The Greens’ energy and climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, today urged Labor to block the cuts. “Bill Shorten, don’t kill renewable energy innovation. Don’t kill Arena,” Bandt said. “Bill Shorten needs to listen to energy companies, the CSIRO, university solar researchers and the Australian people who all say Arena’s funding should continue. “Australia could be a renewable energy superpower, yet we have a government intent on sending us back to the dark ages by cutting clean energy while simultaneously handing out billions to the fossil fuel industry and an opposition who may wave through these cuts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jul/27/green-cuts-renewable-energy-risk-uk-dark-ages","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-27T11:12:20Z","webTitle":"Green cuts risk sending UK back to the dark ages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/27/green-cuts-renewable-energy-risk-uk-dark-ages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jul/27/green-cuts-renewable-energy-risk-uk-dark-ages","fields":{"headline":"Green cuts risk sending UK back to the dark ages","bodyText":"The government’s U-turn on renewable energy risks sending this country back to the dark ages of relying only on fossil fuel. Since the election we have seen a slashing of subsidies for biomass, anaerobic digestion and biogas as well as solar and wind. This will make very little difference to household bills but will impact heavily on energy security and in the long-term increase bills with no way back. Renewable energy can actually secure energy prices, giving security for households, whatever fossil fuel prices are. The sudden abolition of these subsidies was, wind power aside, a massive surprise. For a business-friendly government, it is a risky message to send and one that could shake investor confidence. What I don’t understand is why the government would apply the climate change levy on renewable energy plants which are carbon-positive. It’s illogical. Even worse, it removes the business case for existing renewable energy plants that were predicated on the investment avoiding carbon tax until 2023. Without financial justification, it will be very hard for business to invest in renewables again – particularly if there is a worry that any other support could be scrapped at a moment’s notice. Worse still, the government’s logic behind the U-turn is flawed. Working with Imperial College London, we researched the potential of a ‘circular’ economy, an economy which gets full value from natural resources. The research forecast that this economy would be worth an extra £29bn to the UK and would create 175,000 jobs. Rather than stifling the potential of a circular economy, the government needs to encourage it. Instead of removing subsidies, it should expanding them and finding other, creative ways to boost sustainability. In December, the government will be taking part in the UN climate summit in Paris. A global event, incorporating governments and business, it could be a generation-defining event and enable a climate secure future. Paris will perhaps be the last chance to deliver climate security. Of course, energy will be a major pillar of these discussions. Do we really want to be the country stepping back in time? The government needs to accept its environmental and energy responsibilities and bring back subsidies for renewable energy. By doing so, it will help secure this country’s energy future. It will also set the right tone heading into Paris, where we should be a significant force in ensuring global climate security."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/14/afghanistan-solar-power-new-zealand-aid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-14T14:41:00Z","webTitle":"After the Taliban: taking solar energy to remote parts of Afghanistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/14/afghanistan-solar-power-new-zealand-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/14/afghanistan-solar-power-new-zealand-aid","fields":{"headline":"After the Taliban: taking solar energy to remote parts of Afghanistan","bodyText":"Carved into the cliffs behind Bamiyan town centre in Afghanistan's central highlands, massive holes scar the homeland of the Hazara people, a Shia minority who live between the Hindu Kush and Koh-i-Baba mountain ranges. The hollows once housed statues of Buddha, until the Taliban infamously set dynamite to them in 2001. But within a few kilometres of these monuments to tyranny stand symbols of renewal – rows of solar panels bringing stable electricity to the homes of local people for the first time – and with them the chance of improving their lives. The United Nations Development Programme identified the lack of stable, affordable power as the largest obstacle to development in Bamiyan Province, but it is one of many. The Taliban destroyed most of the region's few schools. There is now just one sealed road and droughts are common. The deprivation \"is hard to put into words,\" says Besmellah Jahed, the director of the Rehabilitation and Social Development Organisation, a local NGO. \"They've had 30 years of disappointment, 30 years of failed hope and promises. Hospitals, roads and airports - everything you need for a community to develop, they've been waiting for it to arrive,\" says Tony Woods, a New Zealand entrepreneur whose company Sustainable Energy Services International (Sesi) built the solar power system. Before the solar installation started operating in December, locals had to rely on an expensive, haphazard system of neighbourhood generators, kerosene lamps and tiny, private solar panels to access even the most rudimentary power supply. The Taliban massacres and destruction of the Buddhas ensured the province remains deeply antagonistic toward the counter-insurgency, making it a relatively stable oasis in the fractious countryside. This security has created an environment that encourages investment in infrastructure. Sesi says the 1MW facility is central Asia's largest off-grid solar plant. It powers 2500 homes around the provincial capital, Bamiyan. During the winter months the cells are backed up for a few hours each night by a diesel generator. The New Zealand government, whose army administered the region during the western occupation, backed the installation with a US$14.1m grant. Building in a province surrounded on all sides by war and mountains, with no existing power infrastructure, was a huge logistical challenge, says Woods. Every pole, wire, panel and frame had to be imported. His team of local and foreign workers had to contest with corrupt customs officials, a supply road that sporadically fell under the control of insurgents, the closure of the Pakistani border for eight months and winters so cold their concrete would not set. The project also had to overcome local scepticism bred by bitter experiences. \"They wanted to know if we were going to steal all the money [from their power bills] and take it back to New Zealand,\" says Woods. There was also concern that electricity rates would be too high, despite the fact that residents were paying some of the highest prices in the world. Overcoming scepticism was a case of build it and they will come, says Woods. \"When this project was started, people were doubtful about how much electricity would cost,\" agrees Khalil Rahman Anwari an employee of the Agency for Assistance and Development of Afghanistan. \"After the project started, the demand increased.\" Locals still think prices are too high, pointing out that electricity in Kabul is significantly cheaper. Most people can only run a few appliances. But Anwari says the access to reliable, affordable light makes possible the most simple but important of activities, like homework during the dark winter months. The Afghan government now owns and administers Bamiyan's power supply. Local technicians, including many women, have been trained to operate it. The system uses pre-paid credit, which users buy from banks. This avoids the risk of meter readers being tempted to offer favours to neighbours in the tight-knit community. The accountancy of the project is transparent and can be audited by Sesi and the New Zealand government remotely. Woods says it was important to create a system large enough to become self-sufficient and fund its own growth. But New Zealand's aid commitments to Bamiyan have now been scaled back and only around 5% of the estimated 418,000 people in Bamiyan Province currently receive the project's electricity. Jahed, who was born in Bamiyan, says growth into other parts of the province is imperative. People have already started crowding into the areas supplied by power. The provincial government had promised those who lack power would be supplied by generators, but this has not happened. \"Bamiyan people are very kind and appreciate any minor development,\" he says. \"But this is not sufficient. We suggest the extension of this project.\" Read more stories like this: • Chile's solar market is leading the way in South America • Could renewable energy make rural electrification a reality? • Quiz: what do you know about renewable energy?

The World Energy Council blamed the government’s lack of clarity and myriad changes which it said have left the country facing a potential gap in energy supply. The UK has previously been one of the top performers in the council’s “Trillema Index”, which has ranked countries on energy security, costs and decarbonisation efforts for the last six years. But the Brexit vote, cuts to renewable energy subsidies and planned changes on foreign ownership have created investment uncertainty and significant challenges for the UK, according to the latest edition of the index for the London-headquartered agency, whose members include energy companies across the world. The UK was also added to a watchlist of countries where negative changes are expected imminently, alongside the US, Germany and Japan. Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland took the top three positive slots in the ranking, with the UK now 11th. Despite the recent decision to go ahead with new nuclear reactors at Hinkley in Somerset, the UK had a “distinct lack of policy direction”, the council’s chief said. “Challenges in terms of improving affordability, and delivering security of supply as North Sea assets deplete, coupled with the rundown of worn-out legacy infrastructure, including coal-fired generation, has left the UK with a potential energy gap,” said Joan MacNaughton, executive chair of the council. “Renewables are increasing as a percentage of the UK energy mix but their output is not yet at a level where energy security can be guaranteed.” She added that ministers had not helped by making “myriad different changes” since 2013. It was not clear if Theresa May’s new government would back the “dash for gas” approach pushed by the former chancellor George Osborne under the last administration, said MacNaughton, adding that no alternative to gas had been made clear either. Gas has come to supply around half of the UK’s electricity generation this year, up from around a third in 2015, as several major coal plants shut. The result of the EU referendum vote in July has also cast a cloud over the government’s pledge last year to phase out coal power by 2025, as leaving the single market as part of a hard Brexit “could significantly increase the cost of its energy imports”. Imports via interconnectors to the continent accounted for around 6% of the UK’s electricity supply last year. Planned changes to rules on foreign ownership of energy infrastructure, announced during May’s review of Hinkley Point C contract, added to the investment uncertainty, the report said. The council also highlighted government cuts to onshore wind and solar subsidies since it took power, which Office for National Statistics figures showed last week had led solar power installations to crash. The changes could hinder investments in those sectors, the council said. The longer term future of support for low-carbon energy was unclear too, said MacNaughton. “The market knows some of what to expect until 2020 but after this point there are no answers to how the country will finance the low-carbon transition.” Dr Colin Brown, director of engineering at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said: “This report confirms that the UK government’s lack of clear energy policy is threatening the country’s future energy security.” He added: “The recent approval of the Hinkley Point C nuclear, while promising, is only part of the solution to the UK securing its low carbon energy requirements for the future.” Former Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, tweeted that the report showed the UK was a case study in “how not to run an energy policy.” A spokesman for the government said: “Keeping the lights on is non-negotiable and an absolute priority. We do not leave this up to chance, and the measures we have put in place through the capacity market, mean that homes and businesses will continue to have the supplies they need as we build an energy infrastructure fit for the 21st century. “The UK is a global leader in attracting investment and we are already seeing the fruits from this in our energy infrastructure with more offshore wind, solar energy and nuclear capacity being developed across the country. We will continue to work with industry and other key stakeholders to ensure that our future energy supplies remain clean, secure and affordable.” In a speech on Monday, the energy minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe, said that new nuclear would have a key role to play for the UK in ensuring security of supply, affordability and decarbonising the sector. “What might this look like in practice [meeting those criteria]? Where better to start than with Hinkley and nuclear new-build. Britain has a 60-year history as a global leader in nuclear power. Yet after the completion of the last new nuclear plant, Sizewell B in 1995, which I remember seeing while it was under construction, the nuclear industry was regrettably left to atrophy,” she told a summit in London. Offshore windfarms could also play a role if the industry drives down costs, and the safe extraction of shale gas could help on affordability and supply, she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/16/solar-power-race-is-on-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-16T15:27:27Z","webTitle":"The rush for solar power: buy now, before it's too late","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/solar-power-race-is-on-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/16/solar-power-race-is-on-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"The rush for solar power: buy now, before it's too late","bodyText":"“The biggest challenge was the grid connection,” says Donna Clarke with satisfaction. Clarke has worked in renewables for 15 years, and developed the UK’s only biodiesel plant before moving into solar energy. When the company she now works for, Scottow Moor Solar, arrived at RAF Coltishall in May last year, there was no means to plug the 50MW (megawatts) of power they thought could be generated on the former airfield – enough to run 15,000 homes – into the electricity supply. Nearly 18 months later, with phase one of East Anglia’s biggest solar farm completed on schedule in March, and a second phase planned, there are not one, but two connections to carry 33MW of power. One 7MW connection was bought from a developer whose planning application for two wind turbines had been refused following local objections. Negotiating a route for the other 26MW was more complicated, as the local grid was at full capacity, but Scottow Moor founder David Fyffe managed to persuade UK Power Networks (UKPN) to support a pilot, flexible-connection scheme, meaning the power can be turned down or “curtailed” when not needed. Phase two of the project will require a third connection for a further 20MW of power – bringing the total output to 50MW, making Scottow Moor one of the UK’s biggest solar farms. When I visited the site last month, there was a palpable sense of relief. Decommissioned military bases, with their poor infrastructure and decrepit buildings, are notoriously awkward to develop. But here in Norfolk, Scottow Moor’s backers think they’ve hit on a winning scheme – and in the nick of time. As the second phase of the Guardian’s Keep It in the Ground campaign has highlighted, solar power has gone through a remarkable period of growth since the demoralising Copenhagen climate summit in 2009: in the intervening six years, the cost of panels has fallen by 70%, with the government’s target of 750,000 domestic solar installations by 2020 reached this year. Following her promotion in May, energy secretary Amber Rudd promised to “unleash a new solar revolution”, singling out commercial rooftop developments, still a relative rarity in the UK, and perhaps thinking too of her Hastings constituents with their sun-kissed, southern roofs. But just three months later, she was announcing drastic cuts. In the next few weeks, Rudd, who used to work under chancellor George Osborne in the Treasury, will decide whether or not to reduce by almost 90% the feed-in tariff that subsidises small-scale solar installations, such as household roofs, from 1 January 2016. A consultation closes next week. For those considering installing solar panels, the race is already on. In the weeks since Rudd’s about-turn, several companies have already gone bust. “The rush is there. We are seeing it at many levels – large and small-scale, commercial rooftop, schools and residential,” says Reza Shaybani, chairman of the British Photovoltaic Association (BPVA). “I’m taking calls from members saying they will be doing the equivalent of eight months’ installations in the next three months, and as you can imagine, that will have an impact on safety and quality. No matter who you are, if you rush, you cut corners.” At Scottow Moor, the challenge was to get hold of and install 133,560 panels by the end of March to ensure that the project qualified for ROCs (Renewable Obligation Certificates). ROCs were one of the government’s ways of subsidising renewable energy projects greater than 5MW, until they were withdrawn from new, ground-mounted solar farms this year. The £30m project was completed in seven weeks, using 20 contractors, including three different suppliers of panels because one company could not make them quickly enough. Project manager Gareth Hawkins calls Scottow Moor “the fastest per-MW build in Europe”. The 600-acre site, which is a conservation area covered in listed buildings with a prison for sex offenders at one edge, is owned by Norfolk county council, and when I visited council leader George Nobbs was on hand to celebrate. With his white hair, pink tie and a red handkerchief in his top pocket, Nobbs cuts a genial and jaunty figure. “We’re one big happy family,” he says of Labour’s alliance with Liberal Democrats and Ukip, which ensures Labour and not the Conservatives leads the council, with support from the Greens. It was a Lib Dem, John Timewell, who suggested a solar farm in the first place, Nobbs says, and planning permission was granted by two Conservative-run district councils. After our interview, Nobbs gamely agrees to try to catch up with the sheep grazing under the panels for the Guardian’s photographer, so we can show how, on this flat patch of Norfolk, solar and livestock coexist (but sadly the sheep run away). Coltishall was bought for £4m under the previous council administration three years ago, and the deal with Scottow Moor Solar means Nobbs has now made this money back. Now he and his colleagues have to attract businesses to the empty offices and aircraft hangars that have been rebranded Scottow Enterprise Park, but have so far escaped the attention of satnav: the taxi driver who took me there could find no trace of street name or postcode. Everyone seems very pleased that TV company October Films has moved in, and plans to make a programme involving fast cars on the runway once used by Hurricanes and Spitfires and saved for reasons of nostalgia (the local village is called Badersfield, after fighter pilot Douglas Bader, who was briefly based here). More recently, says Hawkins, one of Scottow Moor’s investors used it to land a helicopter. Whether plans to regenerate the area economically will succeed remains to be seen. There have been complications: Scottow Moor Solar has already spent more than £350,000 having the site swept for ammunition. The council would like the park to become a hub for green businesses, and phase two of the solar farm will provide electricity to the four aircraft hangars it hopes to let. But if the story so far is one of success – of co-operation between the public and private sectors; of a local farmer working with developers (the grazing arrangements don’t work with cows or horses that are too heavy and can damage equipment, so it’s sheep or nothing); of cross-party co-operation and a community with strong feelings about its military heritage brought on side through consultation – both the politicians and developers who made it happen fear there won’t be many more like it. Partly because of the March cut-off for some subsidies, 2015 has been a bumper year for solar. Britain added more capacity last year than any other European country, and July set a new record, when on one glorious summer’s day 16% of all UK electricity was sun-powered – with around half coming from domestic rooftops, the rest from solar farms. In the same month Greg Barker, energy minister until he stood down from parliament in May, was named president of the British Photovoltaic Association (BPVA). In September, a poll for ICM found solar the most popular form of energy among voters of all parties – with 30% naming it their favourite, compared with 15% for nuclear and 13% for gas – and 78% saying the government should do more to help communities generate their own power. Solar was on a roll. But the recent change in government policy has cast a sudden shadow. Even if the government rows back on the extreme cuts proposed, as some of its own MPs would like it to, there is no doubt subsidies will shrink, and an industry set to deliver 1GW of new solar per year will have to scale back – with domestic and small-scale rooftop installations the most obvious victims, even though policy has been to support these in preference to ground-mounted solar on agricultural land. In the meantime, those companies that can are doing their best to make hay while the sun shines. Shaybani says the industry was prepared for a shock; orders were placed in advance and as a result, there is no shortage of modules right now. But a binge, he says, is the last thing the industry needs – especially when this looks set to be followed by a period of starvation. Since the subsidy cuts are in the cause of saving money – higher-than-expected demand for solar having led to overspending of the budget – he argues that by stimulating a run on solar panels, the government is making things worse. While he likens previous changes in the subsidy regime to bumps in the road, the industry is now, he says, at “the edge of a cliff”. “The redundancies we have seen are the tip of the iceberg,” he continues. “In any business, if your number of customers is limited you don’t need a big team.” Sonia Dunlop, spokesperson for the Solar Trade Association, agrees. “The industry already had a plan to wean itself off subsidies between 2020 and 2025,” she says, “but the caveat was that we needed a stable policy framework to get us there. It’s about energy independence and investment in cheaper energy over 20-30 years. For most people it’s definitely not a green thing.” Back in Norfolk, Clarke and Hawkins are getting stuck into phase 2 of Scottow Moor Solar’s farm. Around 43,000 more ground-mounted panels will be here by next spring, with work beginning in December. “Speed creates challenges, especially when there are complex issues to deal with around the grid,” says Clarke, “but we think our experience means this time round there will be few surprises. Obviously, the uncertainty around policy is not helpful. But this is a project that was always going to be completed. There is a need on site for this electricity supply, and locally it’s got a lot of support.” How many similar projects will get off the ground and whether, if they do, smaller rooftop solar will be squeezed out, remains to be seen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2020/may/20/coronavirus-live-news-brazil-sees-record-daily-deaths-as-world-bank-warns-60m-to-fall-into-extreme-poverty","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-20T23:42:40Z","webTitle":"Greece to restart tourism from 15 June – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/20/coronavirus-live-news-brazil-sees-record-daily-deaths-as-world-bank-warns-60m-to-fall-into-extreme-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2020/may/20/coronavirus-live-news-brazil-sees-record-daily-deaths-as-world-bank-warns-60m-to-fall-into-extreme-poverty","fields":{"headline":"Greece to restart tourism from 15 June – as it happened","bodyText":"We’ve launched a new blog at the link below – head there for rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, as cases worldwide increase by the highest one-day total so far: UK Ministers overruled permanent secretaries 11 times during pandemic Ministers responding to the coronavirus pandemic have on 11 occasions ordered their departments to override formal objections from their most senior civil servant, a report by Whitehall’s spending watchdog has found. In its first assessment of the government’s finances since responses began four months ago, the National Audit Office (NAO) disclosed that permanent secretaries challenged extraordinary spending pledges because they were conducted quickly and without the usual “value for money” checks. Secretaries of state issued ministerial directions to force the spending pledges through and made themselves solely accountable for the decisions, auditors said. There have been only 75 such directions in the past 30 years, according to the Institute for Government. Apple and Google have released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus. The companies had announced the unprecedented collaboration to leverage their technology to help trace and contain the spread of coronavirus last month, and say 22 countries and several US states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. The software relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus. Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven’t been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are omitting from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns. World sees largest daily rise in cases. The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours – the most in a single day so far. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown. Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. “The question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,” said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic. Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic.“I am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, D.C., at the legendary Camp David,” the US president tweeted on Wednesday. “The other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all – normalization!” International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years, according to World Trade Organization figures. Warning that there was little prospect of the downturn ending soon, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall precipitously in the first half of 2020. Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. “The tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,” Mitsotakis said in a televised address. South Africa records its first neonatal coronavirus death. South Africa has recorded its first neonatal coronavirus death, the country’s health ministry has said.The two-day old baby was born prematurely and had lung difficulties that required ventilation support immediately after birth, the health minister Zweli Mkhize said. France is to launch a complete shake-up of its health system, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, yet exposed by the pandemic. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the “salaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation” of staff, and to invest and reform financing of the health system. The arrival in Bangladesh of possibly the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicated coronavirus containment measures. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal. Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by the cyclone. Rights groups said governments were using the pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, who may have been at sea for months. The Trump administration called on the UN to remove references to sexual health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development, John Barsa, urged the UN to “stay focused on life-saving interventions”. The US president, Donald Trump, lashed out at Beijing, blaming it for “mass worldwide killing”. Trump referred to an unidentified “wacko in China”, in the latest in a series of attacks aimed at the country that he appears to be trying to frame as the centrepiece of his reelection bid. Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries – including Afghanistan where it has worked for 50 years – after it emerged that the global aid organisation had been bleeding cash during the coronavirus crisis. The NGO has seen its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises. Here is more on US president Donald Trump calling for an in-person G7 meeting. Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. “I am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, D.C., at the legendary Camp David,” the US president tweeted on Wednesday. “The other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all – normalization!” In March, the Republican president canceled the physical summit scheduled for June, moving to a video conference as nations grappled with the shutdown of international travel and multiple closures to fight the outbreak. The leaders’ April and May discussions were also moved to teleconference. But Trump, who is head of the G7 this year, said an in-person summit would be a symbol of the United States and other countries seeking to return to normal, something the president has urged should happen quickly despite concerns from public health experts. As we reported earlier, French president, Emmanuel Macron, is open to traveling to the United States for an in-person meeting of G7 leaders if the coronavirus pandemic situation allows, an Elysee official said on Wednesday. Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now. I’ll be bringing you all the latest – please do get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan at any time. In Brazil, 888 more people have died after becoming infected, while the country’s Health Ministry has confirmed a record increase in cases, with nearly 20,000 reported. That takes the total to 291,579. In the UK, overseas health and care workers on the coronavirus frontline have reacted with fury after Boris Johnson refused to exempt them from the NHS surcharge, insisting that it was “the right way forward”. In interviews with the Guardian’s Sarah Marsh and Harriet Grant, migrant health workers – who face an NHS bill of as much as £2,500 a year for a family of four – spoke out over a relentless working environment, struggles to pay their rent, and a heavy toll on their family life. “We feel insulted,” one said. “We are putting our lives and our family’s lives at risk.” The prime minister resisted pressure from Labour’s Keir Starmer to amend the policy, telling MPs that he “accepts and understands the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff” but added: “We must look at the realities … those contributions help us to raise about £900m.” Later, the IFS estimated that the contribution from overseas NHS staff amounted to around £90m. The head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has appealed for the world to work together to develop a vaccine, warning against any unilateral action that could prevent access for poor countries. Francesco Rocca, who heads the world’s largest disaster relief network, told Reuters: The reality is that there is this risk. Everyone must have access to these lifesaving treatments. On Tuesday, the United States rejected language in a World Health Organization resolution that was designed to ensure poor countries can have access to medicine, arguing that it sends “the wrong message to innovators who will be essential to the solutions the whole world needs”. Rocca said: If someone would say this is the intellectual property of this company ... and putting high prices on the vaccines, so making it impossible or very difficult to have access, this of course can have an impact on the most vulnerable. We want to prevent some unilateral decision that can effect the opportunity to have treatments and vaccines for everyone. Neglecting indigenous people during the pandemic is a “crime against humanity”, the mayor of the largest city in the Amazon rainforest has said. Arthur Virgilio Neto, the mayor of Manaus, said the virus is killing indigenous people and warned of a “genocide” if Brazil’s right-wing government fails to protect vulnerable tribes. So far, 25 indigenous people have died in the rainforest as the outbreak slowly penetrates remote villages. But more than 100 have been killed by the virus in urban areas, health authorities and indigenous groups said. “I fear a genocide,” said Neto, whose city is home to 2 million people and is the capital of Amazonas state. The mayor said the government of President Jair Bolsonaro was not concerned about the plight of indigenous people and doing nothing to save lives threatened by the outbreak. “It is a crime against humanity what they are doing here in my state of Amazonas, in my region.” he said. Bolsonaro’s office did not reply to Reuters’ requests for comment. Healthcare for indigenous people is the responsibility of the federal health ministry and its indigenous health service Sesai, which does not treat members of a tribe who have migrated away from their ancestral lands. Health experts say the outbreak that first broke out in the cities is now spreading to isolated areas where the population has no access to healthcare. Pan American Health Organization officials said in a virtual briefing on Tuesday they were particularly concerned about contagion in the tri-border area of the Amazon between Colombia, Peru and Brazil. South Africa has recorded its first neonatal coronavirus death, the country’s health ministry has said. The two-day old baby was born prematurely and had lung difficulties that required ventilation support immediately after birth, the health minister Zweli Mkhize said. The mother had tested positive for Covid-19 and the child subsequently tested positive for Covid-19 as well. It is important to appreciate the complexities of the underlying condition of prematurity. South Africa, which has the highest coronavirus infections in Africa, reported 803 new cases in a 24-hour cycle, taking the total to 18,003 while 8,950 people have recovered. Peru’s number of confirmed cases has surpassed 100,000, the country’s Ministry of Health has reported. There are 104,020 in the South American nation, which has been under nationwide lockdown since March, and the death toll rose to 3,024, the ministry said. Capt Tom Moore, whose sponsored walks in his garden raised £33m for NHS charities, has reacted with delight after it was confirmed he is to be knighted. “I think Sir Thomas sounds very nice,” he said. But he insisted the new title wouldn’t change him. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1,324 more deaths and 23,405 new cases; taking the totals to 91,664 and 1,528,235, respectively. A team of nurses working in Mexico City on the pandemic were rescued from a “virtual” kidnapping, in which kidnappers threaten their victims via telephone and video calls and coerce them through deception into making extortion payments. Investigators say the virtual kidnappers targeted the nurses – all staying in two hotels in the Mexican capital – and called their family members, saying they were being held and would be harmed if payment was not forthcoming. The nurses were warned not to try leaving their rooms; their virtual captors claimed to have control of the hotels’ security cameras and said they would attack any of the nurses if they were seen in the street. The Mexican Social Security Institute said in a statement that 13 of the 17 nurses in the team were subjected to the virtual kidnapping and were rescued by security forces on Tuesday. None of the nurses were injured and no arrests have been made. Judicial officials in the Mexican capital say detectives working on the case of a kidnapped Chiapas man stumbled upon the virtual kidnapping. The case of the virtual kidnappings was but the latest in a string of indignities committed against members of the medical profession as the Covid-19 pandemic escalates. Doctors, nurses and paramedics – all applauded in other countries – have suffered aggressions in public, including having bleach thrown on them. Many in the medical profession have stopped wearing their uniforms in public to avoid being assailed by people perceiving them as Covid-19 risks. Virtual kidnappings have proliferated in Mexico in recent years. Gerardo Priego, a former lawmaker now running an anti-kidnapping organisation, says such virtual crimes are often “so well-planned that many people fall into them and they are tricked so that their family members pay ... It’s very profitable and the bad guys don’t run any risks.” Brazil’s health ministry has issued new guidelines for wider use of anti-malarial drugs in mild coronavirus cases, a treatment touted by President Jair Bolsonaro in defiance of public health experts warning of possible health risks. The interim health minister Eduardo Pazuello, an army general on active duty, authorised the modified protocol after two trained doctors left the ministry’s top job under pressure to promote early use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The French president Emmanuel Macron is open to travelling to the United States for an in-person meeting of Group of Seven leaders if the coronavirus epidemic situation allows, an Elysee official has said. He’s open, he’s even willing to go there, but obviously with this caveat: Only if the sanitary conditions allow. Donald Trump, who is head of the G7 this year, had planned to hold this year’s summit at the presidential retreat of Camp David, Maryland, in June. In the UK, the test-and-trace system could be jeopardised by delays in obtaining test results, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned, as the government’s scientific advisers prepare to assess its effectiveness. Heather Stewart, Dan Sabbagh and Robert Booth write that the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is expected to grill the test-and-trace boss Dido Harding on Thursday amid concerns about whether the system will be robust enough to check the spread of the disease and allow the easing of lockdown measures from 1 June. Hunt, who has repeatedly called for “test, track and isolate” to be implemented, warned that a well-functioning system required test results to be rapidly obtainable. He said: For test and trace to work, you have to get the test results back quickly, and that will mean ironing out a lot of the problems that currently exist, with people waiting too long for their test results. All of Egypt’s 320 general hospitals are to offer testing to people showing symptoms, local authorities have announced. People with minor symptoms will be sent home as they await test results, while those showing serious symptoms will be kept in hospital, according to a government statement. Since 14 May, some patients with minor symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home rather than in quarantine hospitals. Egypt confirmed 745 new cases on Wednesday; the highest daily increase yet, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 14,229. The health ministry reported 21 more deaths, raising total deaths to 680. The number of people confirmed to have recovered stands at 3,994. The diplomatic clash between Beijing and Washington continues as the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calls China’s pledge of $2bn (£1.63bn) a “paltry” sum compared to the hundreds of thousands of lives lost and trillions of dollars of damage. Pompeo rejected Chinese president Xi Jinping’s claim that Beijing had acted with transparency after the initial outbreak and said that, if Xi wanted to show transparency, he should hold a news conference and allow reporters to ask him anything they liked. “President Xi claimed this week that China is acting with openness, transparency responsibility. I wish it were so,” Pompeo told a State Department news conference, accusing Beijing of continuing to withhold virus samples and access to facilities, to censor discussion, “and much, much more”. He added: I look forward to seeing them fulfil that $2bn commitment. China’s contributions to fighting the pandemic are paltry compared to the cost that they have imposed on the world. This plague has cost roughly 90,000 American lives, more than 36 million Americans have lost their jobs since March; globally 300,000 lives. Could be as much as $9tn, according to our estimates, cost imposition on the world of the Chinese Communist Party’s failures. Pundits have speculated that Donald Trump’s reelection strategy will focus on diverting attention from his own handling of the epidemic in the US by blaming China, where the pandemic started. The plan, a roadmap for the key industry, foresees tourist resorts welcoming holidaymakers two weeks earlier than expected. Initially, Mitsotakis had said “in the best case scenario” Greece would be accepting tourists from 1 July. But seeking to capitalise on the country’s unexpectedly successful handling of the pandemic, he announced that seasonal hotels could open from 15 June. The first tourists are expected to enter the country by car from neighbouring Balkan states that have also recorded low infection and mortality rates. With Athens keen to attract holidaymakers from the UK, its primary market, tax cuts were also announced. In a bid to make Greece more competitive for tour operators due to seal package deals in the coming days, the centre-right leader said duties on transport will be reduced from 24% to 13 % for the next five months. That would make boat, plane and bus tickets cheaper during the tourist season. Taxes on coffee, soft drinks and tickets for open-air cinemas, a mainstay of any Greek summer, will also be slashed. Greece has revved up the engines of its tourism industry, announcing that holidaymakers will be able to return to its beaches within weeks. In an address to the nation, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis declared 15 June as the official start date of a tourist season delayed by the pandemic. Direct flights between Greece and the UK and other international destinations will resume on 1 July, with airlines flying straight into island airports gradually thereafter. Holidaymakers will not be quarantined but they will be tested, Mitsotakis insisted in an attempt to allay fears of the virus being imported from abroad. Here are the latest headlines in the global coronavirus crisis: Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. “The question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,” said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

France is to launch a complete shake-up of its health system, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, yet exposed by the pandemic. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the “salaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation” of staff, and to invest and reform financing of the health system. The arrival in Bangladesh of possibly the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicated coronavirus containment measures. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal. Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by the cyclone. Rights groups said governments were using the pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, who may have been at sea for months. The Trump administration called on the UN to remove references to sexual health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development, John Barsa, urged the UN to “stay focused on life-saving interventions”. The US president, Donald Trump, lashed out at Beijing, blaming it for “mass worldwide killing”. Trump referred to an unidentified “wacko in China”, in the latest in a series of attacks aimed at the country that he appears to be trying to frame as the centrepiece of his reelection bid. Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries – including Afghanistan where it has worked for 50 years – after it emerged that the global aid organisation had been bleeding cash during the coronavirus crisis. The NGO has seen its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises. That’s it from me, Damien Gayle. I’ll leave you in the capable hands of my colleague Kevin Rawlinson. The discovery of new coronavirus cases in two students has marred the reopening of schools in South Korea, Reuters reports. Seventy-five high schools turned pupils away on Wednesday, amid fears among some teachers that it was unsafe for classes to resume. Some students were sent home almost as soon as they had walked through their school gates for the first time this year, after the two high school seniors tested positive in Incheon on Wednesday morning, the education ministry said. The beginning of the spring semester had been postponed several times since March as South Korea battled the first large coronavirus outbreak outside China, with classes held online. South Korea has reported 11,110 coronavirus cases, with 263 deaths. Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries – including Afghanistan where it has worked for 50 years – after it emerged that the global aid organisation had been bleeding cash during the coronavirus crisis, writes Guardian global development reporter Peter Beaumont. The agency has seen its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises. Still suffering from a fall in donations from the public in the UK because of the Haiti sex abuse scandal, and heavily dependent on its shops in a number of European countries – to the tune of £5m a week – Oxfam’s other sources of funding had also begun drying up. Oxfam Australia had already made deep cuts earlier this month, while cuts in the UK to Oxfam GB were also foreseen. Oxfam currently operates in 66 countries and 20 affiliates. It will retain a physical presence in 48 countries, six of which it will explore as new independent affiliate members. The UK has reported 363 more deaths from Covid-19, taking the official death toll in Europe’s worst-affected country to 35,704. According to the daily update, out of 60,744 people tested for the coronavirus, 2,472 came back positive. There have been 248,293 officially confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK so far - the second highest number in Europe. Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. “The tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,” Mitsotakis said in a televised address, according to AFP. With Greece suffering fewer than 170 COVID-19 deaths over two months into the pandemic, Mitsotakis said the country’s prompt response to the virus would be a “passport of safety, credibility and health” to attract visitors. “We will win the economy war just as we won the health battle,” he said. The tourism minister, Harry Theocharis, said a list of nations resuming flights to Greece would be announced by the end of May, noting that Athens would focus on reviving a travel front “from the Balkans to the Baltic.” Bulgarians and northern Europeans including Germans will be among the first visitors, the minister said, in addition to Israelis and Cypriots. The country, which is still recovering from a decade-long debt crisis, badly needs tourism income that directly and indirectly accounts for over a fifth of its economy. In Chile, political opponents, academics and health workers have demanded greater transparency over Covid-19 death tolls, writes Charis McGowan in Santiago. With 53,617 confirmed cases of infection, Chile has the third highest number of coronavirus cases in South America. With a case-fatality rate of around 1% (totalling 544), Chile’s Health Ministry has pointed out that the country has achieved one of the lowest fatality rates among the OECD nations, well below the global average of 6.8%. However, a document published last week from the Civil Register revealed 4,201 deaths in caused by “respiratory disease” between 3 March and 29 April. Compared to data from the Department of Health Statistics and Information (DEIS), this would indicate a 57.2% increase in respiratory deaths from the year before, suggesting that this year’s excess of 2,000+ respiratory-related deaths could be related to the novel coronavirus. The information, tweeted by investigative journalist and scholar Alejandra Matus, sparked a frenzy of comment on social media. Within hours of the post going viral, the Health Ministry clarified that numbers confirmed by the Department of Health Statistics and Information totalled 1,949 respiratory-related deaths from March to May, an 8% increase to the year before. “Each institution maintains its responsibilities within the scope of its competence,” said the Health Ministry in a statement to the Guardian. “The Health Ministry maintains the responsibility of establishing and defining the codification of the cause of death.” Meanwhile, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) revealed that all official death statistics in Chile must be cross-checked by the Health Ministry, the Civil Registry, and the INE — a process that takes up to two years to verify and validate before publishing. “The Health Ministry’s numbers appeared within hours in response to a tweet,” Matus told the Guardian. “Officially, they haven’t even finished processing the numbers from 2018. So how are these new numbers any more valid than the Civil Registry ones?” Speaking on a local radio station last Friday, the health minister, Jamie Mañalich, explained that the Civil Registry counts respiratory illness as a cause of death in combination with principal causes of death. “It includes a person who has bronchial asthma and who died in a traffic accident,” he said. Yet the discrepancy between the numbers has caused concern. “It is not acceptable that Civil Registry figures are not consistent with those provided by the Ministry of Health,” said deputy Andrea Parra. The Doctor’s Union has demanded greater transparency over death tolls, highlighting that current figures include “anomalous data”. Switzerland has told its ministry of defence to secure adequate supplies of coronavirus vaccine, as fears grow of a global struggle over supplies when one is finally developed. So far, no vaccine has so far been created to protect people from the virus, but it is widely thought that the crisis can only be brought to an end when one is deelopmed and rolled out to huge numbers of the world’s population. Concerns are growing that some nations, such as the United States, could seek to hoard a successful candidate, once it comes, since manufacturing capacity is unlikely to be sufficient to supply global needs. Even after the first wave of the pandemic is over, immunity levels around the world will be so low that vaccine will be essential, Reuters reported the Swiss government as saying, potentially sparking a race by nations to grab what they can, to the detriment of others. “The goal is clear: The Swiss population should have the fastest possible access to a safe, effective vaccine,” Swiss Health Minister Alain Berset said. “But we also know there’s a big, global discussion going on, and need will be huge worldwide. All countries should have fair access to a vaccine.” Switzerland’s interior ministry and defence department have been given the job of leading contract negotiations to secure enough doses to treat the nation’s 8.6 million population, the government said, estimating costs at around 300 million Swiss francs ($310.82 million) for such a supply. Nearly two-dozen people have escaped from coronavirus quarantine centres in Zimbabwe, the Associated Press reports, citing local media. The state-run Herald newspaper reported that 23 people had escaped in the past week, including 19 who were being held at a hotel in Beitbridge, a usually busy border town. The Zimbabwean authorities are using schools, colleges and hotels for the mandatory isolation of people entering the country during a lockdown that is now in its sixth week. Some returnees have complained about poor conditions at quarantine centres. Zimbabwe has so far reported 46 cases of coronavirus, and four deaths from Covid-19. Egypt will deduct 1% from people’s salaries for 12 months from 1 July to offset the economic repercussions of the coronavirus, according to a draft law approved by the cabinet on Wednesday, Reuters reports. The tax will be imposed across all sectors of the economy in both the public and private sectors for net monthly salaries exceeding 2,000 Egyptian pounds ($127), the cabinet said in a statement. A tax of 0.5% will be deducted from state pensions. The measure comes as Egypt tries to deal with the economic impact of the pandemic, which has brought tourism to a standstill, triggered major capital flight, and threatened remittances from Egyptians working overseas. On Wednesday, Egypt reported that 745 more people had tested positive for coronavirus and 21 people had died from Covid-19. The total death toll in the country is now 680, of a total 14,229 confirmed cases. Deaths from coronavirus in Italy rose by 161 on Wednesday, one fatality less than on Tuesday, bringing the death toll to 32,330, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian’s Rome correspondent. New infections increased by 665, down from 813 on Tuesday, according to figures from the civil protection authority. Mayors of towns and cities across Italy threatened to close bars again after seeing images of crowds gathering for an evening drink on Tuesday, with many people not wearing masks. Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, warned “now is not the time for street parties”. “Otherwise the curve starts heading back up,” he was quoted by Ansa as saying. “We lifted the need for self-declaration forms [previously required for venturing out] because the curve was under control, but nobody should think that the rules of precaution have been lifted.” There are 62,752 people who are currently infected with the virus, 676 of whom are in intensive care. The country has 227,364 confirmed coronavirus cases to date, including the deaths and 132,282 survivors. Churches and other places of worship can reopen in Switzerland from next week, the government announced on Wednesday, AFP reports. “Normal life is coming back,” the health minister, Alain Berset, said after the government brought the move forward by a week. “Mass, worship, marriages, baptisms” and other events in places of worship will all be allowed to resume from 28 May, he told a press conference. Switzerland stopped short of imposing strict confinement in measures introduced in mid-March aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus. It has been gradually lifting its restrictions since barbers, florists, family doctors and hardware stores were allowed to reopen on 27 April. The rates of infection, hospitalisation and death have flattened off in recent weeks, according to the health ministry. On Wednesday, Swiss public health authorities reported one new Covid-19 death, and 40 new confirmed cases of coronavirus. The total death toll from the disease so far in the country now stands at 1,630, out of 30,658 infected patients. The prime minister of Italy has warned that the EU’s coronavirus recovery plan needs to be more ambitious or the bloc risked fuelling nationalism and widening long-term divisions. While he welcomed the surprise entente between Berlin and Paris to back a 500 billion euro ($550 billion) rescue plan as “a bold and significant step”, Giuseppe Conte said “much more needs to be done”. In an op-ed on the politico.eu news website, Conte said: It has quickly become clear that the economic cost of this pandemic is going to be as unprecedented as its impact to public health, putting in danger not just jobs and business in EU member countries but also threatening the fundamental pillars of our union, starting with the single market and the supply chains it facilitates. By its nature, the coronavirus crisis is a symmetric shock, affecting all countries and regions, that cannot be effectively faced by individual countries alone. It did not take me long to be convinced of this, and I have been raising awareness among other European leaders about the urgent need for a coordinated economic response. The risk has long been clear: Europe cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past by doing too little or reacting too slowly. Failure to act swiftly will result in a sharp widening of divergences among EU member countries. Four European countries - Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden - are expected to propose an alternative to the Franco-German recovery plan, asking for more guarantees that states receiving aid will adopt reforms, AFP reports. They will also say aid should take the form of loans rather than grants, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Wednesday. Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by super-cyclone Amphan, writes Rebecca Ratcliffe, the Guardian’s south-east Asia correspondent. Rights groups say governments are using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, and warn those on board may have been at sea for months. Amnesty said the refugees’ lives are at immediate risk, as the Bay of Bengal, where some boats were recently rescued, is facing its biggest storm for decades. It’s thought that some of the boats are carrying refugees attempting to flee the desperate conditions in Cox’s Bazar refugee camp in Bangladesh, where 1 million Rohingya refugees have sheltered for years after fleeing persecution in Myanmar. The location of the boats is not known, though last week it was reported that at least two vessels carrying Rohingya were believed to have been spotted off the coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh. “They are in rickety boats, these are fishing trawlers that they use to take a very dangerous route in the hope of a better life. The Bangladesh government and others must do everything to save their lives,” said Saad Hammadi, Amnesty International’s south Asia campaigner. Louise Donovan, a spokesperson for the UN Refugee Agency, added that it is not clear how exactly many people remain adrift but that the storm could be devastating for those stranded. “The sea is extremely rough at the moment, and if there are any boats that are trying to disembark we would ask governments in the region to assist them,” she said. Earlier this month, hundreds of Rohingya Muslims, including children, were rescued from another boat and escorted by Bangladesh to Bhasan Char, an uninhabited silt island that aid groups warn is isolated and prone to flooding and cyclones. The UN has offered to conduct a risk assessment of the island prior to any refugees being relocated, but this is yet to happen. On Wednesday, authorities in Bangladesh said the 306 Rohingya who remain on the island have been taken to cyclone centres. Officials have previously said that rescued Rohingya were being taken to Bhasan Char as a quarantine measure, to prevent the risk of people bringing coronavirus into the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. Just last week, the virus had been detected for the first time in the crowded camps, prompting agencies to warn of a looming humanitarian disaster. In Cox’s Bazar on Wednesday morning, a third red flag was raised as a warning sign that extreme weather is approaching and that all refugees must stay inside. It is hoped that the eye of the cyclone will miss the camp, though agencies still fear flooding, tidal surges and strong winds that could tear apart the flimsy shelters in which families live. There are no cyclone shelters available to refugees in the camps, instead, communities have been given “tie-down kits”, sets of pegs and ropes, to try to strengthen the structures that do exist. “We’re as prepared as we can be in a very difficult situation and also when dealing with Covid-19 at the same time it is very, very challenging,” added Donovan. “The United States continues to demonstrate global leadership in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the US state department has insisted. A lengthy press release published the USAID website, but in the name of the department of state, says that, despite Donald Trump’s threats to permanently end US funding of the World Health Organization, the US government is still distributing billions to countries and NGOs for coronavirus relief efforts. It says: Through the American people’s generosity and the U.S. Government’s action, the United States continues to demonstrate global leadership in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. The American people have given more than $10 billion that will benefit the global Covid-19 response, and we continue to ensure that the substantial U.S. funding and scientific efforts on this front remain a central and coordinated part of the worldwide effort against Covid-19. Months into fighting this pandemic at home and abroad, the United States continues to lead a global response—building on decades of leadership in life-saving health and humanitarian assistance. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, the US Government has committed more than $900 million in State Department and US Agency for International Development (USAID) emergency health, humanitarian, economic, and development assistance specifically aimed at helping governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) fight the pandemic. This funding, provided by Congress, will save lives by improving public health education; protecting healthcare facilities; and increasing laboratory, disease-surveillance, and rapid-response capacity in more than 120 countries. The United States has mobilized as a nation to make this an impressive global effort. Working with the private sector, we have begun to fulfill President Trump’s commitment to provide ventilators to our partners and allies in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The first shipment of ventilators donated by the United States, through USAID, arrived in the Republic of South Africa on May 11, 2020. Our foreign assistance funding to date for the response to the COVID-19 pandemic includes an initial $23 million specifically to provide ventilators to some of these partners and allies. We expect to make future additional purchases and shipments of ventilators and related supplies. You can read more by clicking through. Peru seemed to be doing everything right. Its president, Martín Vizcarra, announced one of the earliest coronavirus lockdowns in Latin America on 16 March. In stark contrast to his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro – who has deliberately undermined social distancing and quarantine measures – Peru’s leader strictly adhered to the World Health Organization’s coronavirus recommendations and mobilised the police and army to enforce a stringent quarantine. But more than two months later the country is one of the region’s worst hit by Covid-19 and has been unable to flatten the curve of infections. Peru now ranks second only to Brazil in Latin America with more than 99,483 cases and a death toll of 2,914 according to official figures on Tuesday. Dan Collyns, the Guardian’s man in Lima, looks into the reasons why: Just over 7% of people in Stockholm are carrying antibodies that would protect them against coronavirus infection, a survey by Sweden’s public health authority has found. The findings come from the first results of the agency’s investigation into the presence of antibodies against the virus in the population. They will be likely to be seized upon by critics of Sweden’s “herd immunity” strategy. The country has eschewed the kinds of lockdowns imposed by government’s elsewhere in the world to curb the spread of the virus, in favour of allowing it to spread throughout the population in the hope that natural immunity will be achieved. So far Sweden has recorded 3,831 deaths from Covid-19, a far higher total death toll than its neighbours, which brought in strict lockdown measures. Stockholm, the capital, has been the worst hit region. According to the public health authority’s press release on the study (rendered into English by Google Translate): The analyses for week 18 (a total of 1,104 analysed samples) show, as expected, the largest proportion of positive antibody tests in Stockholm. A total of 7.3% of the blood samples collected from people in Stockholm were positive in the antibody study, which can be compared with a total of 4.2% in Skåne and 3.7% in Västra Götaland. The numbers reflect the state of the epidemic earlier in April, as it takes a few weeks for the body’s immune system to develop antibodies. Regarding age differences, the results show that Covid-19 antibodies were most common among people between 20 and 64 years. In total, 6.7% of the samples in this group were positive, which can be compared with 4.7% in the age group 0-19 years and 2.7% in the age group 65-70 years. France is to launch a complete shake-up of the country’s health system, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, but whose failings have been revealed by the coronavirus crisis, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian’s Paris correspondent. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the “salaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation” of staff in hospitals and state-run nursing homes and to invest and reform financing of the health system. After a council of ministers (cabinet) meeting this morning, it was announced the plan will be launched next Monday (25 May) with a national consultation. This is Macron’s way of saying thank you to underpaid, overworked hospital and care home staff at the frontline of dealing with Covid-19, Olivier Véran, the French health minister, speaking after the meeting, said. “Nothing will be as it was before. France has seen what it owes its nurses and carers … their work is the pride of the whole nation.” In a brief mea culpa, he said the government had not acted “quickly or strongly enough” in its hospital reforms in recent years. He said “radical measures” were needed to combat the nurses’ “malaise”, and not just pay rises. He said France needed a “health system that was renewed and rearmed and capable of dealing with all risks, all threats”. Thousands of delegates streaming into Beijing for China’s most important political event of the year have undergone nucleic acid tests and quarantines amid what state media have called “wartime measures”, writes Lily Kuo, the Guardian’s Beijing correspondent. The National People’s Congress is usually a two-week affair of pomp and pageantry but this year’s event has been shortened and some sessions will be held over video link. Railway stations have implemented extra screening for travellers coming to the capital and residential communities are meant to maintain strict “close management” – allowing only registered residents in and out. Officials have temporarily banned the sale of petrol in bulk, as well as firecrackers. Balloons for sporting events or other types of aerial advertising are also barred. Even more so than other years, it is critical that the parliamentary session – which coincides with the meeting of an advisory body, collectively known as “two sessions” – goes off without a hitch. The event, a time for China’s political elite to rubber-stamp policies and indicate new policy directions, was delayed for two months because of the coronavirus. In holding the two sessions, which begin on Thursday and Friday, Beijing is not only signalling its victory over the virus but is trying to emphasise control and leadership as it tries to move on from the pandemic. China is in unchartered territory of economic struggle and discontent at home and increased hostility from abroad, which makes the event especially important for its leader, Xi Jinping, who over the years has centralised power and embodies the government’s response to crises. A US drug company has said its experimental coronavirus vaccine has been shown to produce protective antibodies and immune responses in mice and guinea pigs, Reuters reports. Inovio is one of dozens of companies and teams around the world racing to produce a vaccine for the virus. Experts predict a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop. David Weiner, director of the vaccine and immunotherapy centre at the Wistar institute, which has collaborated with Inovio, said: We saw antibody responses that do many of the things we would want to see in an eventual vaccine. We are able to target things that would prevent the virus from having a safe harbour in the body. Inovio, which began human testing of its vaccine in April, said preliminary results from that trial are expected in June. Human development - the combination of rises in education, health and living standards - could decline this year for the first time since the concept was introduced in 1990, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has said. UNDP said the impact was being felt all over the world, in both rich and poor countries, but added that the pandemic, and the crisis it had caused, was acting as “a magnifying glass for inequalities.” UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said: The world has seen many crises over the past 30 years, including the global financial crisis of 2007-09. Each has hit human development hard but, overall, development gains accrued globally year-on-year. COVID-19 – with its triple hit to health, education, and income – may change this trend. Countries that are less able to cope with the social and economic fallout of worldwide lockdown would be likely to face a much steeper drop in development, the agency said. Pedro Conceição, Director of the Human Development Report Office at UNDP, said: This crisis shows that if we fail to bring equity into the policy toolkit, many will fall further behind. This is particularly important for the ‘new necessities’ of the 21st century, such as access to the Internet, which is helping us to benefit from tele-education, tele-medicine, and to work from home. More than a million people in South Africa could be infected by coronavirus, causing at least 40,000 deaths, by the time the disease reaches a likely peak in the country in November, scientists have said. A consortium called the Modelling and Simulation Hub Africa (MASHA), comprising experts from the University of Cape Town and the Department of Health, released its first projections of the impact of the pandemic late Tuesday, according to a report by AFP. In an optimistic scenario there would be just over 40,000 deaths by November, said MASHA’s head, Sheetal Silal. In a pessimistic scenario, the death toll would be 45,000-48,000, she said. Silal stressed the wide degree of uncertainty for making forecasts at this stage. “Here we are trying to make projections on the entire span of the epidemic for the next six to eight months, so there is considerable uncertainty,” she said. South Africa reported its first coronavirus case on 5 March. Its registered tally now stands at 17,200 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 312 deaths, in a country of 57 million.

In the United States, where Donald Trump continues to point the finger at China, a new nationally-representative survey has shown that the vast majority of the country’s nurses say they have not been tested for Covid-19, are reusing personal protective equipment, or have exposed skin or clothing while caring for coronavirus patients. The survey finds that “dangerous health care workplace conditions have become the norm” since Covid-19 spread widely within the United States, said the union which conducted the survey. More than 100 nurses have died since the beginning of the pandemic. “We’ve known for years we’re behind,” said Jean Ross, president of National Nurses United. Not because we couldn’t have what we needed – because we are the richest country on the planet – but because of greed, because of the profit system that doesn’t really look out for the welfare of patients, therefore it couldn’t possibly look out for the welfare of workers.” The survey asked more than 23,000 nurses across all 50 states and Washington DC about their working conditions since the pandemic started. The survey represents the period between 15 April and 10 May, and was conducted by National Nurses United. It included both union and non-union nurses. Donald Trump has lashed out at China over the Covid-19 pandemic, blaming Beijing for “mass Worldwide killing”. In a tweet, the US president referred to an unidentified “wacko in China,” in the latest of a series of attacks aimed at the country which he appears to be framing as the centrepiece of his reelection bid. Trump, who initially played down the seriousness of the threat, later changed course and blamed China for allowing the international spread of coronavirus. The worldwide Covid-19 death toll stands at 323,000. Trump wrote: “Some wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people. Please explain to this dope that it was the “incompetence of China”, and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing!” Trump did not specify which statement he was referring to but it follows a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman hitting back after Trump sent a lengthy letter outlining America’s belief that the World Health Organization had not been sufficiently independent of China, and had been too willing to accept its explanations for the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. China’s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, described Trump’s letter as slanderous. “The US leadership’s open letter is … trying to mislead the public … to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China’s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,” Zhao said. The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments – including the UK – on disease control. “The question is when and how big, that is the question in my view”, says Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). It has been the unenviable task of scientists to tell it as it is through the coronavirus pandemic. While politicians have been caught offering empty reassurances, the epidemiologists, a job description fresh to many, have emerged as the straight shooters of the crisis, sometimes to their detriment. Ammon, a former adviser to the German government, is frank in her views in her first interview with a UK newspaper since the crisis began. “Looking at the characteristics of the virus, looking at what now emerges in from the different countries in terms of population immunity – which isn’t all that exciting between 2% and 14%, that leaves still 85% to 90% of the population susceptible – the virus is around us, circulating much more than January and February … I don’t want to draw a doomsday picture but I think we have to be realistic. That it’s not the time now to completely relax.” In Hong Kong, where authorities have effectively banned an annual vigil for the Tiananmen Square massacre by extending Covid-19 physical distancing measures for another 14 days, people are being urged to instead light candles. Following months of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong, the 4 June anniversary of the Chinese military’s slaughter of innocent student protesters in 1989 is likely to be particularly poignant. Tens of thousands of people in Hong Kong have joined sombre and peaceful candlelit vigils in years gone as part of the world’s biggest commemoration of the 1989 crackdown in Beijing, when Chinese troops opened fire on student-led protesters. But after Hong Kong authorities said on Tuesday that the limit on group gatherings to no more than eight people would be extended at least until 4 June, an organiser is calling for a different approach. Lee Cheuk-yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organises the annual vigils, told Reuters he believed the motive for the extension was “political suppression”. “We have to have a plan B,” Lee said. “Instead of one point, we will do it everywhere, still with the powerful candlelight to condemn the massacre and mourn for those who died in 1989.” Police have still to respond to an application for the vigil to be held in Victoria Park, Lee said, adding that he was not optimistic. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday health measures were not based on political considerations. Hello, readers. This is Simon Murphy now covering the global live blog while my colleague, Damien Gayle, takes a break. The Trump administration has called on the UN to remove references to sexual and reproductive health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan (HRP), writes Liz Ford, deputy editor of the Guardian’s Global development website. In a letter to the UN secretary-general António Guterres on Monday, John Barsa, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development (USAid), called on the UN to “stay focused on life-saving interventions” and not include abortion as an essential service. Barsa’s letter said the plan “unfortunately … does just this, by cynically placing the provision of ‘sexual and reproductive health services’ on the same level of importance as food insecurity, essential health care, malnutrition, shelter, and sanitation”. He highlighted the $650.7m (£530m) USAid had contributed to pandemic funding. It was essential the UN’s response avoided creating controversy, it read. “Therefore, I ask that you remove references to ‘sexual and reproductive health’, and its derivatives from the Global HRP, and drop the provision of abortion as an essential component of the UN’s priorities to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.” New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has suggested employers consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues. Ardern said people had suggested everything from the shorter work week to more public holidays as a means to stimulate the economy and encourage domestic tourism, while the borders remain closed to foreign nationals. International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years, according to World Trade Organization figures revealing the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, writes Richard Partington, the Guardian’s economics correspondent. Warning that there was little evidence of the downturn ending soon as Covid-19 brings the world economy to an effective standstill, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall “precipitously” in the first-half of 2020. The WTO’s quarterly goods trades barometer, which provides real-time information on the trajectory of world merchandise trade relative to recent trends, slumped to 87.6 on a scale where anything below 100 indicates a downturn in activity. Suggesting a sharp contraction in world trade extending into the second-quarter of 2020, the reading was the lowest value on record since the indicator was launched in July 2016. The Netherlands reported thirty-three new deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, as 198 more people tested positive for the coronavirus. According to the Dutch national institute for public health and the environment (RIVM), 44,447 people have so far been diagnosed as infected with the virus, of whom 5,748 have died. There have been 11,627 patients treated in hospital as a result of the outbreak, with 14 new admissions reported by RIVM on Wednesday. Eighty-eight more people have been recorded as dying from Covid-19 in Sweden, bringing the country’s total death toll to 3,831. The latest update from Sweden’s health authority also showed that 724 more people had tested positive for the coronavirus that causes the disease. Sweden has not followed the rest of the world in imposing strict restrictive measures and business closures to contain the spread of the virus. The reality TV star Kim Kardashian West is the latest designer to capitalise on the coronavirus crisis by launching a line of face masks – and has sparked a race row in the process, writes Morwenna Ferrier, the Guardian’s acting joint fashion editor. Launched over the weekend under the celebrity’s shapewear label, Skims, the non-medical seamless masks come in five skin tones and reportedly sold out in less than 30 minutes. There is now a waiting list for them. But their runaway success came hand in hand with accusations of “casual racism”, according to some on social media, who pointed out that one of the masks was not the right nude shade for a black model. The Skims site has now changed the model and the mask she wears. Skims had not responded to the Guardian’s request for comment at time of publication. Police in Sri Lanka have arrested more than 60,000 people over the past two months for breaking a curfew imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus, Xinhua reports. A 24-hour curfew has been in force in the capital, Colombo, and its outskirts since 20 March, while the rest of the country is under nighttime curfew. An end date to movement restrictions has not been specified. According to a statement published on Wednesday by the Sri Lankan police, seen by Xinhua, China’s official news agency, 60,425 people had been arrested since the curfew was imposed, for infractions such as loitering on the roads, gathering and consuming alcohol at public grounds, travelling by vehicle on the roads and behaving in an unruly manner while intoxicated. The epidemiology unit of Sri Lanka’s ministry of health on Wednesday reported four new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total in the country to 1,027. Of those, 584 patients have recovered and 434 were under medical care. Nine people have died from Covid-19. With Greece about to unveil its much-awaited tourism plan, some are gearing up with a gusto for the season, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian’s Athens correspondent. As the country gradually emerges into the post-lockdown age and restrictions are eased, beaches have been opened up. But some bathers - extending the notion of the “new normal” to the sea - are taking no chances. On Mykonos, one swimmer was snapped in masks and gloves as he had a paddle in the waters off the Cycladic isle - which is, like all Greek islands, still mercifully coronavirus-free. Hats off to Ioannis Alexopoulos. In a rare success story Greece has virtually eradicated the virus after enforcing draconian measures to curb the spread of the virus early on. Nigeria’s largest medical union has instructed its health staff in Lagos to end their hospital shifts at 6pm each day, 2-hours before the city-wide curfew, in response to rising reports of police harassment, writes Emmanuel Akinwotu, the Guardian’s West Africa correspondent. There is an 8pm curfew in Lagos under its gradually easing lockdown measures, but in recent days reports have been rife of harassment and abuse by police officers to essential workers, after 8pm. The Nigerian Medical Association president, Dr. Francis Faduyile, told The Guardian that authorities were policing the lockdown curfew indiscriminately. “Yesterday a lot of senior doctors were stopped from going home after hours by police,” he said. “We should be asking them why they are doing this.” “Doctors will stay at home after 6pm to prevent themselves from being embarrassed and molested by police officers,” he added. Lagos’ lockdown curfew exempts essential workers, yet there is insufficient clarity between different agencies on who qualifies. Faduyile said the government needed to clarify to police that health workers were essential. Yesterday videos and pictures showed police in different parts of Nigeria’s most populous city, mounting roadblocks after 8pm for hours before letting commuters go. Security agencies policing the lockdowns in Nigeria have come under scrutiny amid reports of abuses. Lagos is the most affected city in Nigeria’s Covid-19 outbreak, with 2,750 of Nigeria’s 6,400 infections. Cases in the country continue to rise, doubling in just over a fortnight, but test capacity has only marginally improved over that time. Africa’s most populous country has administered just 37,000 tests, “a far cry from what is needed” Faduyile said, and low compared to other African countries. Neighbouring Ghana and South Africa have tested 170,000 and 475,000 respectively. Compounding challenges with the availability of test kits, poor infrastructure had made it hard to distribute its limited supply, and to transport test samples around the country, Faduyile said. More than 90,000 people in Africa have been infected with the coronavirus, according to the latest daily update from the World Health Organization’s regional office for the continent. On Wednesday, Antonio Guterres praised the “brave prevention measures” imposed by African governments to curb the spread of the virus, after a the kind of widespread outbreak predicted across the continent failed to materialise. However there have been consistent criticisms of civil rights abuses, police brutality, and millions left unable to make ends meet. The South Korean football club FC Seoul are facing penalties, including expulsion from their own stadium, for putting sex dolls in empty seats during a match last weekend, according to the Associated Press. The K-League is one of the few football leagues operating during the coronavirus pandemic, with games being played in empty stadiums but FC Seoul’s attempts to increase the atmosphere at Seoul World Cup Stadium backfired after their 1-0 win over Gwangju on Sunday. The club expressed their sincere remorse as a public backlash intensified, but said they were assured by a supplier that they were using mannequins not sex dolls to mimic a home crowd. About 25 mannequins were supplied by a local company and dressed in FC Seoul colours and wearing masks. The Yonhap news agency reported that fans posted suspicions about the life-size dolls on social media during the match and one banner showed the names of an adult toy manufacturer and of models who had inspired those dolls. Here are the latest headlines in our global coronavirus coverage: The global confirmed cases of coronavirus has topped 4.9 million, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. According to their tally, at least 323,653 people are known to have died from Covid-19 while at least 4,915,004 are confirmed as having been infected. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Russia passed 300,000. The number, already the second highest in the world, now stands at 308,705, after 8,764 coronavirus infections were reported on Wednesday, but the daily increase was the lowest since 1 May. The Spanish government has confirmed that the wearing of face masks will be compulsory from Thursday in enclosed areas and on streets when the required two-metre social distancing protocols cannot be followed. While children under six will be exempt from the order, masks are recommended for children aged three to five. The aerospace manufacturer Rolls-Royce is to cut at least 9,000 jobs from its global staff of 52,000, due to an anticipated fall in air travel following the coronavirus pandemic. The British company said the job losses would predominantly affect its civil aerospace business, plus its central support functions. UN secretary general António Guterres said that the developed world could learn lessons from African countries’ preventative measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent. Brazil confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full. New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues. South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time since the pandemic began, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Sixteen more people have died from Covid-19 in Bangladesh, as the arrival of what could be the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicates efforts to maintain measures to curb the spread of the disease. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety, officials said, as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal. The highest level of alert was raised at 6am, said Enamur Rahman, the junior minister for disaster management and relief. It came as the latest update from the Bangladesh’s institute of epidemiology, disease control and research (IEDCR), reported that 1,617 more people had tested positive for the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, the most in a single day since widespread testing began in the country. So far Bangladesh has recorded 26,738 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 386 deaths from the Covid-19 respiratory disease it can cause. Videos and photos showed people heading to shelters, some carrying bags with their belongings and all wearing masks to protect against coronavirus. Officials went from village to village with loudspeakers warning people to take shelter. In Sathira district, the local chief government administrator, SM Mostafa Kamal, said evacuees were given dry food, baby food and medicine. He said officials were distributing masks and other safety equipment to keep coronavirus from spreading while people stay in thousands of shelters. The cyclone slowed slightly as it reached cooler waters near the coast. But with wind speeds ranging between 160 and 170 km/h, the storm could cause extensive damage: winds and heavy rain battering flimsy houses, a storm surge that may push seawater 25km inland and the possibility of flooding in crowded cities. The cyclone is occurring during the Islamic holy month Ramadan, and reports from Muslim-majority Bangladesh said many villagers were fasting all day Tuesday, then eating at night before heading for the shelters early Wednesday. Iran reported a further 64 deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, bringing the total death toll in the Islamic republic to 7,183, with 2,735 people in a critical condition in hospital with the disease. In his daily update, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said 2,346 more people had tested positive for the virus since Tuesday. Iran has so far counted 126,949 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, of whom 98,808 people had recovered. Jahanpour said that 731,213 tests have so far been carried out in Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. New York faces enormous challenges in its attempts to implement one of the largest contact tracing schemes in the US, as the city prepares to reopen after nearly two months of coronavirus lockdown, writes Miranda Bryant for the Guardian US. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, has said the state is recruiting an “army of people to trace each person who tested positive” for an “unprecedented, nation-leading contact-tracing programme”. The New York city mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced a new test and trace corps, which he said would “lead the way in creating testing and tracing on a level we’ve never seen before in this city or this country”. Contact tracing is considered to be a key pillar of safely lifting stay-at-home orders, and involves asking Covid-19 patients to recall everyone they have had close contact with while they may have been infectious, and asking those people to quarantine themselves to help prevent the virus from spreading. In countries such as South Korea and Germany, early contact tracing has been credited with successfully minimising outbreaks. But as New York authorities roll out their plans to hire and train thousands of contact tracers, experts warn of the difficulties of pulling it off in the city of 8.6 million in which the pandemic has killed more than 20,000 people. Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, an anti-Asian sentiment has been on the rise – and now the fashion community is putting itself at the forefront in tackling the hate, writes Priya Elan, the Guardian’s deputy fashion editor. In the UK, racist incidents have rocketed and hate crimes have increased by 21%, while in the US, there has been an increase in racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans. “The upturn of violence and discrimination really hit way too close to home for all of us,” says the US designer Phillip Lim. “When we see people who look like us, our friends and family members, colleagues being attacked, we can’t be silent.” Lim’s 3.1 Phillip Lim label and Prabal Gurung are among the fashion brands contributing clothing, including T-shirts and hats, with proceeds going to the All Americans Movement, a campaign to help those from marginalised communities who have been affected by Covid-19. “It’s a cross-cultural movement, which reinforces the idea that there are many different ways to be American,” says Gurung, the Nepalese-American fashion designer who is based in New York. “It is an idea: a confluence of different cultures, communities and dreams. When different minority groups stand up and stand together, there is an astounding level of support that can change the tides for a more equitable and peaceful future.” Holidaymakers will be welcomed back to Spain “as soon as possible”, but only when safe to do so, the country’s foreign minister has said, PA Media reports. Foreign minister Arancha González Laya said cities with high concentrations of Covid-19 infection – such as Madrid and Barcelona – remain under stricter rules than more rural areas, but that the country will reopen to visitors at the earliest possible opportunity. González told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We are hoping to get tourists back as soon as possible but we are also conscious that, when we welcome them, we want to provide the safest destination in Europe. We want to make sure when they come they can continue to experience the amazing stay in Spain, whether they love sports or culture or cuisine or simply like our weather. But we want to make sure that at this moment, when every country is suffering from this pandemic, we can provide them with a safe and healthy experience – that’s top of our priorities right now. Lockdown measures in Spain have reflected its high numbers of casualties, with children confined indoors for six weeks between March and the end of April. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has passed 8,000 in Afghanistan, as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive for the second day straight and Kabul recorded its worst day of the crisis, writes Akhtar Mohammad Makoii for the Guardian in Herat. The health ministry confirmed 492 new cases out of 1,003 tests and 10 deaths from Covid-19 over past 24 hours, raising the total number of infections to 8,145 and death toll to 187. The ministry has pledged to increase number of daily tests. So far, 25,700 suspected patients have been tested. The country received 250 RNA extraction kits from the World Health Organization on Tuesday. Health officials asked the nation to avoid gathering for Eid, which is scheduled for the end of this week, and warned that the Eid gatherings will bring a surge in transmission as the country is yet to reach the peak of the pandemic. Kabul, the capital, recorded its worst day, after 262 of 522 tests came back positive. The city is the country’s worst-affected area by confirmed cases and, despite a government authorised lockdown, streets are still crowded. The northern province of Balkh exceeded Kabul in number of deaths, with three of the latest Covid-19 deaths reported in the province. Balkh has so far recorded 27 deaths and 622 cases. Four of the new deaths were reported in the eastern province of Nangarhar. The western province of Herat recorded 59 new confirmed cases. Afghanistan’s first case of Covid-19 was in Herat, when thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran, the scene of one of the earliest outbreaks outside China, in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. The total number of infections in Herat stands at 1,345, with 25 deaths. Parwan province recorded nine new coronavirus cases. At least seven people were killed in the province Tuesday night when “unknown” gunmen stormed a mosque. The northern Takhar province, which was also a battlefield last night, reported 28 new cases. At least nine members of local police force were killed and six were wounded in a clash with the Taliban in Takhar on Tuesday night. War is raging on with full intensity across the country as president Ashraf Ghani, in response to an attack on a maternity hospital in Kabul, ordered resumption of a full offensive against the Taliban and other militant groups. At least eight security forces were killed when Taliban fighters tried to overrun northern province of Kunduz Tuesday. According to the defence ministry more 40 Taliban fighters were also killed in the attack. The UN mission in Afghanistan asked asked warring sides on Tuesday to halt the fighting and to “respect humanitarian law”.

Thanks everyone, I’m signing off now and handing over to my colleague Damien Gayle. Thanks for reading and for your mails too. Open-air swimming pools in Germany are beginning to reopen from today, as virologists say they are confident the coronavirus will be killed off by chlorine levels in the water. Authorities in the western state of North-Rhine Westphalia have granted the 340 lidos in the region permission to open their doors from today as long as they abide by new hygiene rules that include an online-only booking system and a daily cap of visitors. In Berlin, swimming pools are set to open from 25 May, while other states will follow suit in June. “All existing findings indicate that the virus is certain to be killed off by chlorine”, the German Society for Bathing said in a statement. “Therefore there is no higher risk of infection in swimming pools than in other establishments”. “In indoor and outdoor swimming pools the virus will be killed off by the chlorine”, virologist Jürgen Rissland told regional broadcaster Saarländischer Rundfunk. The risk areas at lidos were therefore not in the water but the adjacent facilities. Berlin is therefore planning to open its outdoor swimming pools without showers and changing rooms, advising visitors to arrive at the pool in their swimwear. Further aiding Spain’s fight against the coronavirus is a new development in Seville: Beer Cart, a robotic arm trained to pull contactless pints. With lockdown measures being applied at a regional level in the country, some parts of Spain have moved to “phase one” of reopening. This includes the capability for bars and cafes to open at reduced capacity and with strict hygiene measures, ideal for robotic staff. Beer Cart has been employed at La Gitana Loca, a bar in Seville, where it has become a local sensation. The bar’s owner, Alberto Martinez, said he had bought the robot before the epidemic took hold, hoping mechanical manpower would increase sales. Because of the crisis, it was never put into use – although he realised it would be perfect in the new environment where people need to stay apart. “We thought it would be ideal for reopening in phase one,” he said. “As the aim is to avoid contact between customers and items (in the bar) … we realised the robot would be good using (disposable) plastic cups to serve beer, so it’s all very self-service.” Even so, the bar is far from making a profit, with only 12 customers allowed at one time on the outdoor terrace. “At the moment, it’s not profitable to open for the few seats we’re allowed. Now that we have to compete with other bars we have to do something different,” he said. “So (with the robot on show) people can see that the bar on the corner is open and that we’re doing something different.” The Spanish government has confirmed that the wearing of face masks will be compulsory from Thursday in enclosed areas and on the streets when the required 2-metre social distancing protocols cannot be followed. While children under six will be exempt from the order, masks are recommended for children aged three to five. People with breathing difficulties are also exempt from using masks. Fernando Simón, the head of Spain’s centre for health emergencies, said the measure was intended to protect both the wearer and those around them. He also said there were clear differences between going for a solitary walk in the countryside and navigating busy city streets. “The rules aren’t that complicated: you need to keep a distance from others of around 2 metres,” he said. “If logically, you’re on the street and realised that won’t be possible, you put on your mask and that’s that.” Until now, face masks – which are being handed out at train and metro stations – have been compulsory only on public transport. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, addressed MPs in congress on Wednesday morning to seek their approval for a fifth, two-week extension of the state-of-emergency that has been in force since 14 March. The prime minister apologised for the mistakes his Socialist-led coalition had made during the pandemic, but said the progress made over the past two months needed to be consolidated with another extension of one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns. “It is the people who have beaten the curve,” he said. “Spaniards have come together to stop the virus and no one has the right to squander what we’ve achieved with the lockdown.” His arguments were given short shrift by Pablo Casado, the leader of the conservative People’s party. “You’re trying to get us to choose between you and chaos, but that’s impossible because you are chaos,” said Casado. “You have no way of protecting the Spanish people except with this brutal confinement.” The total number of coronavirus cases in Russia, already the second highest in the world, has passed 300,000. 8,764 new novel coronavirus infections reported on Wednesday took the nationwide total to 308,705. The daily increase was the lowest since 1 May, however. Dr Melita Vujnovich, the WHO’s Russia representative, said she believed the situation in the country had entered a stabilisation phase, the Tass news agency cited her as saying. Only the US has reported more cases than Russia, though the Russian death rate remains much lower than many other countries, something that has been questioned by some critics and relatives of those who have died. Russia says the way it counts deaths is more accurate than others however and has defended its approach. The overall death toll edged up to 2,972 on Wednesday, with 135 new fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, the country’s coronavirus response centre said. Indonesia reported 693 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, its biggest daily rise and taking the total number of cases to 19,189, according to the website of Indonesia*s Covid-19 taskforce. There were 21 additional deaths reported, taking the total to 1,242, while 4,575 people have recovered. Indonesia reported its first case of Coronavirus on 2 March. The head of Uefa, European football’s governing body, has given an interview to the Guardian discussing the effect of Covid-19 on the sport. Among the highlights, he suggests live matches with fans will be back “very soon”. How would you describe the current situation and your feelings about it? There’s a lot of work still to be done. I was in Switzerland last week for the first time in two months and had meetings from 9am to 11pm. There is so much information [to take in] and so many calendar issues – and so many millions and millions, dozens of millions of dollars, that we will lose. It is then hard to fall asleep at night. You would be quite irresponsible if you could fall asleep immediately after a day like that. The situation for Uefa is not that alarming, we’re not in a dangerous situation, but we still care about the clubs and the leagues and the stakeholders so it is a lot of work. Would you bet a million dollars that Euro 2020 will be played in 2021? Yes, I would … I don’t know why it wouldn’t be. I don’t think that this virus will last for ever. I think it will [change] sooner than many think. What gives you that impression? It’s a serious situation but it is going down now and we are being more cautious. We know more about the virus and in general I’m an optimistic person. I don’t like this apocalyptic view that we have to wait for the second and third waves or even a fifth wave … people you know are likely to die one day, but do we have to be worried today? I don’t think so. We are ready and we will follow the recommendations of the authorities but I’m absolutely sure, personally, that good old football with fans will come back very soon. Police in the Philippines have raided an illegal hospital that had been secretly treating Chinese coronavirus patients. Two people were arrested and one patient was found during the raid on Tuesday at a residential villa that had been turned into a hospital with seven beds and its own chemists, authorities said. More than 200 suspected coronavirus rapid test kits and syringes were recovered from the villa, which was in the Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone on the site of a former American air base. At the entrance to the building was a small canteen with stacks of beer cases and a red sign welcoming visitors with well wishes in Chinese. The Chinese male patient was moved to a legal hospital. Those arrested were the Chinese administrator of the illegal hospital, which may have been operating secretly for about three months, and a compatriot who manned the drugstore. Police told the Associated Press that the patients were likely to have come from a large number of Chinese nationals working for online gambling companies in the area. The Philippines, backed by the Chinese government, has launched a crackdown on Chinese citizens who enter the country as tourists and then work for gambling operations, which are illegal in China. The patients are believed to have avoided visiting public hospitals for fear of being arrested. The Philippines has reported nearly 13,000 coronavirus infections, including 837 deaths, among the highest in south-east Asia. China will have to ‘rapidly activate domestic demand’, according to the country’s minister for industry, as the coronavirus cuts into global trade. The communist state has been for decades been the world’s factory, manufacturing much of its goods, but despite a recent rebound the effects of the pandemic has cut into China’s ability to sell. The Chinese minister for industry and information technology, Miao Wei told a news conference on Wednesday that “although our imports and exports in renminbi terms from January to April have increased moderately, I think that if the global pandemic cannot come under effective control, this is unsustainable”. To drive economic growth, the country will “rapidly activate domestic demand” to make up for weakness in the international markets, he said. China had already been trying to boost consumption as a key driver of domestic growth in a drive to recalibrate the economy from one driven by exports and state investment. The aerospace manufacturer Rolls-Royce is to cut at least 9,000 jobs from its global staff of 52,000, due to an anticipated fall in air travel following the coronavirus pandemic. The British company, which supplies engines for large aircraft such as the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350, said the job losses would predominantly affect its civil aerospace business, plus its central support functions. Air travel has slumped since March because of travel restrictions and future flight schedules may not return to their previous peak, hurting Rolls-Royce, which earns revenues from the number of hours its engines fly. The total number of Covid-19 cases worldwide has passed 4.9m, according to the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The latest figures show 4,900,253 global cases and 323,341 deaths. The US continues to show the most cases, with nearly a third of the global total at 1,528,566 and 91,921 deaths. The International Energy Agency has warned that countries must redouble their efforts to increase renewable energy supply as the world recovers from the coronavirus crisis. The agency predicts that renewables are set to see a drop in growth for the first time in two decades following the pandemic. While capacity within the power sector is expected to continue to grow, the use of renewables in transport will likely fall due to a drop in travel and the crash in the price of oil. The agency, which had expected 2020 to be a marquee year for green energy, cut its two-year forecast for growth in renewable capacity by nearly 10%t. “Putting emissions into a structural decline needed renewables to grow much faster across all sectors even before the Covid-19 crisis,” the IEA said in an updated forecast. “To regain and exceed the growth rates seen in the years before the pandemic, policymakers need to put clean energy – including renewables and energy efficiency – at the centre of recovery efforts.” Revising downwards a prediction made in October, the IEA now expects 167GW of renewable capacity to become operational this year – a decline of 13% from 2019 and the first downward trend since 2000. However, this will still add 6% to the global renewable capacity total this year – more than the combined size of power systems in both North America and Europe – with solar and wind accounting for the vast majority of new installations. Hallo there, this is Paul MacInnes and I’m taking over from Helen for the next four hours. Any questions or tips feel free to email me: paul.macinnes@theguardian.com That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thank you for following along – and, always, to those of you who reached out on Twitter and via email. Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: Global confirmed cases near 4.9 million. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 323,286 people are known to have died from Covid-19 while at least 4,897,567 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting. Trump says the US having the highest cases worldwide is a ‘badge of honour’. The US president told reporters at a cabinet meeting that the high number of cases in the US – far higher than any other country – is a “badge of honour”, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: “You know when you say that we lead in cases, that’s because we have more testing than anybody else.” He said he looks at the number “in a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.” Singapore sentences man to death via Zoom call. A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state’s first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely.Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try to curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia. UN chief praises Africa’s efforts to stem virus. UN secretary general António Guterres said on Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared with over 320,000 deaths worldwide. Brazil confirms record daily rise in deaths and cases. Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full. Covid-19 crisis will push 60m into poverty says World Bank chief. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said. David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%. US president claims hydroxychloroquine study is ‘Trump enemy statement’. Trump claimed a recent US study indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a “Trump enemy statement”. “If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,” Trump said. “They were very old. Almost dead. It was a Trump enemy statement.” There have only been limited studies on the drug in relation to Covid-19 so far. New Zealand PM flags four-day working week. New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers to consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues. High schools open in South Korea. South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time since the pandemic began, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. China gears up for annual congress. China’s biggest political event of the year opens Friday after months of delay over coronavirus fears, with President Xi Jinping determined to project strength and control over the outbreak despite international criticism and a wounded economy. WHO assembly passes a resolution to investigate global pandemic response. Member states have backed a resolution strongly supportive of the World Health Organization, after Donald Trump issued a fresh broadside against the UN body, giving it 30 days to make unspecified reforms or lose out on US funding. None of the WHO’s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries. The resolution backs the WHO’s leadership and said there needed to be an investigation into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic. Public trust in the travel industry has plunged to an all-time low as airlines and holiday companies continue to deny and delay refunds for coronavirus cancellations, in breach of the law, according to new research from a UK consumer group. The latest consumer insight tracker from Which? reveals that trust in airlines and holiday companies has slumped from a net score of nine in February 2020 to -12 in May 2020, a fall of 21 points and the lowest in the seven years of collecting the data. Global report: Brazil’s deadliest day as Trump calls US cases a ‘badge of honour’ Brazil has seen its most deadly day since the coronavirus outbreak began, prompting Donald Trump to consider a ban on travel to the US from Brazil as he declared the huge number of US cases of coronavirus was “a badge of honour”. After a cabinet meeting on Tuesday at the White House, Trump said: “I don’t want people coming over here and infecting our people. I don’t want people over there sick either,” in relation to Brazil. When asked if about the possibility of a travel ban, the president said he was considering it and went on to say he saw the large number of US cases as a “badge of honour”. The US has by far the highest number of cases in the world, at more than 1.5 million with nearly 92,000 deaths, followed by Russia and then Brazil, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. The death toll in Brazil reached a total of 17,971 on Tuesday, after a record 1,179 people died in one day. The highest daily toll before Tuesday had been 881 deaths, on 12 May. More than 85% of intensive care beds are full in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state’s first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely. Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try to curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia. “For the safety of all involved in the proceedings, the hearing for Public Prosecutor v Punithan A/L Genasan was conducted by video-conferencing,” a spokesperson for Singapore’s supreme court said in response to Reuters’ questions, citing restrictions imposed to minimise virus spread. It was the first criminal case where a death sentence has been pronounced by remote hearing in Singapore, the spokesperson added. Genasan’s lawyer, Peter Fernando, said his client received the judge’s verdict on a Zoom call and is considering an appeal. The global growth of renewable energy will slow for the first time in 20 years due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which will “hurt but not halt” the rise of clean energy. The world’s energy watchdog has warned that developers will build fewer wind farms and solar energy projects this year compared with a record roll out of renewables in 2019. But a rebound is possible in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), if critical government decisions made within the next few months support a green economic recovery from the pandemic. New figures from the IEA predict that the world will grow its capacity of renewable energy by 6% or 167 GW this year. The forecast growth is 13% less than the amount of new capacity which started up in 2019. The slowdown is likely to be more severe in Europe. The IEA expects the amount of new renewable energy rolling out this year to fall by a third to its lowest annual growth rate since 1996. Contact tracers lack knowledge about Covid-19 job They were hailed as stepping up to serve their country, with all the “rigorous” and “detailed” instruction needed for such an important role – but a programme to train thousands of contact-tracers to help control the spread of coronavirus has been described as shambolic and inadequate by recruits. People hired to contact those exposed to someone with Covid-19 and advise them to self-isolate have reported spending days just trying to log into the online system, and virtual training sessions that left participants unclear about their roles. New contact tracers have been told to rely on a two-page script and a list of frequently asked questions, both seen by the Guardian. When one taking part in a training session, run by contact centre company Sitel, asked for guidance on how to speak with somebody whose loved one had died of coronavirus, they were reportedly told to look at YouTube videos on the topic. UK plans for contact-tracing in doubt as app not ready until June The Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh, Frances Perraudin, Heather Stewart and Peter Walker report: Plans to introduce coronavirus tracing have been hit by fresh uncertainty as it emerged that a mobile tracking app will not be ready until June. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said last week that the app would be “rolling out in mid May” across England, but on Tuesday ministerial sources tried to downplay a system considered critical to control the disease as the country emerges from lockdown. It came as the deputy chief scientific adviser acknowledged the decision to abandon track-and-trace in March was made because of a lack of testing capacity, but said it was “the right thing to do” in the circumstances. Prof Angela McLean told the No 10 press briefing: “The advice that we gave certainly took account of what testing was available. It was what was the best thing to do with the tests that we had. We could not have people in hospital with Covid symptoms not knowing whether or not they had Covid.” Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Lebanon is suffering its worst economic crisis in decades, as well as a coronavirus lockdown. Some Lebanese families have started paying their home help in the depreciating local currency, while others are now unable to pay them at all, with increasing reports of domestic workers being thrown into the street, AFP reports. Lebanon is to start repatriation flights from its closed airport on Wednesday, at first for Ethiopians and mostly male migrants from Egypt. Outside the Ethiopian consulate in Beirut on Monday, dozens of Ethiopian women and Lebanese employers tried to secure seats on Wednesday’s flight. But Lebanese security forces turned them away at the door, telling them to return in nine days and employers that they would have to pay for the flight. An estimated 250,000 domestic workers live in Lebanon, the large majority Ethiopian, many in conditions condemned by rights groups. A sponsorship system known as “kafala” excludes maids, nannies and carers from Lebanon’s labour law, and leaves them at the mercy of their employers, who pay wages as low as $150 a month. With staff obtained at high fees from recruitment agencies even before being paid wages, and unhappy workers unable to resign without their employer’s permission, some have likened the system to slavery. Activists say calls for help have increased in recent weeks, especially as live-in workers have been in lockdown with families. Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: Global confirmed cases near 4.9 million. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 323,286 people are known to have died while at least 4,897,567 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting. Donald Trump claimed scientists carried out hydroxychloroquine study because they oppose him politically. The study of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed that those who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while those who did not had an 11.4% death rate. Trump said: “That was a false study done. Where they gave it very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die. It was given by obviously not friends of the administration” . Trump also said the US having the highest cases worldwide is a ‘badge of honour’. The US President told reporters at a cabinet meeting that the high number of cases in the US – far higher than any other country – is a “badge of honour”, because it means the US is testing the most.Trump told reporters: “You know when you say that we lead in cases, that’s because we have more testing than anybody else.”He said he looks at the number “in a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.” UN chief praises Africa’s efforts to stem virus. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared to over 320,000 deaths worldwide. Brazil confirms record daily rise in deaths and cases. Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country now has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full. Covid-19 crisis will push 60m into poverty says World Bank chief. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said.In the latest apocalyptic prediction by a member of the global financial elite, David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%. Jacinda Ardern flags four-day working week as way to rebuild country. New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers to consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues.In a Facebook live video Ardern said people had suggested everything from the shorter work week to more public holidays as a means to stimulate the economy and encourage domestic tourism, while the borders remain closed to foreign nationals. High schools open in South Korea. South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time this year, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. China gears up for annual congress. China’s biggest political event of the year opens Friday after months of delay over coronavirus fears, with President Xi Jinping determined to project strength and control over the outbreak despite international criticism and a wounded economy, AFP reports. The World Health Organization annual assembly passes a resolution to investigate global response to the pandemic. None of the WHO’s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries. First UAE flight to Israel, with virus aid for Palestinians. The United Arab Emirates flew its first publicly announced flight to Israel on Tuesday when Etihad Airways sent medical supplies to help the Palestinians cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Except for Jordan and Egypt, Arab countries have no official relations with Israel but Gulf Arab nations like the UAE and the Jewish state have been warming ties recently amid shared concern over Iran. California’s undocumented relief fund sees chaotic start. Last month, California made headlines when it announced a first-in-the-nation plan to create a $125m coronavirus relief fund for undocumented workers. But its rollout got off to a chaotic start this week, with thousands of calls flooding phone lines, creating huge delays, and so many visitors to the official website that it crashed for hours. South Africa eased its lockdown measures, resume classes for some pupils on 1 June.Those in grades seven and 12, usually aged 13 and 18, will return to class and the country’s minister of basic education Angie Motshekga said that, under strict social distancing rules, other grades would be able to attend lessons in schools with fewer than 150 pupils. Larger schools will open for other grades at a later date. The Netherlands will press ahead with a further easing of lockdown measures in June due to a steadily declining number of infections and hospital admissions, its prime minister Mark Rutte has said.The country’s 17 million inhabitants have been living under the lockdown measures for about two and a half months. Rishi Sunak, the UK’s chancellor, said the country is facing “a severe recession the likes of which we haven’t seen”. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year. Cambridge University will not hold traditional lectures in the 2020/21 academic year.There will be no “face-to-face lectures” at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said. Lectures will continue virtually, while it may be possible for smaller teaching groups to take place in person if it conforms to social distancing requirements. Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in infections as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive. The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country’s worst day of the crisis – the previous high was 414. The border between Canada and the US will remain closed to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month. China’s biggest political event of the year opens Friday after months of delay over coronavirus fears, with President Xi Jinping determined to project strength and control over the outbreak despite international criticism and a wounded economy, AFP reports. The 3,000 members of the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s legislature, will gather in Beijing this week. The annual gatherings have been occasions for the Communist Party to tout its achievements, set the country’s economic agenda and consolidate Xi’s power. But this year’s congress comes on the back of the biggest challenge of Xi’s political life, with a virus that has killed thousands of people, paralysed the world’s second-biggest economy and sparked a bout of online criticism of the government. The Communist Party put off the “Two Sessions”, originally scheduled for March, for the first time since the Cultural Revolution as the country battled the coronavirus, which surfaced in the central city of Wuhan late last year. Since then, China’s official case numbers have dwindled even as millions were infected abroad, with Beijing now positioning itself as a success story and potential saviour for the world, offering billions of dollars in aid to fight the virus. But the atmosphere will continue to be “solemn and tense” amid fears of new infections, Gu Su, a professor of law and philosophy at Nanjing University, said. The congress is expected to span seven days this year instead of the usual two weeks, state media reported. Lights, camera, no action: Thai films banned from shooting love scenes during Covid-19 Thailand’s film industry has been instructed not to shoot any love scenes, fighting or acts that involve close contact, to avoid the spread of the coronavirus. As officials continued to relax lockdown measures across Thailand, production companies were told to adapt their work to comply with social distancing rules. Under guidance issued by Yupha Thawiwattanakit Bowon, deputy permanent secretary of culture, filmmakers must work in well-ventilated spaces, with no more than 50 crew members present. Special effects and camera angles can be used to help depict scenes that would usually require intimacy or contact, and all people off-camera must wear a mask. The US President told reporters at a cabinet meeting that the high number of cases in the US – far higher than any other country – is a “badge of honour”, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: “You know when you say that we lead in cases, that’s because we have more testing than anybody else.” He said he looks at the number “in a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.” The US has 1,527,895 cases. The country with the next-highest number of cases is Russia, with 299,941. Trump added: “So I view it as a badge of honour. Really, it’s a badge of honour. It’s a great tribute to the testing and all of the work that a lot of professionals have done.” The US also has the highest number of deaths worldwide, with 91,921. The next worst official death toll, in the UK, is 35,422, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The US testing rates are high, but not the highest worldwide. Its total tests per 1,000 people are the fourteenth-highest worldwide, according to Our World in Data. Sweden has taken a soft approach to virus restrictions and although its rules are likely to be in place longer than in other countries, officials are adamant their strategy is a winner in the long term, AFP reports. “This fight against Covid-19 is a marathon,” Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said recently, adding that his officials “strongly believe” their measures are viable for the long haul. While people in other European countries have gradually begun returning to their workplaces in recent weeks, Swedes have been strongly advised to continue working from home, and possibly not just for weeks, but for months to come. However, Sweden never imposed full lockdown measures – under-16s have continued to go to school, patrons have not been stopped from going to cafes, bars and restaurants. Sweden has 30,799 confirmed cases and a death toll of 3,743. Some have accused Sweden of playing Russian roulette with citizens’ lives by allowing the virus to circulate slowly in society, with the main goal being to ensure the public healthcare system can keep pace. The consequences are difficult to miss - Sweden’s death rate stood at 371 per million inhabitants on Tuesday, roughly eight times the rate in Norway and Finland, according to the Worldometer website. However, although Sweden’s hospitals have reported strained conditions, they have not been overwhelmed. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 797 to 176,007, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Wednesday. The reported death toll rose by 83 to 8,090, the tally showed. Australians in the country’s most populous state will be able to vacation within its borders next month, when art galleries and museums will also reopen, as officials seek to boost an economy hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The move will allow New South Wales state, home to Sydney, to open up tourist regions on its southern coast that were badly damaged by huge bushfires before the virus wreaked further havoc. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said people would still need to adapt to a “new normal” as officials maintain some of the social distancing measures that have been credited with keeping both Covid-19 cases and deaths relatively low. Australia has reported just over 7,000 infections, including 100 deaths, among its population of 25 million. NSW, the hardest hit state, logged just four new cases over the past 24 hours, all international travellers already in quarantine. More than 7,000 test results over the same period showed no community transmission, Berejiklian said. There are almost 4.9 million cases of coronavirus globally, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, with 4,897,492 currently confirmed. The current number of deaths is 323,285. Both cases and deaths are likely to be higher due to differing testing rates and underreporting. The 15 worst-affected countries in terms of cases are: US: 1,527,895 Russia: 299,941 Brazil: 271,885 United Kingdom: 250,138 Spain: 232,037 Italy: 226,699 France: 180,933 Germany: 177,778 Turkey: 151,615 Iran: 124,603 India: 106,475 Peru: 99,483 China: 84,063 Canada: 80,493 Saudi Arabia: 59,854 Venezuela imposed new curfews in a handful of towns along its borders with Colombia and Brazil in response to a jump in coronavirus cases which officials attributed mainly to returning migrants, Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said on Tuesday. In a state television address, Rodriguez said the South American country had detected 131 new cases in the past 24 hours, the most it has registered in a single day to date. He said that included 110 people who had contracted the virus abroad, bringing the total to 749, with 10 deaths. Millions of Venezuelans have emigrated in recent years due to an economic breakdown and humanitarian crisis, with many settling in nearby Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. But with lockdowns to contain the spread of the coronavirus in those countries now hurting their economies, thousands have returned. Migrants returning to Venezuela are required to spend a 14-day quarantine period at shelters at the border, rather than in their home states. Venezuela has so far registered far fewer coronavirus cases than most major Latin American countries, but the daily case count has grown at a brisk rate in each of the last four days. Hospital workers warn that their facilities are unprepared for a major outbreak after years of underfunding South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time this year, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, Reuters reports. The beginning of the spring semester has been postponed several times since March as South Korea battled the first large coronavirus outbreak outside China, with classes held online. But with daily coronavirus cases sharply down since a February peak, teachers with thermometers and hand sanitisers welcomed seniors in masks at their high schools on Wednesday. Under new health guidelines for schools, students and teachers must wear masks except at mealtimes, and are asked to wipe down their desks. Windows will be open to improve air-flow, and desks spaced 1 metre (3 feet) apart. Starting with high school seniors, schools will reopen in stages between 20 May and 1 June for all 5.5 million elementary, middle and high school students. Share your experiences: how do you think New Zealand should change after Covid-19? A week into New Zealand’s loosened lockdown laws and the country is beginning to return to a semblance of normality. Office workers are up early heading out for their commute in smart clothes, while children are lugging around schoolbags full of homework, and hairdressers are heaving with colours, cuts and trims. Has anything changed, and what changes should stick? During lockdown it seemed that New Zealand would collapse and be rebuilt after the pandemic. Many workers found they were unexpectedly productive at home, and relished ditching the expensive and climate-destroying commute, while many children enjoyed learning in less structured ways. Many families spent more time together, dogs were walked excessively, and home-cooking become the latest fashion. Get in touch on the form here: New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers to consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues. In a Facebook live video Ardern said people had suggested everything from the shorter work week to more public holidays as a means to stimulate the economy and encourage domestic tourism, while the borders remain closed to foreign nationals. The prime minister’s informal comments have excited New Zealanders, many of whom are questioning whether seismic, systemic change will result from the pandemic – or whether life will return to normal; with its associated problems. Speaking from Rotorua, one of the country’s tourist hubs, Ardern said many New Zealanders said they would travel more domestically if they had more flexibility in their working lives. The country’s tourism market has taken a massive downturn after the pandemic, with all borders remaining closed to foreign nationals and many New Zealanders taking pay-cuts or tightening their belt in case of lay-offs. “I hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day workweek. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees. But as I’ve said there’s just so much we’ve learnt about Covid and that flexibility of people working from home, the productivity that can be driven out of that,” Ardern said. The United Arab Emirates flew its first publicly announced flight to Israel on Tuesday when Etihad Airways sent medical supplies to help the Palestinians cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Except for Jordan and Egypt, Arab countries have no official relations with Israel but Gulf Arab nations like the UAE and the Jewish state have been warming ties recently amid shared concern over Iran. “Etihad Airways operated a dedicated humanitarian cargo flight from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv on 19 May to provide medical supplies to the Palestinians,” an Etihad spokesperson said. “The flight had no passengers on board.” The official UAE news agency WAM said the flight involved the delivery of 14 tonnes of urgent medical supplies that “will support the efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and its impact in the occupied Palestinian territory”. Israel controls access to the Palestinian territories. The Etihad delivery was described as part of broader humanitarian efforts. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. “Covid-19 has made much slower progress [in Africa] than the predictions that were made at the beginning” of the crisis, Guterres said in an interview with RFL radio in France. This has been largely thanks to the fact that “most African governments and organisations took in time very brave prevention measures which provide a lesson for some developed nations that did not,” he added. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared to over 320,000 deaths worldwide. Podcast: The scientific race to understand Covid-19 In the five months since the world learned about Covid-19, it has killed hundreds of thousands of people. In that time, what have scientists found out – and what do they still not know? Coronavirus cases and deaths over time: how countries compare around the world The Guardian’s Nick Evershed and Trent Nixon have created handy this handy set of epidemic curves for most countries, based on data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and compiled by Our World in Data. It shows, approximately, which countries have managed to suppress the virus, which countries are only now being hit badly, and which countries are experiencing a second wave of infections: Last month, California made headlines when it announced a first-in-the-nation plan to create a $125m coronavirus relief fund for undocumented workers. But its rollout got off to a chaotic start this week, with thousands of calls flooding phone lines, creating huge delays, and so many visitors to the official website that it crashed for hours. Adding to already overwhelmed telephone systems, the state issued last-minute directives that said callers needed to reach a live person in order to apply for aid. Nonprofits across the state selected to distribute the money reported huge demand as people rushed to secure a spot for the first-come, first-served program. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, or Chirla, one of 12 nonprofits tapped by the state to distribute the funds, received more than 1.1m phone calls on day one of the program – 630,000 calls just within the first 90 minutes of opening the hotline. Rare UK wildlife thriving in lockdown, reveals UK’s National Trust First came the goats. During the first days of lockdown the bearded, ghostly white creatures wandered down from their north Wales clifftop home into the town of Llandudno and made headlines around the globe. Now the National Trust is reporting that emboldened wildlife, from raptors and warblers to badgers, otters and even orcas, appear to be enjoying the disappearance of humans from its gardens, castles and waterways across the UK. The charity is asking people to be aware that when they eventually return to the countryside they should take care not to disturb wildlife they would not usually expect to encounter. Reports from rangers and gardeners include peregrine falcons nesting in the ancient ruins of Corfe Castle in Dorset, English partridges rootling around an empty car park near Cambridge, and a cuckoo calling at Osterley Park in west London, having not been heard there for 20 years. ‘We do not feel safe’: Samoan seafarers plead for right to return home Lagipoiva Cherelle Jackson reports for the Guardian: Samoans trapped at sea due to coronavirus have pleaded with their government to allow them to return home. The 321 Samoan seafarers working on commercial and cruise ships around the world have been told by their government to be patient, since Samoa closed its borders in March to all travellers including returning citizens. Thirty-five of the seafarers whose contracts ended at the beginning of the pandemic are concerned for their families as their sources of income have stopped. Twelve of them are stranded on MSC Armonia, a cruise ship moored off the coast of the Bahamas. Jorge Contesse, law professor and director of the Center for Transnational Law, Rutgers University said the seafarers had the right to return to their home country and were protected under the 2006 maritime labour convention (MLC). “Under this convention seafarers are entitled to be repatriated at no cost to themselves.” Samoa ratified the convention in 2013. Contesse said: “Samoa has a duty to protect its citizens and therefore it should activate diplomatic communications and legal proceedings if necessary.” The Pan-American Health Organization said Tuesday that Nicaragua’s government has denied its personnel access to the nation’s hospitals despite having offered access, a move adding to the widespread belief President Daniel Ortega is trying to underplay the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, AP reports. Up to this week, Nicaragua had reported only 25 confirmed Covid-19 cases and eight related deaths. Those numbers became more difficult to defend as more Nicaraguans spoke out about the deaths of their relatives and reports mounted of near-clandestine burials. On Tuesday, Nicaragua’s Health Ministry suddenly increased the case count tenfold, to 254, and said the number of deaths had grown to 17. But there is evidence suggesting that might still be a vast under-count. Victims’ relatives claim that some cases are simply listed as atypical pneumonia or respiratory failure. On Monday, Ortega acknowledged that some of the 309 cases of people who have died of pneumonia since January might have involved Covid-19. Interestingly, on May 3 the health ministry had reported only 86 pneumonia deaths so far this year, suggesting there were 223 such deaths between 3 May and 15 May. Ortega’s government has not implemented social distancing measures used elsewhere and continues to promote mass gatherings. Schools remain open and professional sporting events still draw fans. A registry of death certificates in Mexico City suggests there were 4,577 cases where doctors mentioned coronavirus or Covid-19 as a possible or probable cause of death, more than three times the official death toll in the city, AP reports. The federal government acknowledges only 1,332 confirmed deaths in Mexico City since the pandemic began, less than a third as many as the investigation revealed. The anti-corruption group Mexicans Against Corruption said in a report Monday that it got access to a database of death certificates issued in Mexico City between 18 March and 12 May. It showed that in explanatory notes attached to 4,577 death certificates, doctors included the words SARS, COV2, COV, Covid 19, or new coronavirus. The virus’ technical name is SARS-CoV-2. The notes the group counted included terms like suspected, “probable, or possible role of the virus in the deaths. In 3,209 of the certificates, it was listed as a suspected contributing factor along with other causes of death, like pneumonia, respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure. Only 323 certificates list confirmed coronavirus as a cause of death; 1,045 other death certificates listed Covid-19 but didn’t specify if it was suspected or confirmed. The group did not say how it accessed the database, which was kept by local courts. But it noted that official counts showed only 1,060 coronavirus deaths during that 18 March-12 May period. Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has acknowledged there are more deaths than have officially been reported, and has said a special team of epidemiologists will review the death figures. US births continued to fall last year, leading to the fewest number of newborns in 35 years, AP reports. The decline is the latest sign of a prolonged national baby bust that’s been going on for more than a decade. And some experts believe the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the economy will suppress the numbers further. Experts say there are a number of causes, but chief among them are shifting attitudes about motherhood: Many women and couples delay childbearing and have fewer kids once they start. The economy is a factor, because many jobs are low-paying and unstable, and that coupled with high rents and other factors have caused women and couples to be much more cautious about having kids, said John Santelli, a Columbia University professor of population and family health. Santelli said it’s possible births will go up this year, at least among some groups. Access to birth control and abortion has become more difficult, and some homebound couples may find themselves with greater opportunity to conceive, he said. But others say it’s more likely births will plummet. The idea that there will be a lot of coronababies is widely is widely perceived as a myth, said Hans-Peter Kohler, a University of Pennsylvania fertility researcher. The debate most demographers are having is not about whether there will be a decline, but whether it will be lasting, he said. The decline due to Covid-19 might be different given the extent and severity of the crisis, and the long-lasting uncertainty that is caused by it, Kohler wrote in an email. Video: The US president has defended his use of the anti-malaria drug, dismissing a study indicating it was not an effective coronavirus treatment as a ‘Trump enemy statement’. He also attacked Nancy Pelosi after she publicly expressed concern, claiming she had ‘mental problems’: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says that his interim health minister will on Wednesday sign a new chloroquine protocol, Reuters reports. Bolsonaro said his own mother is 93 and he keeps a box of chloroquine in case she needs it. He also said that he saw Trump say he was taking chloroquine. Interim health minister General Eduardo Pazuello would stay on for the time being, Bolsonaro said. Last week, my colleague Dom Phillips reported, Brazil’s health minister abruptly resigned after less than a month on the job. Teich was Brazil’s second health minister to leave office in less than a month. In the weeks leading up to the resignation Teich had increasingly disagreed with Bolsonaro over social isolation and the use of the malaria drug chloroquine to treat coronavirus. The Brazilian president has enthusiastically backed using the drug, despite a string of medical studies showing that it has no positive effect on people suffering Covid-19, and can possibly cause other health complications. More on the resignation last week below: In case you missed it: beyond the hot spots of Brazil and Mexico, the coronavirus is threatening to overwhelm Latin American cities large and small in an alarming sign that the pandemic may be only at the start of its destructive march through the region. More than 90% of intensive care beds were full last week in Chile’s capital, Santiago, whose main cemetery dug 1,000 emergency graves to prepare for a wave of deaths, AP reports. In Lima, Peru, patients took up 80% of intensive care beds as of Friday. Peru has the world’s 12th-highest number of confirmed cases, with more than 90,000.“Were in bad shape,” said Pilar Mazzetti, head of the Peruvian governments Covid-19 task force. “This is war.” In some cities, doctors say patients are dying because of a lack of ventilators or because they couldn’t get to a hospital fast enough. With intensive care units swamped, officials plan to move patients from capitals like Lima and Santiago to hospitals in smaller cities that aren’t as busy running the risk of spreading the disease further. A month after swamping the Ecuadorian coastal city of Guayaquil in one of the first serious blows to Latin America, Covid-19 is sickening thousands in the capital of Quito, where 80% of intensive care beds were occupied as of Friday. In terms of intensive care, we’re stripped bare,” city health secretary Lenín Mantilla said. In Mexico, intensive care occupancy is below 50% in most cities, although deaths have begun to overwhelm funeral homes and crematoriums in the Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said.In the latest apocalyptic prediction by a member of the global financial elite, David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%. Malpass said that the World Bank group had so far loaned money for emergency programmes in 100 countries, accounting for about 70% of the world’s population, in response to the crisis. He said the money would “reinforce healthcare systems” as well as pay for medical equipment and supplies.According to a transcript of his speech on the World Bank website, he said: The health and economic impacts that the Covid-19 pandemic and shut down have inflicted on developing countries are severe. Our estimate is that up to 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty – that erases all the progress made in poverty alleviation in the past three years. And our forecasts indicate deep recession this year as much as minus five percent recession for the global economy. Families have lost loved ones, millions of jobs and livelihoods are lost, the health systems are under enormous strain worldwide. In the UK, thousands of people with cancer could die early because so many hospitals have suspended surgery for the disease while the NHS battles the coronavirus, experts warn today. The pandemic will have “a terrible indirect impact on the lives of cancer patients” for months to come, on top of the devastation for families who have lost a loved one to Covid-19, according to research by the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR). The authors say that the disruption to NHS cancer treatment, and especially delays to operations to remove tumours, will lead directly to some people’s disease having become incurable. Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country now has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. This week Brazil overtook the United Kingdom to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections, amid warnings from its former health minister that three painful months lie ahead. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full. Brazil accounts for more cases than any other country in Latin America, which has seen 480,000-plus cases and 31,000 dead. Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has snubbed physical distancing rules and has called for gyms, hair salons and other businesses to reopen. Hello and welcome to today’s global live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I’m Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the latest news from around the world for the next few hours.

The World Bank estimates that 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty, World Bank chief David Malpass said in a speech, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%. Meanwhile Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country now has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Global confirmed death toll passes 322,000. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 322,457 people are known to have died while at least 4,881,619 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began.The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting. Donald Trump claimed scientists carried out hydroxychloroquine study because they oppose him politically. The study of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed that those who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while those who did not had an 11.4% death rate. Trump said: “That was a false study done. Where they gave it very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die. It was given by obviously not friends of the administration” . The Covid-19 crisis could push 60 million people into poverty, the head of the World Bank, David Malpass, said. Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world’s population. The World Health Organization’s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic. None of the WHO’s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries. South Africa eased its lockdown measures, resume classes for some pupils on 1 June.Those in grades seven and 12, usually aged 13 and 18, will return to class and the country’s minister of basic education Angie Motshekga said that, under strict social distancing rules, other grades would be able to attend lessons in schools with fewer than 150 pupils. Larger schools will open for other grades at a later date. The Netherlands will press ahead with a further easing of lockdown measures in June due to a steadily declining number of infections and hospital admissions, its prime minister Mark Rutte has said.The country’s 17 million inhabitants have been living under the lockdown measures for about two and a half months. Rishi Sunak, the UK’s chancellor, said the country is facing “a severe recession the likes of which we haven’t seen”. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year. Cambridge University will not hold traditional lectures in the 2020/21 academic year.There will be no “face-to-face lectures” at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said. Lectures will continue virtually, while it may be possible for smaller teaching groups to take place in person if it conforms to social distancing requirements. Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in infections as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive. The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country’s worst day of the crisis – the previous high was 414. The border between Canada and the US will remain closed to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month. Spain reported a death toll below 100 for the third consecutive day, confirming 83 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country. The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam’s third holiest site, will reopen next week, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March. People living within a kilometre of Barcelona’s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday, as the local lockdown eases. People will be able to make “recreational use” of the Catalan capital’s beaches as long as they respect physical distancing. Half a dozen people from three English Premier League football clubs tested positive for Covid-19 in the space of two days, dealing a blow to hopes of top-flight English football resuming next month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/20/solar-power-in-crisis-panels-generate-power-government-subsidy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-20T17:45:12Z","webTitle":"Solar power in crisis: 'My panels generate enough power for two loads of washing'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/20/solar-power-in-crisis-panels-generate-power-government-subsidy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/20/solar-power-in-crisis-panels-generate-power-government-subsidy","fields":{"headline":"Solar power in crisis: 'My panels generate enough power for two loads of washing'","bodyText":"Sit back, relax, and read this story with an untroubled conscience: it has been created on a laptop and mobile phone powered entirely by the rays of the sun. This feat would surely astound the most idealistic Greek philosopher or Victorian entrepreneur. It would confirm their wildest hopes for humanity’s progress. Perhaps they would be even more amazed that it was possible via a coalition of Chinese companies, British roofers and local councils. Oh, and government support, which is set to be abruptly withdrawn. The power comes from 16 black Ja solar panels that were fitted to the roof of my home in August. Together, these panels, each the size of a coffee tabletop, have a capacity of 4kW, enough to meet the energy needs of an average family home. Today, a gloomy autumnal moment, they have generated 4.403kWh. It hardly sounds impressive – it’s enough power for a couple of loads of washing – but collectively it represents a revolution. Solar hasn’t changed my life, but it has shifted my perceptions. A little monitor on my desk tells me how much electricity I am generating. I’m acutely aware of the scarcity of energy, the rarity of unbroken sunshine and changing path of the sun. In August, rays hit my panels at 8.30am and an image of a green finger materialised on my monitor, urging me to switch on appliances. Now it doesn’t appear until 10.30am and so we delay putting on the washing machine. We have toddlers around the house all day, so solar suits us: we time the dishwasher for daylight hours and the TV tends to be on more during the day than at night. If I’m working from home, I charge laptops and phones around midday, too. Solar’s drawback is that most power is generated in daylight hours, when people tend to be at work, and there’s currently no affordable battery technology to store the energy you generate. But that energy is not wasted: it goes into the national grid, and solar owners are paid for what they produce. A million British homes now have rooftop solar panels. The thicker panels are solar thermal and heat water. Most, some 750,000 solar PV installations, convert the sun into electricity. Solar produces 1.5% of total UK electricity, up from virtually nothing in 2010. It has proved so popular that the government wants to cut the feed-in tariff, the solar subsidy, by 87%. Since 2010, domestic and commercial solar systems have been paid by the government for every kWh they generate. I receive quarterly payments for the electricity I generate at 12.96p per kWh with another smaller payment for what the authorities estimate I return to the grid. These payments are guaranteed for 20 years. Such has been the popularity of solar that the government says it is spending too much money supporting it: from January, it is proposing to dramatically slash this subsidy for new solar installations. The Solar Trade Association has warned this could cost up to 27,000 jobs; 1,000 are already disappearing with the recent closure of four big renewable companies. Will this solar miracle be shattered? Will rooftop panels soon resemble the relics of a bygone energy age, like the enormous cooling towers of coal-fired power stations? Like many people, I was persuaded to put up solar PV not by promises of a fat cheque from the government but by meeting someone who’d had panels fitted and sung their praises. In 2014, I was researching a story about REPOWERBalcombe, a community energy group created by members of the Sussex village best known for its anti-fracking protests. Tom Parker, a gardener, had panels fitted on his roof five years earlier and then volunteered to help 15 renewable projects in the neighbourhood, including his children’s school. He had watched solar systems over 20 years’ worth of running time – and none had lost a single hour of power generation. “It’s fantastically reliable, much more reliable than the National Grid,” he enthused. “It’s just churning out energy, year after year.” Last year, I moved to a south-facing house and this summer found a good deal for solar PV: my standard 16 panels cost £4,630 to supply and install, which was done in a day in August by an electrician and two roofers who were recent converts to solar employment. Business was brisk: they were supposed to fit two roofs each day. Business is even brisker now. Britain’s solar providers are swamped with work as people rush to get panels installed before the government introduces its planned subsidy cut. After that, with solar still a few years off “grid parity” – where a unit of solar power is as cheap as electricity produced via gas, coal or other fossil fuels – the industry will rapidly burn out. According to the Solar Trade Association, the proposed cuts will leave Britain with an annual solar spend of less than what Buckinghamshire county council is devoting to potholes this year. I claim I would have fitted the panels without a subsidy because I want to reduce my dependence on fossil fuels; for others, solar PV is a pragmatic investment: at current prices, government subsidies and reduced electricity bills return your £5,000 in about eight years; then the subsidy – and lower bills – keep coming for the 20-year lifespan of the panels. Most experts say the panels will last longer. I have not yet noticed a rapid drop in my electricity bill, but reductions in southern England are estimated at £135 a year. If I was truly principled, perhaps I wouldn’t pocket the subsidy, but a solar meter was installed next to my electricity meter and I registered for the feed-in tariff through my energy provider. When the feed-in tariff began, in 2010, domestic early adopters were paid a whopping 43p per kWh. But they also forked out almost three times as much for their panels. My magic monitor informs me of the sun’s riches each day. My worst day so far – torrential rain – provided just 7p; the last £2 day was a month ago; will I see its like again before spring? Nevertheless, my solar is on track to generate the fitters’ predicted 3,485kWh each year, which is more than my household’s annual electricity consumption. If so, the feed-in tariff will pay me £534.77 tax-free, each year. The solar subsidy currently costs every energy billpayer £9 each year. This is the nub of the case against solar: why should poor billpayers pay for relatively affluent people like me to indulge our “green crap”? The government’s motives for cutting the subsidy were explained more pragmatically by the contractor who measured up for my panels, an old-school property surveyor who had moved into PV. The government looks like it is struggling to meet its legally binding target of renewables providing 15% of UK energy (including heating) by 2020 but such is the dramatic expansion of solar that it doesn’t want to pay millions in subsidies that cause it to exceed this target. So it is sensible to gradually reduce solar subsidy as panel costs fall: people will continue to fit solar and the industry will prosper and eventually be weaned off government support: the Solar Trade Association is begging the government to adopt an “emergency” plan to do just this. It claims it will add just £1 to annual energy bills. When I call Leo Murray, he’s standing by a fake sun – a 10ft helium balloon filled with LED lights in Ravenscourt Park, London. The campaigns director for 10:10, a charity encouraging positive action on climate change, Murray’s lightbulb-like brightness is dimmed by the government’s desire to slash solar support. Who wouldn’t want to exceed our renewables targets, he wonders, when surveys show that solar is the most popular form of energy, with 80% support: “We explain to the public how we all contribute towards solar – it adds a couple of quid on our bills each year – and we can’t find anyone who is anti-renewable energy.” Murray believes the government is tackling the success of solar the wrong way round. It allocated a finite sum of money and now that is almost spent, after the quicker-than-forecast uptake of solar panels, it is pulling the plug. “It’s ideologically driven. It’s coming from the Treasury. You see the looks on DECC [Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change] officials’ faces – they don’t want to be doing this. It’s the most successful and popular climate-change policy ever implemented by the UK government – a demand-led energy policy engaging consumers in the transition to a low-energy economy.” But why should hard-pressed billpayers subsidise expensive solar? “What really gives the lie to that argument is Hinkley [the proposed new nuclear power station]. Even staunch supporters of nuclear don’t think that is a good deal. At £24.5bn, it could be the most expensive object on earth. If you want to keep bills down, don’t do that – it’s definitely going to push bills up.” For Murray, there’s a simple way to ensure wealthy solar investors aren’t subsidised by less affluent billpayers: a solar levy could be progressively applied to bigger electricity bills. (There is a strong correlation between higher bills and higher household wealth, and there could be specific support for exceptions, such as low-income residents of energy-inefficient private rentals.) Murray and 10:10 will continue to support volunteers in community energy. While media coverage has focused on commercial job losses, the solar cuts will also decimate community energy. Since I met Tom Parker in 2014, REPOWERBalcombe has gone from strength to strength. Funded by local people, Parker and his fellow volunteers have opened an 18kW array on a local farm and two smaller rooftop solar systems for schools. The Conservative-dominated local council this month approved their plans for a 4.8MW array which will meet all the power needs for Balcombe and neighbouring West Hoathly. But Parker is despairing at the government’s punitive approach to solar. “We demonstrated that the community hated the idea of fracking and loved the idea of solar and they are trying to prevent other communities from taking the same approach. It’s almost like we’ve been too successful.” It’s not simply the subsidy cut: Parker lists eight major regulatory changes that have made it more difficult for community energy groups. These include making it harder for investors to obtain tax relief, changing the rules over the creation of energy co-ops and making renewable projects such as theirs pay a “climate change levy” – even though they are part of the solution, not the problem. “If someone had set out a year ago to say, ‘How can we most damage co-ops?’, I don’t think they could’ve done any more,” says Parker. As Murray puts it: “These people are volunteers, doing their best to get things off the ground and the ground keeps moving underneath them.” REPOWERBalcombe won’t be able to grow any more, but it’s lucky to have established as many projects as it has, says Parker. Elsewhere, “it’s looking pretty dire for community energy,” admits Murray. “It won’t kill the sector dead but we won’t see any new projects coming forward.” The volunteers running community energy groups normally aspire to expand to a point where they can employ one person to run their project over its 20-year lifespan. The cuts create the prospect of volunteers being forced to manage their groups (committed to paying a return to local people who have invested in them) for 20 years themselves, unable to expand to hand over to a modestly paid professional. “That’s vindictive,” says Murray. “Presumably, it’s not meant to be.” A botched cut in solar support may damage UK PLC, with investors fleeing such an unstable regulatory environment, as the CBI has argued, but it won’t trouble global trends. Solar currently produces 200 gigawatts around the world. Forecasts suggest this will be 1,000 in 10 years’ time but predictions, admits Ajay Gambhir, senior research fellow at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, have been far too pessimistic. Early 21st-century forecasts of a “US$1 per watt” price for solar panels by 2030 were reached in 2011/12. “That is a rapid cost reduction,” says Gambhir. Solar is a modular technology, so manufacturers quickly learn how to refine it when repeatedly making the same component. Chinese manufacturers will reduce costs to 35/40 cents per watt by the decade’s end, predicts Gambhir, confidently. And solar will probably be adopted in developing nations as quickly as the mobile phone in Africa: its modular character is ideal for remote countries with a limited electricity grid. More exciting than ever-cheaper panels is affordable battery technology, which will solve my problem of generating lots of power at midday when I don’t really need it. Elon Musk of Tesla unveiled its Powerwall domestic battery to great fanfare this spring. In Britain, Powervault is selling dishwasher-sized rechargeable battery units for domestic solar for £2,800. “There’s been a lot of interest from early adopters who’d like to use more of the solar energy they generate,” says Joe Warren, managing director of Powervault. He predicts that prices could fall to £1,000 by 2020 with 50,000 UK households buying batteries. It is not just makers who are talking up batteries. As Gambhir explains, increasing the amount of electricity storage has huge value to the National Grid because it helps balance variable supply and erratic demand (we all switch on the kettles during the World Cup final half-time). It also reduces the requirement to have big gas or coal power plants standing by to backup renewables. (Incredibly, the British government recently approved the creation of backup power stations run by diesel generators.) Batteries will also help the grid adjust to the big new challenge posed by the need to charge electric vehicles. Given these services, shouldn’t solar batteries be subsidised? “I don’t know if it’s being considered politically but from an economics of innovation perspective it makes inherent sense,” says Gambhir. Grid parity – when solar is as cheap as gas or coal – is coming. Parity between solar and the retail price for grid electricity has already been reached in Mexico and even Germany. It will arrive in Britain in about four years, but most analysts believe that British solar won’t reach genuine parity with gas or coal (being as cheap to set up a big power station) for a decade. This will be too late to save Britain’s solar industry, if the cuts come. “Solar will get there and private money will eventually fill the gap, but it may not get there nearly as fast [without government support] and there will be more bankruptcies on the way,” says Gambhir. Murray is close to despair. To abandon solar at this moment “doesn’t make business sense and it’s terrible for the environment. The whole thing is a mess. The rest of the world is looking at us and thinking: ‘What are they doing?’” • This article was amended on 21 October 1015.

Promoters claim the schemes offer a steady and predictable income, although they are not without risk. A primary school in Leominster, Herefordshire, is raising money to place solar panels on its roof – with the lure of extraordinary tax breaks. A renewable energy co-operative building wind turbines in Derbyshire and Yorkshire has a scheme expected to give its investors 7.3% a year. In Teesside, local farms and businesses will be powered by turbines promising returns of up to 7.5% a year, while near Liskeard in Cornwall a single wind turbine is claiming that returns should be around 9% a year. Most of the schemes allow savers to invest small sums – from £50 upwards – and some give tax breaks worth 50% off your income tax liability, plus no capital gains or inheritance tax. \"You can get great returns and do something good with your money,\" says Bruce Davis of Abundance Generation, which helps to promote a variety of schemes. \"After raising more than £6.3m for UK renewable energy companies, providing jobs and clean energy for the UK economy, we have shown that people want investments that achieve a real 'win-win': doing something good with money while making a good return.\" Does this all sound a bit too good to be true? When a scheme is promising returns so much higher than the rates paid on deposit accounts, there has to be a catch. And with these schemes, there are several: • Your money is locked away – usually for at least three years and, with some, for as long as 20. Early exit is possible, but not guaranteed. • If the scheme goes bust, you could lose all your money, as the projects are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. • Prices in the energy market could collapse, or expected levels of energy production from a turbine or solar array might not materialise. But if such factors don't put you off, and you want an investment with a social and financial return, here are some examples of what is on offer. Sharenergy A not-for-profit co-operative that helps communities find, build and own renewable energy generation throughout the UK. Its schemes tend to offer shares in the projects, with tax breaks under the Enterprise Investment Scheme. \"It's not just greenies who are investing, but people who like the social enterprise model,\" says director Jon Halle. \"The fact the banks aren't much involved, or that the 'big six' energy firms aren't part of it, has become quite an attractive element for our investors. Our Dingwall project was the first 100% cooperatively owned wind turbine in Scotland, owned by 179 people.\" It is now promoting the Wester Derry Wind Co-op, which is aiming to raise £800,000, with a minimum investment of £250. The anticipated return is 7% a year, and \"pioneer\" investors who join early can expect to obtain 50% tax relief on their investment through the government's Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS). But it is very long term, running over 20 years, best suited, says Halle, to \"patient capital\". In Leominster, the co-op installing solar panels on a new primary school, has so far raised £23,000 of its £150,000 target. It is projecting a return of 4% a year but, with SEIS tax breaks, says that is equal to 10.4% a year – although, again, this is very long-term. Energy 4All Started more than a decade ago, it calls itself \"the UK's leading expert in community-owned renewable energy schemes\". Founder Andrew King was an early investor in the UK's first wind farm co-op, Baywind Energy, and has gone on to help to raise £13m for 10 others. Tom Robinson is a member of the Great Glen, Kilbraur &amp; Skye Co-operatives, supported by Energy4All. \"It has worked out as excellent. There was one year when we only got 7.6%, but then you look at an Isa paying 0.1%. One year it was 10.6%,\" he says. A spokeswoman for Energy4All says it has never failed to raise enough funds, with each scheme oversubscribed. And although members can't simply withdraw their money as they can on a deposit account, she says that every time someone has needed to cash in, other members have willingly stumped up the money, \"because the returns have been so good\". It is currently promoting the Four Winds Energy Cooperative, which has two sites with planning consents, one in Derbyshire, one in Yorkshire. It wants to raise up to £3.7m with a minimum investment of £250. It is targeting a return of 5.1% over the first five years, worth up to 7.3% for investors, who obtain 30% tax relief via the Enterprise Investment Scheme. Abundance Generation Unlike the schemes above, investors lend money rather than buy shares. They can put in as little as £5, and earn returns of between 6% and 9%. Projects open for investment are Engynious Schools, a £1m \"solar on schools\" programme, paying an effective return of 6.7%; BNRG Gorse, a £730,000 solar farm, with ground-mounted panels across a large field in Kent, paying 7.35%, and REG High Down, a £1.5m wind turbine in Cornwall, paying between 8.4% and 9.3%. These projects are all long term – investors should be thinking in a 20-year timeframe – but Abundance has set up a bulletin board where those seeking an earlier exit can sell their holdings. One person currently selling is offering £100 of his stock for £120 just a year after investing – and has had 12 offers. A spokesman for Abundance says: \"Investors don't want their money used in supporting the arms trade, fossil-fuel extraction, or even bonus-hungry bankers. They clearly love it, as most have so far invested in at least three projects and 15% have invested in all seven of those made available so far. To date, nearly £6m has been invested.\" Trillion Fund A crowdfunding platform for renewable energy projects, so-called because its founders reckon that we need to raise $1tn to prevent climate change reaching damaging levels. One of its major shareholders is designer Vivienne Westwood, who says climate change, not fashion, is now her top priority. Its platform includes some of the projects that Abundance Generation is promoting. Last week, it launched funding for E2 Energy, aiming to raise up to £5m for the construction and installation of wind turbines on sites that already have planning permission in the north, Wales and Scotland. It is anticipating returns of 7.5% a year, on a minimum investment of £50. It is structured as a three-year investment, with lenders who put in £1,000 before 31 July getting back £1,225 at the end of three years. \"That's a better risk-adjusted return than on current best-buy, three-year bonds or mainstream peer-to-peer loans,\" says a spokeswoman. Interest on the fund is paid every six months, and it promises to return the capital invested after three years. But like all of these schemes, the money is not protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and investors shoulder the risk of the turbines failing to generate enough electricity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/oct/12/google-environmental-sustainability-data-kate-brandt","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-12T19:27:48Z","webTitle":"How Google is using big data to protect the environment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/12/google-environmental-sustainability-data-kate-brandt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/12/google-environmental-sustainability-data-kate-brandt","fields":{"headline":"How Google is using big data to protect the environment","bodyText":"For many people, Google is simply the gateway to a vast archive of facts and memories. For those who pay closer attention to its business dealings, the company also invests billions to find new ways to use the power of computers: it’s developing robots, virtual reality gear and self-driving cars. Remember all the hubbub about Google Glass? Google has been using the same approach in sustainability – spreading its wealth in a variety of projects to cut its waste and carbon footprint, initiatives which may one day generate profits. During the SXSW Eco conference this week, I caught up with Google’s sustainability officer, Kate Brandt, to find out more. Brandt joined the company in July last year after serving as the nation’s chief sustainability officer in the Obama administration. During her keynote at SXSW Eco in Austin, Texas, Brandt hit all the key environmental initiatives that Google had undertaken over the past decade – at least those that have been announced. Some of the projects involve collecting and analyzing data that enable Google and other businesses to use more sustainable materials, reduce their environmental impact and cut emissions. “When we think about the Third Industrial Revolution and the role Google played in it, we also think about the Fourth Industrial Revolution where this digital backbone could transform our relationship to the material world. We would like to be a player,” she said during her keynote. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is the buzzterm for describing the deepening role that technology plays in our lives. Understandably, Google is big on reducing energy use at its data centers. Another often-cited effort: the company is a big wind and solar energy investor, having signed 2.5 gigawatts worth of contracts around the world and, additionally, committed to investing $2.5bn in renewable energy, including owning stakes in power plants. That makes the company the largest corporate renewable energy buyer if you don’t count utilities, Brandt said. Brandt wouldn’t tell me whether the company plans to put money into energy storage, which is seen as a complementary, if not must-have, technology for renewable energy in overtaking fossil fuels. Energy storage, such as batteries, makes it possible to use renewable energy at a time when solar or wind farms can’t produce electricity. The energy storage market is fairly new, with lots of experiments with a variety of technologies and ways to reduce costs. Brandt said one of the surprising things she learned when she first arrived at Google was the company’s project to create a database of the composition and environmental impact of building materials, something she didn’t know about before. The company had been using the database, called Portico, for its own construction projects, but released a web app last week to make the data more publicly available. Brandt isn’t the first hire at Google to work on sustainability. The tech giant has a decentralized approach: there have been teams embedded in different business units that look at ways to reduce energy use, emissions and waste and to boost productivity and revenues. For instance, there’s a team called Geo for Good that investigates the use of maps, data and machine learning to solve environmental problems, such as creating databases and software to monitor the health of tropical forests around the world or track illegal fishing. There’s also a team that works on serving sustainably grown food within the company. But Brandt appears to have been hired to come up with big picture strategies and make more efficient use of all these disparate sustainability initiatives. That means a lot of cajoling and negotiations with people who don’t necessarily have to answer to her. This is where her experience working as the country’s chief sustainability officer comes in handy, she said. “My current role [is to work] across a lot of different teams. These challenges are so big that it requires partnership,” she told me. What Google does internally is fascinating. At a sustainability conference in June, I attended a panel of three Google employees who recounted their effort to promote reusable menstrual cups, which help to reduce the amount of pads and tampons that end up in landfills. The discussion provided an interesting look into the skepticism and struggle the three women faced in persuading their fellow Googlers to try something new. And, of course, data played a big role: numbers to show the growing public interest in menstrual cups and the large expenses that Google spends on pads and tampons. They ran a pilot project at the company’s headquarters in Mountain View that saw all 250 cups being used in half of the expected time frame and received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback. So the Googlers began looking to do another pilot at a different Google office. I also learned that reducing meat consumption is a touchy subject at Google, where engineers are pampered and cloistered to maximize their productivity. “When we did ‘Meatless Monday’, there was a group that set up a barbecue just outside of the café,” said one of the Google employees at the June conference. So what does Brandt do personally to set a good example? “I take our shuttle to work,” she said, before switching to “we” and her talking points from her keynote. “We are focused on composting, recycling and reusing our water bottles,” she said, pointing to a water bottle on the table in front of her. “We have a bin that’s green for composting, blue for recycling and a little bit of [space] hanging off to the side that’s for landfill waste.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/sep/03/elon-musk-solar-roofs-sustainable-homes-solarcity-panels","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-03T07:00:25Z","webTitle":"Elon Musk aims to refit 5m homes with solar roofs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/03/elon-musk-solar-roofs-sustainable-homes-solarcity-panels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/03/elon-musk-solar-roofs-sustainable-homes-solarcity-panels","fields":{"headline":"Elon Musk aims to refit 5m homes with solar roofs","bodyText":"Elon Musk’s solar company has its sights set on replacing 5m rooftops in the US with traditional roofing materials integrated with solar cell technology. SolarCity’s plans, announced last month, to develop traditional roofs made entirely from solar panels are part of a goal to make sustainable homes more aesthetically appealing, convenient, and ultimately affordable to the average homeowner. It’s betting that people who need to replace their roofs will be attracted to the company’s solar cell option because it won’t require additional work or dramatically alter the look of the home. In an August conference call with investors, company chairman Elon Musk said people are forced to postpone solar adoption when they know a roof replacement is imminent and that “there is a huge market segment that is currently inaccessible to SolarCity.” He added that the company’s solar cell roofing “looks way better” and “lasts far longer than a normal roof”. By integrating a SolarCity roof with Tesla battery packs, it believes those homes could operate on solar power 24-hours a day. The lingering question, however, is whether mainstream homeowners will be able to afford that initial investment. A SolarCity representative was tightlipped on costs, saying they could not share details about the product at this time. Some industry players doubt the product can be affordable to most homeowners. Previous versions of photovoltaic roofs – also called “solar shingles” – have cost up to a third more than traditional solar panels, were less efficient, and were far more pricey to install. “What [the company is] talking about is a paradigm shift, not just a small leap,” says Scott Franklin, owner of Lumos Solar, which specialises in solar panel architecture and design. “SolarCity is known for being a low-cost, fast installer. Now they’re talking about developing an entirely new product and becoming roofers? In terms of cost, they’re going from selling solar leases to telling somebody they have to replace an entire roof. That’s a dramatic cost difference.” In 2009, US multinational Dow Chemical began developing solar shingles. Yet at a price of more than $20,000 per roof, the technology was not commercially viable and Dow discontinued the product in June 2016. “That’ll be the battle – the cost factor,” says Bill Ellard, an economist for the American Solar Energy Society. “But if SolarCity works with some of the major homebuilders and they can invent their own systems, I think there’s a play there.” But even if it succeeds in creating an affordable product, can SolarCity match the success of other eco-home innovations? Smart home devices such as Google’s Nest thermostat are more affordable, and going down in cost each year. Thermostats and energy monitoring systems have taken off in recent years in part because they allow homeowners to cut energy use without changing their behaviour. “Homeowners don’t want to think about efficiency; they want it just taken care of,” says John Quale, a sustainable home design professor at the University of New Mexico. “We are not great about closing curtains or opening windows when we should. That’s why technologies that do things for us are so appealing.” Brian Abramson, cofounder of sustainable homebuilder Method Homes in Seattle, Washington, says smart home technology is becoming more mainstream, lower cost, and accessible. “We probably do Nest thermostats and basic lighting control on 80% of our houses; a couple of years ago there weren’t any smart thermostats, and lighting control was only in 20% of our homes.” Success in the residential solar market, by contrast, is heavily dependent on friendly government policies, a model that has proved challenging when tax incentives threaten to expire, or when monopoly utility companies are allowed to change the way they reimburse solar panel owners for energy put into the grid. By entering the home roofing market, SolarCity is also tacitly acknowledging that aesthetic concerns also hinder solar panel adoption. “Aesthetics are a big deal,” says Franklin. “The first wave of solar adoption was driven by economics or environmental concerns. Now people are already past the ‘I think it’s a good idea’ phase. They want to do it, but it has to look good and add to the value of a home rather than just be a bolted on addition.” The company’s announcement that it will unveil its solar cell roof “in the coming months” followed news that Tesla will acquire SolarCity as part of a master plan to integrate the solar panel company with Telsa battery products. That marriage between power production and storage could be the difference between failures of the past and what Musk hopes to achieve, Quale says. “If you look at the aspirations of Tesla and SolarCity, they have huge potential. Elon Musk is really talking about getting to the masses, and those companies could very well be an important driver in reducing costs,” he says. “The conventional glass panel arrays have come down substantially in cost in the last five years and there’s no reason to think these roofing materials couldn’t fall into that as well.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/live/2019/sep/20/climate-strike-global-change-protest-sydney-melbourne-london-new-york-nyc-school-student-protest-greta-thunberg-rally-live-news-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-21T01:03:18Z","webTitle":"Global climate strike: Greta Thunberg and school students lead climate crisis protest – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2019/sep/20/climate-strike-global-change-protest-sydney-melbourne-london-new-york-nyc-school-student-protest-greta-thunberg-rally-live-news-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/live/2019/sep/20/climate-strike-global-change-protest-sydney-melbourne-london-new-york-nyc-school-student-protest-greta-thunberg-rally-live-news-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Global climate strike: Greta Thunberg and school students lead climate crisis protest – as it happened","bodyText":"For the past 24 hours, the Guardian has been reporting in real time as millions of people joined in a worldwide, youth-led climate strike – with correspondents filing dispatches from the demonstrations across the globe. We’re ending our liveblog here , but not our commitment to covering the climate crisis. Read our roundup of the historic day of action: A moment of appreciation for the doggos These puppers want action on climate change right now. And maybe also a treat, please? Thousands of tech employees walked out of their workplaces to join the climate strike Workers from Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter staged walkouts in what may be the largest coordinated worker action in the history of the tech industry. At the demonstration in Seattle, more than 3,000 tech workers walked out of their workplaces on Friday and thousands more joined actions across the country, according to Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, a group calling for Amazon to make more effort to address climate change. Globally, more than 1,800 Amazon employees walked out across 25 cities and 14 countries on Friday to protest the company’s failure to take more action to address the climate crisis. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s CEO, has made some efforts to address climate concerns, including an announcement on Thursday that the company expects to be carbon neutral by 2040 and a February announcement of a goal, known as Shipment Zero, to be carbon neutral on 50% of shipments by 2030. But workers are asking for more: zero emissions by 2030, increasing the number of electric vehicles in its fleet, and refusing to set contracts with companies that damage the climate. “Amazon still has a long way to go,” said Danilo Quilaton, product designer at Amazon in San Francisco. “What kind of climate leader can we be if we’re still partnering with fossil fuel companies, selling our AI technologies to extract oil faster?” Other tech companies were present at marches in San Francisco and beyond. Twitter workers walked out, marching alongside workers from tech payment firm Square in San Francisco. Facebook workers walked out of offices around the country, including employees who left the headquarters in San Jose. More than 1,800 workers at Google signed a pledge supporting climate action from the company, including zero emissions by 2030, eliminating contracts with oil and gas companies, and promising zero harm to climate refugees. Hundreds walked out of Google offices across the US, including in New York City and at the headquarters in San Jose. “As individuals, we may feel alone in facing climate change,” the Google petition said. “But if we act together – if we act now – we can build a better future.” Amazon workers join the climate strike Hundreds of Amazon workers left their desks Friday to join a thousands-strong climate strike march in Seattle. Workers rallied in front of Amazon’s focal point – the Amazon Spheres, geodesic glass terrariums marking the company’s center of gravity in downtown Seattle – before marching to city hall. The mood was light, their march well ordered and rife with signage playing on Amazon slogans, including “Customer Obsessed = Climate Obsessed”. Those gathered joked that they were skipping a lunch at their desks to join the noontime protest. The grim realities of the climate crisis were mentioned, particularly the challenges facing Amazon warehouse workers in southern California, but the 2,000-or-so workers and throngs of supporters were prepared to celebrate. They’d won, after all, Amazon’s first broad pledge to contain its carbon footprint. EVAN: Bobbing along with a stream of colleagues, Evan Pulgino was awestruck. Pulgino, a software engineer from Pittsburgh who arrived in Seattle three years ago to work at Amazon, was a face in the crowd of several thousand Amazon and Google employees and their supporters. Badges colored to mark seniority, standard at Amazon, hung from lanyards and fobs. Having set out from the Amazon Spheres in downtown Seattle, the tech crowd merged with throngs of high schoolers arriving on Fifth Avenue to join the march on Seattle’s City Hall. Pulgino described the disparate mass of humanity – Amazon’s orderly herd of 20s and 30-somethings mixing with exuberant teens – as “incredible”. Pulgino, who has been active on climate issues since October, said he was cheered by the commitment made Thursday by Amazon to attain zero net carbon emissions by 2040. It was a start, he said, and a heartening one. Pulgino objected to Amazon’s continued financial support for climate change-denying thinktanks and politicians, and to Amazon Web Services’ contracts with fossil fuel companies. “It was important to be part of the fight,” said Pulgino, carrying a sign that read “Stop funding climate denial, start leading for zero emissions”. “Tech drives so much change,” the 38-year-old continued. “If Amazon leads the way, other companies will follow.” ROSHNI: Roshni Naidu, a five-year Amazon veteran, expected something out of Finding Nemo when last year she traveled to Australia to take in the Great Barrier Reef. Naidu, 28, was shocked to find a graying, vacant space. “It was nothing at all like what I expected,” said Naidu, a senior technical product manager. Returning to Seattle shaken by witnessing the degradation of the planet, Naidu got to work at her work. She began agitating with other Amazon employees for the company to get it right on climate change. Amazon, she said, can lead on climate. She described herself as “cautiously celebratory” after company leaders announced a suite of climate change-related reforms aimed at eliminating Amazon’s carbon footprint by 2040. “It’s a sign that collective action works,” Naidu said. Friday’s march, she added, “puts even more pressure on Amazon to do more.” It’s great, she said, to be able to say she’s “saving the world”. NICK: Milling among his climate activist colleagues, Nick Andrews, a program manager now in his sixth year at Amazon, was ready to scream. Which, as a chant leader, was his job for the afternoon. Andrews, 32, had been active for months pushing Amazon to reduce its climate footprint and cut ties to the fossil fuel industry. Like several of his colleagues, he struck a tone more disappointed than angry. Amazon workers tend to believe their company can do anything, including save the planet. At the outset, Andrews said, pushing the sometimes autocratic company seemed like it would be nerve-racking work. It didn’t turn out that way. “Everyone came in with trepidation,” Andrews said. “But it’s really received a company-wide embrace.” It helps, he said, that he and other Amazonians turn out – unsurprisingly to those who’ve watched the company come to dominate the retail economy and cloud computing – to be “very good organizers”. He celebrated on Thursday when Amazon leaders announced a series of steps designed to eliminate Amazon’s net carbon footprint. He looks forward to Amazon doing more, though. “We pride ourselves on being a bar-pushing company,” Andrews said. “This is a good start, but I think we can do better.” The Guardian has partnered with Friends of the Earth to highlight the climate crisis and raise funds for the charity, which is doing so much to address the damage that has been done and continues to be done to the planet. Scenes from Richmond, California – a town under Chevron’s shadow The main climate strike action in the Bay Area today was in the center of San Francisco, always a magnet for regional progressive activism. But across the bay, Richmond, population 110,000, more than held its own. The small crowd at the city’s civic center peaked at about 100 before a short youth-led march. Speakers took turns addressing the group from atop a park bench, rallying with call-and-response chants and songs, and impromptu speeches about factory farming, a Green New Deal and geoengineering. But while this may have been a small branch of a global day of action, the main thrust here was local issues, as residents shared updates on local organizing efforts to stop the climate pollution happening in their own town. Richmond is actually younger than the 117-year-old, 2,900 acre Chevron oil refinery that occupies much of the city’s scenic bayside hillscape, and the fossil fuel giant has long exerted outsized influence not just over the city’s environment, but also its politics. Richmond also feels the impact of over a million tons of coal and petroleum byproducts exported from its bayside terminal each year – the city’s asthma rates are far above those of other Bay Area communities. Urgency on the global climate crisis won the day worldwide, but in Richmond and other front-line cities, the impacts of the fossil fuel industry and issues of environmental justice feel even more immediately dire. ‘It is like they are burning our soul’: Brazil’s indigenous people call for international help At the third Rio de Janeiro demonstration of the day, Tereza Arapiun, a chief from the Arapiun tribe from the Amazon state of Pará, called for international help for Brazil’s indigenous people. “We are surrounded by destruction, loggers and mining,” she said. “We need help.” Amazon deforestation, fires and land invasions worsened under Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, she said. “He encourages it. Before, there was protection. He destroyed it.” Arapiun welled up as she told how a friend described hearing the screams of dying animals as fires raged recently near Alter do Chão, a renowned beauty spot in the same state. “It is very painful. It is like they are burning our soul,” she said. “We need help – and help won’t come from Brazil.” Colombian demonstrators demand a world “without plastic and without war” Demonstrators have begun to gather at parks and squares across Colombia now. Here in Bogotá – the capital – the historic Plaza de Bolívar in front of the congress building is slowly drawing crowds despite the rain. “Colombia, our land,” one group of students chanted as they arrived. “Without plastic and without war!” Near the statue of the country’s independence hero Simón Bolívar, demonstrators banged drums and burnt incense, waving signs that read “Rebel or burn out”. “When the problem is as urgent as climate change, it’s only by coming together that we can make a difference,” said Alejandra Moreno, a student from Bogotá. Unlike many similar events around the world, this one was not preceded by a major strike and schools were open as normal. This could be because events got little publicity in local media. The two main dailies, El Espectador and El Tiempo, ran agency-written stories online on worldwide strikes that did not once mention Colombia. Instead, the mantle to promote today’s march was picked up by an opposition political party, Colombia Humana, and local environmental activists. Both used social media extensively. “Why in London are people so willing to move to pressure their government and the world for drastic measures to attack the climate crisis and not in Colombia, if the problem is the same?” the senator Gustavo Petro – the leader of Colombia Humana and a former presidential candidate – tweeted this morning. “Because of something called asymmetrical information: in Colombia the danger is ignored.” Colombia has made efforts to position itself as a regional leader on environmental issues, recently hosting a summit in its Amazonian city Leticia, where Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru agreed on measures to tackle the nearby raging rainforest fires. However, local activists say it is just window-dressing given that Colombia remains one of the most dangerous countries for environmentalists. Twenty-four environmental activists were murdered here in 2018, second only to the Philippines, according to the watchdog Global Witness. “Colombia is living through constant threats of damage to ecosystems and deforestation, and our cities are heating up,” said Isabel Cristina Zuleta, an environmental activist with the Rios Vivos movement, who has received many death threats for her work. She was attending a march in Medellín, Colombia’s second largest city. “In Colombia, to protest and to march is to put yourself at risk,” Zuleta said. “That’s why today it is so important to see people in the streets.” Protesters in Miami Beach wrap it up, head to “End of the World” after party The climate strike has wrapped up in Miami Beach after a “historic” day that saw thousands of schoolchildren, college students and workers gather at two events at city hall. But organizers say this is just the start of something much bigger. “You saw how many people were here, it was incredible,” said youth climate activist John Paul Mejia, who spoke at the morning school strike and evening rally for those who couldn’t take time off during the day. “Now we need to keep the conversation going, to build on this historic day and get things done.” The Miami protestors were heading for an after-strike party with live music at a bar in nearby Overtown arranged by 350southflorida, an environmental group. The relaxation will be short, however. Next week’s planned protest activities include a sit-in at Miami Beach’s sustainability committee meeting and a strike in downtown Miami at Chase Bank, which 350southflorida says is the world’s biggest funder of fossil fuels. The “week of action” wraps up with an End of the World party on the second Global Climate Strike day next Friday. Young activists in Brazil: less CO2, more vida There were small demonstrations across Brazil on Friday. In the morning, dozens of school and university students occupied the steps of Rio de Janeiro’s state legislature in hot sun. They sang, waved placards and called for the removal of business-friendly environment minister Ricardo Salles. Striking high school student Maria Hardman, 15, was angry over far-right president Jair Bolsonaro’s failure to protect the Amazon. “He does not value the environment,” she said. “Bolsonaro is an imbecile. He does not represent me.” Brazilians have yet to grasp the scale of the climate emergency, said Mariana Império, 30, a masters student at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Thalita Alves, 20, a trainee teacher at the Federal Fluminense University, said people began waking up when fires in the Bolivian Amazon caused São Paulo skies to darken. “Brazilians who voted for Bolsonaro … faithfully believe what he says,” she said. Later another demonstration marched from Ibama, the environmental agency, to the city centre. High school students formed a human mosaic reading: “Save the Amazon” in Recife and held up placards with data on Amazon fires in Salvador. Students marched in the town of Novo Friburgo and in the capital Brasília, an SOS Amazon banner was hung on the walls of the environment ministry. In the Amazon city of Belém, hundreds gathered beside the Marajó Bay. “Coming from the Amazon, I feel it’s a duty to fight,” said Lidia Seabra, 24, studying a masters in biology at the Federal University of Pará. “We are united here to defend the Amazon,” said engineering student Devyison de Jesus, 21. In São Paulo, a few thousand blocked Paulista Avenue after cheering speeches from children such as Cora Ramos, 10, who held up a placard she had made that read “there is no planet B”. “If we destroy this one, there won’t be another,” she said. Brazilian activists were also present at marches abroad. Alessandra Munduruku, an indigenous activist from the Munduruku tribe of Pará state, made a short, powerful speech to an enormous crowd in Berlin. “My people are grateful to have good people fighting and defending the Amazon,” she said through a translator to deafening cheers. “I saw many children, many young people, parents, old people, I thought that demonstration was very beautiful,” she told the Guardian. “I had goosebumps.” Mexico City protestors to AMLO: “We want a future, not hydrocarbons!” Climate protests started early outside the National Palace in central Mexico City, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador usually holds a daily press conference. The president – commonly called AMLO – was instead in the state of Yuctán on Friday and didn’t speak of the climate issue. But he boasted, “The fall in [Mexican] petroleum production has stopped and we’re starting to produce more petroleum. ... We’re now producing more petrol in Mexico’s refineries.” AMLO has bet big on boosting Mexico’s petroleum output and promised to lower the price of gasoline. He’s also pushed ahead with plans to build an $8bn refinery in the state of Tabasco – even starting construction prior to completing the environmental permits. AMLO also cancelled an electricity auction, which would have allowed more renewable energy into the market, and the Federal Electricity Commission (CRE) has announced plans to instead burn more coal. “There a campaign that renewables are cheaper and it’s a lie,” CFE director Manuel Bartlett said earlier this year. The government’s focus on fossil fuels has put in question the country’s commitment to generate 35% of its energy with renewables by 2024, according to climate change analysts. Marchers in Mexico City targeted AMLO, chanting, “We want a future, not hydrocarbons!” Greta Thunberg: “Change is coming whether they like it or not.” The crowd in Battery Park roared in anticipation of Greta Thunberg, who was introduced by Alexandria Villaseñor, Thunberg’s NYC equivalent who her spends her Fridays protesting outside the UN headquarters in New York City. “Greta! Greta! Greta!” the crowd chanted as Thunberg got on the stage. The 16-year-old started her speech off by marking the number of people who participated in the strike around the world. In New York City, 250,000 people marched. Worldwide, more than 4m demonstrated. Thunberg’s directed her speech to the hundreds of students in the crowd, though she acknowledged that adults also skipped worked to strike. “We will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse, even if it means skipping school or work, because this is more important,” Thunberg said. “Why should we study for a future that is being taken away from us?” Thunberg had to pause her speech twice to point out that people in the crowd needed medical attention. Many people had been in the sun all afternoon waiting for Thunberg to speak. The crowd patiently waited for Thunberg to start speaking again, each time cheering when she continued. Thunberg elicited laughter when she described all the politicians she had met who asked for selfies and “tell us they really, really admire what we do” yet have done nothing to address the climate crisis. “We demand a safe future. Is that really to much to ask?” “No!” the crowd shouted back. At the end of her speech, Thunberg emphasized that the strikes around the world are just the start of change. “If you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us, we have some very bad news for you, because this is only the beginning,” Thunberg said. “Change is coming whether they like it or not.” Students in the crowd said they felt moved seeing Thunberg speak in person. “I started crying. I just found it powerful and empowering,” said Juliana Rubiano, 16. “She represents a lot of people, and that’s us, that’s the youth.” Californians are no strangers to the climate crisis fight – and now they’re taking on the federal government California is not a place that requires convincing that the climate is changing. The people here don’t even need to see the science — they’re feeling the impacts firsthand, as the state teeters between an eroding coastline and growing wildland fires. Perhaps because of its many vulnerabilities, California has taken arguably the strongest stance of any US state in fighting the climate crisis, at times also fighting with the federal government in the process. When the Trump administration moved to undo California’s strict vehicle emissions standards this month, the state vowed to fight. Governor Gavin Newsom hit back with, of course, a tweet: “We will prevail. See you in court.” Earlier this week, the University of California pledged to divest over $80bn in endowment and pension funds from fossil fuel companies, citing the “financial risk” posed by the industry, compared to renewable energy. Climate advocates called it the biggest single commitment by any university, and perhaps the beginning of a new divesting trend. California cities, including Berkeley and San Jose, are leading the country with a wave of local laws to phase out natural gas hook-ups in new construction, despite strong and well-funded opposition from the gas industry. Natural gas is the greatest source of carbon emissions from buildings, while fully electrifying homes and businesses could allow them to run on clean, renewable energy instead. California’s municipalities have also taken direct aim at the industry responsible for so much of the climate crisis. Eight cities and counties in the state have filed civil lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, alleging public nuisance and in some cases negligence. The suits seek billions of dollars in damages to help mitigate climate impacts. Maanvi Singh, here — taking up the Guardian’s live climate strike coverage from the West Coast. Coming up, West Coast environment correspondent Susie Cagle will be sharing sketches and scenes from the demonstration in Richmond, California, across the bay from San Francisco. A Chevron refinery older than the town itself looms over it, and the area is home to some of the boldest climate-minded activism in California. Technology reporter Kari Paul will be following up on climate walkouts at Amazon, Twitter, Facebook and Google. And Los Angeles correspondent Sam Levin will bring us dispatches from the protests in southern California. Mexico City protests: thousands take to the streets Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Mexico City to join the global climate strike this afternoon. “Se ve, se siente, la tierra está caliente,” the crowds shouted as they processed down the city’s main avenue, Reforma towards its presidential palace. “You see it, you feel it. The earth is getting hotter.” Protesters - many of them school children and teenagers - carried homemade banners reading: “There’s no money in a dead earth” and “Action now!” One placard urged demonstrators to make love, not CO2. There were reports of other demonstrations, big and small, across Mexico in cities including Acapulco, Irapuato, Guadalajara and Tijuana. Unlike in Brazil, where far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has ignored today’s movement, the protests received the blessing of the Mexican government which tweeted its support. In a Twitter video Victor Toledo, Mexico’s environment secretary, urged the country to reflect on the environment “insurgency” taking place around the world and to take action where possible. ‘There is no Planet B’ Best friends Amaya Mejia, 10, and Scarlett Harrison, 11, skipped school together to join the Miami Beach youth climate strike, after staying up late the night before to craft their placards. Amaya opted for a globe with the simple message: “There is no Planet B”. “You need to listen to us, it’s the only planet we’ve got and we need to protect it,” said Amaya, who attends the Gulliver private school in Coral Gables. Messages on banners ranged from simple and effective like Amaya’s, to the deeply political and often comical. “The government can regulate my uterus but not single-use plastics?” read one. Another student held aloft a sign informing the crowd: “I’m not showing up for school because adults aren’t showing up for children,” while another said: “You’ll die of old age, I’ll die of climate change.” More locally-themed placards, referencing the threat of sea level rise to Miami Beach, a hugely popular tourism destination, included one that read: “Take a stand before our city is all sand.” My favorite, however, was perhaps the most understated message of the day. “I’m very upset,” it read. Covering Climate Now Covering the climate crisis is absolutely core to the Guardian’s editorial mission. And all this week, we have been a lead partner in Covering Climate Now, an initiative founded earlier this year with the Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation. This has led to more than 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries – with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people – signing on to amplify and share content on climate change. There has been a burst of coverage this week on the Guardian and beyond ahead of the UN climate summit next week on Monday 23 September. Check out some of our pieces this week including: The silenced: meet the climate whistleblowers muzzled by Trump The sinking class: the New Yorkers left to fight the climate crisis alone How TV weathercasters became the unsung heroes of the climate crisis ‘Like a sunburn on your lungs’: how does the climate crisis impact health? Thousands of people are striking in Boston, Massachusetts Organizers expected some 10,000 people to rally at City Hall Plaza for the Boston Climate Strike organized by youth climate activists. Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu and former Environmental Protection Agency head Gina McCarthy were among scheduled speakers, according to NBC10 Boston. Miami striker: ‘Does it matter if we’re under 15 feet of water or 50 feet?’ Dan Gelber, the mayor of Miami Beach, received a warmer reception than any politician might have expected when he emerged to address the hundreds of student climate campaigners making a racket right outside his office window. Perhaps it’s the $500m dollars his city is investing over the next five years to combat the effects of sea level rise, which already leaves neighborhoods under water during higher than usual tides. Scientists predict up to a three feet sea level rise by 2050. Gelber pointed out the strides already taken to improve things on this island city barely seven by one miles in size: an aggressive program of elevating roads and laying larger capacity drainage pipes, along with investing in modern pump equipment and technology to faster shift the rising flood waters. It’s little wonder the environmentally-conscious city’s slogan is Rising Above. And today the Miami Herald reported on what could become the city’s most ambitious project yet, a proposal to turn the city-owned golf course into a 115-acre wetland park, which the newspaper says is certain to test the boundaries of what the public will accept in the name of resilience. “Change is never easy,” Miami Beach commissioner Ricky Arriola said. “If we’re truly serious about dealing with climate change then everything is on the table, including the golf course. If we’re not willing to even talk about it then we’re just paying lip service.” Gabriella Marchesani, 17, organizer of the Miami Beach youth climate strike, praises the city’s efforts but says more needs to be done to address the causes of the climate crisis as well as dealing with its effects. “Miami Beach has spent a lot of money on adaptation, it can be the leading city and we hope other cities in Florida will follow,” she said. “But this cannot be done slowly, and we need climate policy. Does it matter if we’re under 15 feet of water or 50 feet?” Thousands converge on Battery Park, New York Most New York strikers have now made it down to Battery Park where a stage has been set up close to the water. Hundreds of people are packed around the stage, Greta is slated to speak, and many more are camped out sitting on the grass in the park. Young speakers took the stage giving personal testimonies of how the climate crisis is affecting them, denouncing politicians on both sides, saying just believing the facts isn’t enough without action. When Jaden Smith took the stage, people started running the stage. In between two songs he reminded the crowd: “We gotta show people we care about this.” Climate meme power Dorian victims convinced of link to climate change Reporting from the hurricane-hit Bahamas last week, I met David Dean, a sous chef at one of its holiday resorts. “My wife and kids had me as ‘dead’ on Facebook because they couldn’t find me,” he said. “When I called them, there was a lot of crying.” Like many in these Caribbean islands, Dean is convinced that the climate crisis in making hurricanes such as Dorian more likely and more intense. “It was very hot,” the 38-year-old said. “That’s why the hurricane was coming to us. Heat brings the hurricane and makes it worse.” Some 52 people are confirmed dead in the Bahamas, a figure expected to rise, and more than 1,300 are still missing. The scale of destruction was astonishing, as if a giant with a child’s temperament had run amok, flipping over cars and buses like toys. As so often, the underclass suffers the most. The science is complex but this Guardian article explains how global heating made Dorian bigger, wetter and deadlier. Many in the Bahamas are determined to stay the course, not least because tourism is so crucial to the economy. The owners of the hard hit Treasure Cay beach, marine and golf resort declared their intention to rebuild. But some residents also expressed concern that such efforts could be undone by the next hurricane, and the one after that. For now the Bahamas is dealing with scars, mental and physical. Dean told me: “Now, if I feel a little rain, it might be drive me crazy. I’m traumatised. I don’t ever want to go through that again.” This video is great at capturing some of the scale of the New York action. Which countries contribute most to the climate crisis? How much is the US to blame? China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US, the European Union, India and Russia. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China’s carbon footprint. What has happened to the US Environmental Protection Agency with climate change? The EPA has begun efforts to eliminate climate rules for power plants, cars and the methane leaked from oil and gas facilities. Has the US already pulled out of the Paris accord? What if Democrats win next election? The US has not yet exited the international accord, in which every other nation on earth agreed to voluntarily begin to curb emissions. The deal was meant to prevent global average temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Technically, the US cannot leave the agreement until the day after the November 2020 election, when Trump will still be president regardless of the outcome. A Democrat president could rejoin the deal. Is Donald Trump making climate change worse with his rollbacks? The US is falling far short of its commitments to curb heat-trapping pollution, in part because Trump has gutted efforts made by his predecessor, Barack Obama. The country is on track to cut emissions 13% to 16% below 2005 levels by 2020, according to the analysis firm Rhodium Group. That’s short of the 17% reduction the US promised in the Copenhagen Accord. “Looking ahead to 2025, the US is on track to achieve reductions anywhere from 12% to 19% below 2005 levels absent major policy changes—a far cry from its Paris Agreement pledge to reduce emissions 26% to 28%,” Rhodium Group explains. The US, however, represents 15% of world emissions. Is Donald Trump a climate change denier? What is his record? Before becoming president, Trump called climate change a Chinese hoax. In an interview with Piers Morgan, he deflected questions about how his policies promote continued climate-change causing emissions. He said the US has “the cleanest climates” and “China, India, Russia, many other nations, they have not very good air, not very good water.” Trump’s White House has downplayed the dangers of the climate crisis, including disagreeing with a federal report showing it threatens the US economy. Many of the president’s appointees have denied climate change, and government scientists say their work on the crisis has been silenced. It is, of course, worth keeping in mind today the specific demands that climate groups have for meaningful action. The Youth Climate Strike Coalition in the US, has issued a set of policy demands which includes: Transform our economy to 100% clean, renewable energy by 2030 and phase out all fossil fuel extraction through a just and equitable transition, creating millions of good jobs A halt to all leasing and permitting for fossil fuel extraction, processing and infrastructure projects immediately Respect of Indigenous Land and Sovereignty and Environmental Justice Protection and restoration of 50% of the world’s lands and oceans including a halt to all deforestation by 2030 Investment in farmers and regenerative agriculture and an end to subsidies for industrial agriculture Downtown New York City is packed with sign-bearing people of all ages, though the crowd noticeably skews young. Students from all over NYC have come to the march. Many young children are accompanied by their parents while middle and high school students are here with their friends. Almost all groups have posters in hand. On the way down to the march, I caught up with students from Professional Performing Arts School, who caught the subway to attend the strike together. They met up at school and decided to go to the march in a group. “I just want the world to exist the way I knew it was growing up,” said Nyla Robothan, a 15-year-old student at the school, on why she’s striking. Many say this isn’t their first march, having participating in other climate marches or the March For Our Lives protest in 2018. They say that they feel like their future feels uncertain because of the climate crisis, yet no one is listening to their generation. “Our planet is dying, and no one’s going to be doing anything except for us right now,” said Arlene Guevara, 17, a student at Beacon High School in Manhattan. The march is slowly making its way down to Battery Park at the southern tip of Manhattan, where speakers, including Greta Thunberg, are slated to speak in the afternoon. We are expecting hundreds of Amazon workers to strike later in their HQ city of Seattle, Washington. Levi Pulkkinen is there to report on this for us and ahead of the strikes there, sent us this explainer of how some of the giant firm’s workers are taking action and Thursday’s move by Jeff Bezos pledging to improve Amazon’s environmental impact: After months agitating for climate accountability from their employer, Amazon.com workers celebrated Thursday as the Seattle-based retail and cloud computing giant pledged to zero out carbon emissions by 2040. The announcement from CEO Jeff Bezos came as about 1,500 Amazon workers prepared to walkout Friday as part of the global strike for climate change. The disruption would mark the first time white-collar Amazon workers have walked off the job. Asserting that Bezos’ pledge “proves that collective action and employee pressure works,” organizers of the stoppage reiterated demands that Amazon Web Services stop doing business with fossil fuel companies, and that the company cut ties with lobbyists, politicians and researchers hostile to climate science. Those calls were left unaddressed by the company, which did announce plans to acquire 100,000 electric delivery vans manufactured by an Amazon-funded company and an $100m commitment to an environmental restoration fund managed by The Nature Conservancy. In a statement, Bezos described the initiatives as evidencing a shift within Amazon. “We’re done being in the middle of the herd on this issue — we’ve decided to use our size and scale to make a difference,” Bezos said. “If a company with as much physical infrastructure as Amazon — which delivers more than 10 billion items a year — can meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early, then any company can.” Amazon, making good on a promise offered earlier in the year, also for the first time released an accounting of its carbon footprint. The assessment, audited by Paris-based certification agency Bureau Veritas, showed Amazon’s direct and indirect CO2 emissions amounted to 44.4 million metric tons in 2018, a year that saw 37.1 billion metric tons of the greenhouse gas released globally. The Guardian’s Latin American correspondent Tom Phillips has spotted a striking banner in Guadalajara, Mexico. Here’s some footage from climate strikes around the world today: Miami student Greta Rodriguez feels exactly the same way as the famous teenage climate activist who shares her first name, and had a similar message as she joined dozens of classmates to protest in Miami Beach: We’ve just had enough. The 15-year-old was among a party of 50 students from the Cushman private school in Key Biscayne who wanted to make their voices heard in this low-lying coastal city that is recognized as ground zero for sea level rise. “We’ve had enough of big business and their trash, burning fossil fuels, depleting the earth,” she said. “It has to change.” Chaperoned by biology teacher Jen Russell, the Cushman kids were among the loudest at the Miami Beach strike. “They wanted to be here and the student government association organized the whole thing,” Russell said. “It was important to them. We can talk to them as adults but it’s the children who have the voice, it’s their future.” The Miami Beach strike drew hundreds of students from schools, colleges and universities across South Florida. A similar, simultaneous event outside the Broward school district headquarters in Fort Lauderdale attracted another large crowd. While private schools such as Cushman turned up with numbers, local public school leaders proved less amenable to students walking out of classes, however. Elijah Ruby, 17, a senior at South Broward high school, was banned from his prom for handing out flyers for the Fort Lauderdale event, according to the Miami Herald, and both the Broward and Miami-Dade school districts announced that absences for the strike would be recorded as unexcused. At the New York event are Zariah, age seven, and Lori Sapphire, who says: “We’re here to save the planet. So no packaging. It’s an easy solution. Focus on solar energy. No more cars burning oil. Stop taking every mineral from the earth. Go back to the simple ways. “There’s enough for everyone. Stop burning the forests because we want to eat meat and soybeans. Use hemp for everything. It almost a joke that everything were doing is being so selfishly and unconsciously. It like we’re not from the planet, otherwise we’d care.” The crowds in New York are massive but everyone is slowly making their way down to Battery Park. Earlier at the breakfast meeting for indigenous people from the Amazon and Indonesia, 19 year old Artemisa Barbosa Ribeiro, a climate activist known as Artemisa Xakriabá, told the Guardian she is thankful for all the young people who are joining the movement. “ I can see a future where we can make a difference but for that we must be listened to and respected,” she said, describing how her people, the Xakriabá peoples, a group of approximately 12 thousand people who live on the left bank of the São Francisco River, in the municipality of São João das Missões, in the state of Minas Gerais, have watched as mining companies have denied them access to the river and its water. “The scarcity of water in the territory is noticeable” she says. “ We need the river and the water for our living and for our spiritual health, our connection to the earth. So access to the river is a big issue for us.” Ribeiro, who was recently in Washington DC to demand action from members of the US congress alongside Greta Thunberg, said she felt that Jaire Bolsnaro’s government have a plan for all indigenous people. “I believe they want to assassinate us,” she said frankly. “It’s got much worse in the last eight months. We need support from outside the country because from the inside we have no support. “The main thing you can do in the west to help is to stop importing hard wood because that is causing deforestation and exploitation. That is the best way you can help,” Ribeiro added. Here is a message from Greta Thunberg, who will be making a speech at the New York event later in Battery Park: There are many, many hundreds of protesters in DC. Blocks and blocks of a roughly 6-lane street filled and more coming and marching toward the US Capitol. I can’t see the end. This gives you a sense of how big the gathering in New York is - so many people want to participate. Delaney Reynolds has addressed the general assembly of the United Nations on the climate crisis. She has appeared in a prime time National Geographic special, written books, won awards, launched a non-profit battling sea rise, shared a stage with Al Gore and changed laws in almost a decade as an environmental activist and entrepreneur. She is also still only 20. “The youth voice is extremely powerful,” says Reynolds, a speaker at this morning’s youth climate strike in Miami Beach. “I hope our elected leaders realise that current young voters and soon-to-be voters care passionately about this issue and very much want to see something done about it.” Reynolds is not afraid to play hardball to tackle the climate emergency. She is the lead plaintiff of eight young Floridians currently suing their state and its governor for “violating their fundamental rights to a stable climate system” through their reliance on fossil fuels. But she knows collaboration can work just as well as confrontation. As a teenager she was instrumental in getting the city of South Miami to adopt Florida’s first law requiring solar panels on newly-built homes. “We also spoke at a Miami-Dade budget hearing and the same day after hearing the children speak the county created the post of chief resilience officer,” she said. “The young generation is starting to realise our voice matters. Our leaders are going to have to pay attention if a bunch of kids stop going to school and start standing on their steps at city hall. They may not have a vote but they do have a voice.” The climate strike is being held the same day as the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico and left nearly 3,000 people dead. In recognition of that event, the climate strike is happening in concert with a Puerto Rico Day of Action to highlight the struggles the island still faces in its effort to rebuild, while remaining vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Marisol Rivera, a 13-year-old Puerto Rican student in Brooklyn, has been speaking on Friday about Maria and how it impacted her family, She will connect the issues there to the climate crisis. Other Puerto Rican activists will also speak at the event, including Gustavo Rivera, a New York state senator (he is unrelated to Marisol). Puerto Rico is still recovering from the hurricane, which affected all of the 3.5 million Americans who lived on the island. Its power grid was knocked out completely by the storm and families reported having no electricity nearly a year after the hurricane. Here are some photographs of people gathering in New York’s Foley Square. Donald Trump is set to attend the United Nations headquarters during Monday’s key summit on the climate crisis – but will be there to take part in a meeting on religious freedom instead. A senior UN official confirmed to the Guardian that the White House has booked one of the large conference rooms in the New York headquarters on Monday so that the president can address a gathering on religious freedom. The move is likely to be seen as a blatant snub to the UN climate summit, to be held in the same building on the same day. Leaders from around the world, including the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson; France’s president, Emmanuel Macron; and India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, are expected at the summit as part of a major UN push to heighten the response to the escalating climate crisis. UN sources said the booking of the room was relatively last minute and will cause some logistical issues given the major security operation that accompanies the US president wherever he goes. But a senior UN official said they were “not panicked” given the large organizational capacity of the UN general assembly. “No one was really expecting the president to come to the climate summit,” the official said. It’s understood that senior UN staff have realistic expectations of Trump and do not expect him to engage on the climate crisis, even for a summit held in his hometown. Trump has vowed the US will withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement. Many folks have come to New York from all over the world to attend today’s strike, planning their trips months in advance. Our Village, a coalition made of indigenous groups and communities of color, spoke to reporters this morning, in a studio space in New York City where they were making signs and distributing T-shirts in anticipation of the march. Dinaman Tuxá, traveled from Bahia, Brazil with a delegation of six Brazillians from all over the country to speak out against the injustices against indigenous communities in Brazil. “We’re going through a process of genoicde. … President Bolsonaro, he’s spreading hate against the indigenous populations of Brazil,” Tuxá said through a translator. “Us, the indigenous people, we are the guardians of the forest. … We need the world to recognize our contributions and help us protect our territories.” Tuxá said that he traveled to New York because Brazillians aren’t listening to the cry of indigenous communities in their country, so they’re making an international cry in anticipation of the UN climate summit. The United Nations headquarters in New York will play host tonight to an immersive art installation by artist Joseph Michael that features images of an iceberg and six young advocates, including Greta Thunberg, addressing hopes and fears around the climate crisis. We have some pictures from last night’s final rehearsal: We will be live through the rest of the day here in the US with Oliver Milman, Lauren Aratani and Ed Helmore reporting on the big rally in New York city. Emily Holden, meanwhile, is out with activists in Washington DC while Richard Luscombe is at the strikes in Miami Beach. Later on, Levi Pulkkinen in Seattle will be with more than 1,500 corporate Amazon workers expected to strike to highlight criticisms of the company’s climate policies. CEO Jeff Bozos said on Thursday that Amazon would do more and pledged the firm would be carbon neutral by 2040. Susie Cagle, meanwhile, will be reporting on the strikes from the city of Richmond, California, and we’ll also have a dispatch from Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro. All week, the Guardian has been part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate emergency. Welcome from the Guardian’s office in New York, where we are now anchoring live coverage of these calls for climate action, which have drawn huge crowds around the world. We expect the US will be staging its largest ever climate strike, with actions planned in more than 1,000 locations, including major rallies in New York, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami. Here at the Guardian’s New York office, members of our team in midtown Manhattan walked out at midday local time to participate in the strike. Further downtown, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg will be leading a big strike rally which she is expected to speak at later in the day, ahead of addressing the UN’s Climate Action Summit next week. Activists are gathering in Foley Square, near City Hall, and will start marching south on Broadway at 1pm ET to rally in Battery park. There have already been significant protests across the world today with millions joining the climate strike to urge politicians and businesses to take action to avert the climate crisis. With parts of the US just waking up and others still asleep it’s far from over so I’m handing over to my colleague Mark Oliver, who is taking over the blog and will keep you abreast of all the latest developments in the US and elsewhere. Back in the UK, the police monitoring group Netpol says that officers are restricting protesters in London by kettling them (for those unfamiliar with the British vernacular it means confining demonstrators in a small area) on the southside of Westminster Bridge. New York is standing up! The Rolling Stones legend Keith Richards has endorsed the climate strike, realising that Time is not actually On Our Side (sorry). The Guardian has partnered with Friends of the Earth to highlight the climate crisis and raise funds for the charity, which is doing so much to address the damage that has been done and continues to be done to the planet. Here is a country I’m not sure we’ve featured on the blog so far today. With the US protests beginning, it feels like a good time to highlight this article on the huge impact climate change could have on the nation if it is not arrested. The US is waking up (in more ways than one) and already there are sizeable crowds reported. Here is a useful reminder about the impact of flying. You can also calculate the impact of your next trip. Anuna De Wever, 18, a cofounder of Belgium’s school strike movement, which has organised 20 nationwide strike days since January, said today’s protest in Brussels made her feel hopeful. It was amazing, we had 20,000 across the streets. I am really happy about this strike because I feel like after coming on the streets after 20 weeks, this is our season two. There are so many people ready and it just makes me feel very hopeful. But she added: Belgium is doing really badly on the climate crisis. There is not any ambition from any of our politicians. So we are really asking them to take responsibility because right now we don’t have a climate policy and they really need to take responsibility. While Belgium has signed the Paris Agreement, the three Belgian regions (Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia) have so far been unable to agree on the distribution of emissions cuts. De Wever thinks the school strike movement is helping to bridge these old political divides. There are some arguments, especially in politics but we don’t care about that and we want to unite everyone to fight with us. I think it’s beautiful that no one is thinking about this, are they from the Walloon side or are they from the Flemish side. The Brussels protest finished close to the headquarters of the European commission and European council - not an accidental choice as the EU debates decarbonising its economy by 2050. Earlier in the day, De Wever and other activists met the European commission vice president, Frans Timmermans, who has been tasked with drawing up a Green New Deal to allow the EU to move away from fossil fuel and meet its climate pledges. The bulk of those still taking part in the climate strike in London reached the entrance to Trafalgar Square a little earlier, where police blocked it off at Northumberland Avenue, to chants of “let them through”. Many people are on their way home now. I was speaking at the back of the crowd to two new mothers, Chloe Reeves and Lauren Slattery, who had brought along their children, Leo (five months) and Phoenix (seven months). While deeply concerned about the climate crisis – to the extent that they have discussed jointly purchasing land on higher ground for children as a reaction to rising sea levels - they’ve been drawing some encouragement from the international focus of the strikes. “To be honest as a new mother I’ve been putting all my energy into the basic job of keeping baby alive and looking after him and I’ve purposefully not thought about climate change because it has freaked me out so much, but now my mother instincts have allowed me to shift a bit of emphasis on to things like this and the action that we need to take,” said Chloe. Lauren added: “Actions like today have really been inspiring. We recycle and do as much as we can in our personal daily lives but you really realise that so much more needs to done, and we really are on a tight schedule.” Nearly two-thirds (64%) of Generation Z Americans want to work for employers committed to tackling climate change, according to research released today from international non-profit organisation the Climate Group. It surveyed more than 1,000 16- to 24-year-olds across the US to find out their views on climate change and how it will affect their future choices. Three in four young people (77%) feel climate change is an important issue that needs to be solved, with almost identical results for Democratic and Republican states (80% v 76%). With the US federal government actively rolling back pro-climate policies, for most young people the bulk of responsibility to solve the climate crisis rests on the shoulders of big US businesses and state governments alike (60% for big businesses v 69% for state governments). Four out of five (80%) support US companies adopting renewable energy in place of fossil fuels, with two in five (40%) believing they should be using 100% clean energy already. Two-fifths think the switch needs to be made by 2030 at the latest. Within the transport sector, two-thirds (66%) of young people would support the replacement of short-haul flights with cleaner alternatives, such as high-speed rail. Helen Clarkson, CEO of the Climate Group, which annually hosts Climate Week NYC, said: We need wholescale changes to economies and infrastructure to make pro-climate choices the new normal. It is in the interests of every business and government to sit up and listen to the next generation of workers and voters. We know through our initiatives for business on renewables, electric vehicles, and smart efficient energy and work with state and regional governments that good progress is being made in the US, but more needs to be done at a greater pace and scale. Demonstrations, marches, even open-air classes on environmental policy are planned in more than 40 Brazilian cities on Friday. And while numbers are likely to range widely – from 186 people who signed up for the Facebook event of a protest at 5pm in the southern city of Florianópolis to 12,000 promising to attend another at 4pm on São Paulo’s landmark Paulista Avenue, activists said the geographical spread of cities taking part shows how non-party, environmental activism is growing here. “We are talking to churches, unions, social movements,” said Yumi Kawamura, 45, a sociologist helping organise the São Paulo event, “looking to unite organisations with different agendas and find a common way forward.” In Rio de Janeiro, a protest at 10am outside the state legislature is aimed at children and young people. Another is scheduled for 2.30pm. Then at 4pm demonstrators hold an open-air class outside the headquarters of beleaguered environment agency Ibama - under attack from far-right president Jair Bolsonaro and his business-friendly environment minister, Ricardo Salles – before marching to the city centre. Events are being staged by the Rio Climate Coalition (Coalizão Pelo Clima Rio), an umbrella group of collectives. “It is very plural, it is horizontal, it is collective. It is aligned with the movement that Greta (Thunberg) started in Europe,” said Hanna Cordeiro, 31, an advertising executive and climate activist from the coalition. Brazil is one of the world’s deadliest countries for environmental defenders – one reason, Cordeiro said, why environmental demonstrations in Brazil are usually smaller here. Another is that pressing problems with poverty, crime, unemployment and a lack of basic sanitation obscure environmental issues for many Brazilians. “In Brazil it is jobs and housing. The environmental agenda is seen as more subjective. In Europe it is much stronger,” said José Oeiras, 57, a climate organiser for the leftist Workers’ party helping stage a demonstration at 4pm in the Amazon city of Belém. When the Amazon fires crisis exploded, Bolsonaro’s supporters flooded social media and WhatsApp with fake news – a report by the Publica journalism agency showed how automated Twitter accounts led attacks. The propaganda deluge echoed Bolsonaro’s unproven arguments that the blazes were started by foreign NGOs and foreign interest constituted an attack on Brazilian sovereignty. Such nationalist rhetoric has long resounded in the Amazon. “This is an old argument,” Oeiras said. “It’s a contradiction we need to overcome.” Fatima Zara Alarakha, 20, a campaigner for Islamic Relief UK and an arts student, marching on Millbank beside the Houses of Parliament in central London, said fighting climate change was imperative, given her beliefs: I’m here today because it is my duty as Muslim and a human. Allah entrusted us to look after the earth and it is our responsibility to do so. I’m striking today to represent my family in Pakistan whose houses are being flooded as a result of our overconsumption in the west. I’m also here to represent the future generations whose lives will be affected by the decisions we make. I want to bring children up in a world where they don’t have to suffer from majorly polluted air, decrepit housing and the health problems and poverty brought on by the climate crisis. Manisha Jeevan, 16, isn’t sure she is ready for her music exam tomorrow. But she decided to skip school because climate change is more important, she says. “If there is no earth then how will we live?” She is protesting near Lodhi gardens, Delhi, with her friend, Kushi, also 16. They worry about pollution in Delhi, about the failure to manage waste properly and about the increasingly hot weather. “It’s September. Our parents used to get winter in this month but we have not got winter. We are losing our seasons,” says Kushi. Rishika Singh, 18, a college student, worries about the damage that Delhi’s pollution is doing to her lungs. She says: I even bought a mask, but it’s not so easy to wear every day. The pollution that we see here, and the water here which has a lot of chlorine in it - it’s not good. It’s the poorest who suffer the most.The rich are better off - they make the use of air conditioning and private cars for comfort. It’s evening now in Delhi and, after an afternoon of chanting and banging drums, protesters have gone home. Nimrat Singh, 21, a law student, says people want action, not words, from their leaders. “We want the system to actually recognise climate change,” she says. New York City is anticipated to see one of the largest climate strikes today. Thousands of people are expected at the protest, which is being co-hosted by over two dozen local and national groups. Protesters plan to gather at a park outside New York’s City Hall and march a mile down to Battery Park, where Greta Thunberg is scheduled to speak in the afternoon along with other performers and speakers. In anticipation of the strikes, NYC’s Department of Education announced the absences of students in the district, the largest school district in the nation, will be excused on Friday with parental permission. In other words, 1.1 million students have been given the green light to attend the strikes if they want to. Many students have spent the last few weeks painting signs and banners in preparation. Before the march’s official start at noon local time (5pm BST), a rally honoring the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria will take place in downtown Manhattan. The central London rally, outside parliament, has heard speeches from Jeremy Corbyn and Caroline Lucas, with the Labour leader calling for tougher global environmental standards to prevent the import of products made overseas using harmful processes. From an open-top double-decker bus being used a stage, Corbyn told the crowd: So when we measure the effects of climate change emissions, let’s measure those emissions at the source, where they are created, and not put ourselves in some comfort zone, that we’re doing OK at the expense of somebody else. Corbyn also called for what Labour term a “green industrial revolution” – a version of the green new deal – to invest heavily in areas such as sustainable energy. That green industrial revolution can bring about, I believe, 400,000 decent, high-quality jobs. And with that we also have cleaner air, we have better quality of life, and we deal with many of the health inequalities that exist in this country. Beforehand, Lucas began by noting that in May parliament had passed a motion declaring a climate emergency. “So don’t ever let anyone tell you that you are not making a difference,” the Green MP told the crowd. “You are making history.” Calling it “the biggest social justice issue of our time”, Lucas said the government needed to make more urgent plans than the commitment of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. She said: The truth is that a climate target of net zero by 2050 is not climate leadership. When your house is on fire you don’t call 999 and ask for a fire engine in 30 years’ time. You want urgent action now. This is a striking picture, no pun intended, from Berlin. The translation of the sign held by “Merkel” reads: “Mother (Merkel) has failed, now it’s the turn of young people.” The Bishop of Wolverhampton, Clive Gregory, has asked all clergy members and lay employees within the Dioceses of Lichfield to set aside their usual duties today to focus instead on Climate Action activities. Gregory led a special service at Lichfield Cathedral to raise awareness about the climate crisis. Around 550 pupils and teachers from five West Midlands primary schools attended. Children from St Michael’s CE primary school in Lichfield arrived holding handmade signs and chanting “save our world”. My colleague, Ben Quinn, is in Westminster where climate strikers are heading towards Downing Street, but there is also a counter-demonstration by Jeremy Corbyn’s brother, and famed climate change denier, Piers. The German government today announced a new climate protection package costing €50bn, which was immediately criticised as lacking ambition by Fridays for Future protesters. At a press conference in central Berlin, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that as a scientist she had been impressed by Greta Thunberg’s motto “unite behind the science”. Following a marathon negotiation session, Merkel’s conservatives and her Social Democrat coalition partner detailed plans for increased purchase premiers for electric cars, and new taxes for traditional cars with emissions over 115mg. The measures include a ban on installing oil-fired heating in buildings from 2025, with a subsidy for householders prepared to switch to more climate-friendly alternatives. A price for emissions of carbon dioxide has also been agreed that will take effect via trading in emissions certificates. The package also includes new investment in rail networks, and promises of reduced fares. In a tweet, Fridays for Future criticised the plans: Dear government: if you spend years doing nothing for climate protection and then, after months of massive public pressure, discuss measures that have nothing to do with [the plan to halt global warming at] 1.5C, then that’s not a ‘breakthrough’ but a scandal. You can see some of the best pictures of the day here: Thanks for the excellent questions, which have ranged from science and politics to a plea from a deskbound worker – hang in there! – and thanks to you all for taking part in the debate over climate issues and solutions. Today’s climate strikes have sent a message round the world that will be heard in the highest echelons of politics and business, but which have also helped to spur public engagement with the solutions to the crisis that will be needed if we are to make the vast changes we must to avoid the worst ravages of climate chaos. On a personal note, today is almost exactly 15 years since I started writing full-time about the climate crisis, and related environmental issues, and although progress in that time has been grindingly slow in many ways, it has also been marked by sudden leaps forward. Improving public understanding and engagement is at the heart of making a better future. The messages from today are clear. This is not somebody else’s problem: it is ours. This is not a problem for the future: it is now. This is not an inevitable catastrophe: we can still make things much better. A noisy and good natured protest is being held in Bedford, with a few hundred protesters, including one dressed as a giant dinosaur, marching along the High Street at lunchtime shouting “what do we want, climate justice”, “no planet B” and “this is what democracy looks like”. The protest is being led by children from local schools, clearly drawing their inspiration from climate activist Greta Thunberg. Earlier, Bedford’s MP, Mohammad Yasin, addressed the crowd, saying he was sorry that politicians had let people down and pledging his support. One young protester addressing the crowd said: “We may only be 14 or 15 years old but we’re a force to be reckoned with.” Later, a die-in was held in Harpur Square in Bedford town centre. Indy Willaert, Liza, Fran Demeyer and Jana Bameils, all aged 13, have taken half a day off school to attend the climate march in Brussels. Not all their teachers are in favour. “Some of them are alright with it, but some of them would rather have us in class,” says Fran, who has already taken part in several school strikes. “That climate is more important ... You can always do [your work] after school,” adds Indy. Liza wants politicians to help make green choices easier, including reducing plastic waste. “We can only buy plastic because everything is in plastic. We want them to help us” They all agree with Jana that politicians are not doing enough. The four schoolgirls arrived from their home city of Ghent to join the climate march in Brussels, which started from the city’s North Station and will finish around the headquarters of the European Union. Along the route there was music, drum beating and chanting. Young people jumped up and down to the slogan: “Plus chaud, plus chaud, plus chaud que le climat” (Hotter, hotter, hotter than the climate). Stijn, a 28-year-old engineer, was missing work to join the protest. His employers “were not very happy about it but they couldn’t really make a fuss about it either,” he said. “Like the other side of my sign says there are no jobs on a dead planet so it is important to be here today.” His friend, Deniz Malat, 27, a recent plant biology graduate, feels people are being ignored by the government. “We want change and we are being ignored by the government - the politicians. We want to come together to show we are serious and they should consider what we are saying here.” People are also out in force in Poland. Ten-year-old Nellie Jacobs and her mother, Helen, had never protested before their hometown of Whaley Bridge made national headlines earlier this month. Nellie and her Dad were choosing books in the library of their quiet Derbyshire town when Helen called them in a panic to say its dam had burst and the whole neighbourhood could go under. Carrying a homemade placard saying “School strike for climate”, Nellie was allowed to take the day off school at Whaley Bridge primary to join the global strike in Manchester. She said: Everyone had to be evacuated and we raced for high ground. I was quite scared because we weren’t expecting it. We occasionally get police cars coming through Whaley for something that’s not in Whaley but we’ve not had crises in Whaley. I’m worried it might happen again. We weren’t used to that much rain so it made me worry and it made me think all this rain, we don’t get it usually so I thought that it was climate change that caused the rain. Her mother Helen Jacobs said she had never protested in her life but felt infuriated by the inaction of global leaders. She said: It’s kind of getting the politicians to realise that they’ve made a mistake in saying that it’s really nothing when it’s a really big problem and we need to act on it now. I thought if I got out here and did something then it might happen. It’s been building up a lot in my mind. The climate is under threat and it has been for a long time but the action doesn’t seem to have fit the imperative. We feel like we need to wake the government up, we need to wake world leaders up and make them realise that we need systematic massive change. We’re here and ready for change to bring the temperature down. We feel like we need to shake them by the collar to make them realise. The scientists are there telling them and still President Trump is denying climate change exists! Other leaders need to grab him, shake him, and get him on board. The whole world needs to get on this. In Aviemore, a town in the Cairngorms National Park, in the Scottish Highlands, strikes are taking place. We were sent another photograph of activity there today from Iain Gibson. Nick from Norwich asked: How can I join in the strike in a non-unionised office where no one cares about climate change without getting the sack? That is a tough one. Most companies will be affected by climate chaos in some way, however: extreme weather events are already costing billions a year and those costs are not coming down soon. Foresighted companies will audit the risks they face and act to deal with them. If you work for a publicly listed company, you could try buying some shares and turning up at the AGM to ask questions about how they are dealing with climate risk. If you don’t, more of your co-workers may be interested in the climate than you think: polls show a great majority of people in most countries are concerned about the climate crisis. Dan from Tunbridge Wells asked: How will we make our nuclear power plants safe if this civilisation collapses? How does the hydrological cycle fit in? Can regenerative agriculture help? Regenerative agriculture can help, and sustainable agriculture can reduce emissions, aid carbon storage and feed the world more healthily, as recent reports by the Lancet and WRI, among others, have shown. As for hydrology, the effects of climate chaos are likely to be the wet areas of the world getting wetter and the dry areas getting drier, which is problematic. And as for nuclear power, some people - including the Guardian’s George Monbiot - see it as an uncomfortable but perhaps necessary way out of the climate crisis, but the very long-term storage of nuclear waste is a problem still to be solved. Kee from London asked: How much impact do long-haul flights have? How does the impact compare with, say, driving a car, or using electrical household appliances every day? My colleague Niko Kommenda recently published an excellent calculator showing what impact flights have. Whether you can offset the emissions from such flights by cutting carbon in other aspects depends on how many flights you take and where to. Niko from Germany asked: What is your estimate on how much renewables capacity Europe needs to build to meet its climate targets? My rough guess is between 30-40 GW per year, that would equal about 600 wind turbines per month, that’s quite a challenge (other forms of renewables are of course available). The International Energy Agency and the European Environment Agency are the best sources. Stephen from Cheshire asked: Whatever happened to the plant a tree in ‘73 campaigns I grew up with in the 1970s? Surely now is a good time to kickstart this again with planting in every public space and private garden. Fruit trees also feed us and wildlife. I have planted hundreds of trees over the years. Ultimately, however, the planet is simply overcrowded. My wife and I chose to be child free so we’ve done our bit... I love the plant a tree in 73 campaign as I used to have some of the stickers! Planting trees is part of the UK government response but so far targets have been missed. Today my colleague Rowena Mason reports on an NHS tree planting campaign. Thousands of French youngsters skipped school to march through Paris. Claude Guyon, a cinema decorator and sculptor, was dressed as a Brazilian tribal leader and carried a “sacred rattle”. He said: I’m here to represent the guardians of the Earth from north and South America. The tribal leader, who is a woman, gave me this headdress so I could be here today as an ambassador for her. Primary school headteacher Scott McFarlane took the morning off work to attend the Middlesborough climate strike with his wife, who is also a teacher, and his nine-year-old son, who is a pupil at his school. During the strike, dozens of protesters staged a “die in” in the North Yorkshire town’s Centre Square – lying on the pavement for seven minutes to illustrate the rate at which it is believed species are becoming extinct. McFarlane allowed other children at Stokesley primary academy to take part in the strikes if they wished, giving them an “education other than at school” mark on the register. While not many took up the offer, he said the fact that so many young people seemed to be engaged with environmental activism had given him hope. “I think Greta Thunberg’s an absolute idol. We’ve got kids at school who last year were coming dressed as Ariana Grande, but have now changed their hairstyles to look like Greta,” said McFarlane. McFarlane, who is a member of Extinction Rebellion Teesside, said he and his son would be striking from the school next month for XR’s October Rebellion in London. “I am genuinely scared for the future of the human race. Not in the distant future but soon. We have to act,” he said. “If there’s any further action like today, I will always let children have the day off. Not everybody agrees and I’m not asking them to, really. But I hope our example is one that people are starting to take on board.” Of all the venues globally that will host climate strike protests today, none can surpass Miami Beach for poignancy. Florida’s poster-city for sea level rise will sink under seven feet of water by the end of the century, if scientists’ predictions are realised, and already it takes only a high tide and a rainy day to send floodwaters surging inland. These dark clouds are why student climate activists from all over South Florida will gather at Miami Beach city hall this morning to reinforce their message that more needs to be done. At the most recent youth strike in May, barely four dozen waved placards and called for action - but today students will walk out of their South Florida schools and assemble there in their hundreds to highlight the urgency of the moment. Gabriella Marchesani, a Miami high school senior and an organiser of today’s rally: We’re told by the adults, ‘what you’re doing is a good thing, keep up the great work’. But it shouldn’t be just ‘oh, keep doing what you’re doing’, it should be ‘let me see what I can do to help you. How can I be a climate voter? How can I switch my lifestyle to be more sustainable? How can I lower my carbon footprint?’ She adds: We want this to be that historic moment that we look back on and say that was the day we got it changed. That was the day we were able to make people hear us, and create legislation and address this crisis. Andreu from Valencia, Spain asked: According to scientists, the “natural evolution” of the sun will lead to major climate change here on the Earth. So, what role, if any, does solar activity (solar winds, solar flares, sunspots) play in climate change right now? Are we missing something, have we miscalculated or does the sun have nothing to do with climate change at this point? Changes in the sun’s activity are not causing the climate change and global heating we are currently experiencing. They are caused by human actions, chiefly burning fossil fuels and changing land use, as successive reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have conclusively shown. Alex from Warwickshire asked: The electrification of small vehicles is seen as an achievable near-term step towards cutting emissions, but to replace a significant fraction of the current fossil-fuelled fleet would presumably require a drastic increase in the global extraction and use of ‘rare-earth’ metals for battery manufacture. How well do we currently understand the environmental impact of such a change and are there more sustainable battery technologies on the horizon? In the long term, availability of rare earths will be an important issue but it is equally important to note that there are no serious current supply problems as the manufacturing rates show. Batteries are one of the biggest areas of research and there are multiple avenues being explored, from nanotechnology to graphene and even aluminium, a common metal, as an alternative. Hydrogen fuel cells are another possibility. Tracey from Ross-on-Wye asked: Guy McPherson, an environmental scientist, argues that, due to the protection from the sun’s heat attributable to global dimming, if we cut carbon emissions the Earth will heat faster, and the planet will be uninhabitable for any species within a decade. Why is this theory not spoken about or even mentioned by any other leading environmental voices? Because it is wrong. The dimming of light from the sun owing to aerosols does have a small effect, but as you seem to be pointing out, many of the aerosols are soot, or black carbon. Black carbon actually adds to warming, especially when it falls on snow. Removing black carbon and other short-lived climate pollutants could reduce temperatures by as much as 0.5C as work by Durwood Zaelke and others has clearly shown. You can share your questions now via our form here, or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they’ll be easier for us to find. Lyra Harris, six, from Islington, London, protesting outside 10 Downing Street, said: Stop this nonsense. Our Earth is getting too hot. We have to act now for everyone. It’s not just for humans, climate change harms the animals too. Over in Greece it is pupils who have been leading protests with hundreds pouring into Athens’ main plaza, Syntaga square. Ariadni, 15, holding a hand-drawn placard of a weeping planet under a halo of heat said: I am here to raise awareness. There’s not much time left. This is global. People need to be informed and they need to act now. Maria Makarem, the 16-year-old who had helped organise the strike said the protesters had ended up in front of the parliament to ram home the message that urgent times call for urgent measures. “They have to understand, all the politicians in there, that we are the new generation and we want change,” she said, her own placard proclaiming: “Our world, our future, our choice.” Yiannis Marangakis and Foivos Anastadiades, both aged 10 and both taken out of class by their mothers Daniella and Myrtia to attend the protest, had an even simpler message: “The earth is very important to us. We have to save it.” This shows the scale of the march in Edinburgh: Ian Mantgani, 36, is striking in London today. He says: We have to put pressure on our employers, MPs and friends. We need a new power grid and electric cars on the road or we’re toast. Keep pressuring those in power for concrete change and keep pressuring them when they give you mealy mouthed answers. I believe that’s the best way forward for change.” Chris from South Africa asked: Why are we not seeing a rise in sea levels? Could it perhaps partly be due to the fact that rainfall across the SAHEL region that is rapidly greening is 40m olympic swimming pools up on a few years ago? We are seeing a rise in sea levels. And sea levels alone are not the biggest problem: storm and tidal surges are much worse when sea levels are even slightly higher, with the power to overtop our sea defences. Desertification is increasing in many parts of Africa, with climate change one of the reasons but not the only one (overgrazing and land use changes also play a major role). Artur from Crewe asked: Are we prepared to do real things to tackle climate change? We can say do this or do that but our use of social media takes significant resources. The cheap food, cheap technology, new mobiles released every year is driven by customers not the other way around so how many are actually genuinely prepared to change their way of life? People are increasingly understanding that lifestyle changes are necessary, from veganism and flexitarian diets to changing our travel habits. Renewable energy such as wind and solar is already cheaper or on a par with fossil fuels in many areas, and its deployment is increasing fast. A Guardian reader from London who wanted to remain anonymous asked: How democratic is it that a secondary school threatens their pupils with being expelled if they participate in today’s strike? How are we teaching ‘British values’ to our kids if in their school are not allowed to protest for something that fully impacts their future? What will it be next? Forbid them to participate in any human rights support act? Schools will make their own judgment, but engaging children with a subject of huge importance in scientific, political and historical terms might strike many teachers as a great opportunity. The climate emergency relates to chemistry, physics, biology, geography, history, social studies – you could probably even fit it into a load of other lessons too. Why not see this as an opportunity to engage pupils rather than turn them off? Derek from West Sussex asked: The UK has a good record of deploying offshore wind generation. What I don’t understand is why we aren’t deploying wave power and tidal power generation? We have the most coastline per head of any major European country. Wave power never stops, unlike wind, it is more energy dense than wind, and it could have other benefits like reducing coastal erosion. Tidal power solutions likewise are always available and energy dense. There is an ecological cost in habitats but a balance is needed here. Do we really think that the ecological cost of a tidal barrier is worse than a nuclear power station? There is an ecological cost to farmland too, but we need to eat, so we cut down all the forests we had in medieval times to make room for agriculture. We just need to make some room for power generation too. The UK is a world leader on offshore wind, as the latest green power auctions show. Wave and tidal power have proved more difficult, in the latter case partly owing to the changes that would be required to landscape a tidal lagoon. But as public subsidy is less needed for wind and solar as prices have come down, it might become possible to spend more of it on wave and tidal power – they may prove cheaper than the high costs agreed to by the government for nuclear energy. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, received a warm applause at the city’s climate protest when he gave a speech pledging that “fracking is the past, it is not the future” – but by far the biggest cheers went to a 10-year-old girl called Lillia who took to the stage next. The local schoolgirl, with a high-pitched Mancunian accent and fluorescent ear-defenders tied to her backpack, gave a rousing speech taking aim at politicians for their “lies” – before turning directly to Burnham. Lies, when you don’t count the airport in the emission figures! Lies, when we have 1,200 air pollution related deaths in Manchester just last year – but they plan to build a huge car park right next door to a school in Ancoats. Lies when the pension funds of Manchester are still investing £1.4bn in fossil fuel companies … Lies, in April the mayor Andy Burnham, when I asked if he would support us. I asked for more than publicity stunt pictures. Where’s the action? To huge cheers, she continued: Today I woke up to the images around the world of a million people striking and my heart lifted because I knew we weren’t alone in our fight. Thank you for coming out to support us. Thank you for having the courage to fight for our future! To adults I say, you have the power to vote you need to keep amplifying our voices. We the youth cannot wait until we are old enough - we need action now. Numbers at Berlin‘s Klimastreik have reached 100,000, it has just been announced. Carola Rackete, the SeaWatch Captain who was arrested in Italy several weeks ago addressed Berlin’s Klimastreik, to huge applause. She told them: We adults are responsible for the fact that the Earth is dying ... we should not be under the illusion that our individual actions can ... turn the situation around. She paid tribute to “the children and young people who have campaigned tirelessly for over a year ... and managed to get this issue to the top of the political agenda”. She said temperatures could be expected to rise by 4-6C by the end of the century. Extinction Rebellion, to which she belongs, was telling the truth when it predicted the collapse of human civilisation as a result. We can no longer stop global heating, she said, “it’s too late”, but we can “reduce greenhouse gases with immediate effect”. Sarah from Cardiff asked: What are the advantages people will see and experience through the changes we need to make due to climate change? For example, I believe cycling rather than driving will make people healthier, shopping locally rather than online increases daily interactions. Do you envisage the activists and media managing to put this side of the crisis across? Cleaning up greenhouse gases has myriad beneficial side effects, including cleaner air as diesel and petrol cars are taken off the roads in favour of electric vehicles, public transport and walking or cycling. Our knowledge of the harms of air pollution has expanded dramatically in the past few years: we now know air pollutants can be found in all human organs, and it is linked not only to respiratory problems and heart disease but also dementia, developmental problems and miscarriage. In some ways, the cleaning up of air pollution is easier to explain than climate chaos because people can see and feel air pollution more clearly than the link between invisible carbon dioxide and extreme weather, and increasingly air pollution campaigners are making the link with climate benefits from moving away from coal and diesel in particular. Louis from London asked: Today is wonderful to see - the energy and passion - but how can you be sure we haven’t left it too late ? There is a climate doomosphere - I’m thinking Paul Beckwith, Peter Wadhams and others who suggest overwhelming events in the next decade or two. Can they be dismissed as fringe cranks? Climate change is a problem for today, not the distant future, and the effects are already being seen, as we have extensively reported. But there is still time to stave off the worst effects if we take action on emissions now. The IPCC has said emissions must be effectively zero by around mid-century to hold the world to no more than 1.5C of warning, and every effort to bring down emissions helps towards that goal. But there are scary things we know less about: tipping points, which could cause runaway heating to take hold. These include Arctic sea ice melt, which reveals dark sea instead of reflective ice, creating more warming, and the melting permafrost that releases methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, in a vicious circle. Some have suggested we turn our efforts to adapting to climate change instead of cutting emissions. But adapting without cutting emissions is like trying to mop up an overflowing sink with the taps still running. The truth is we need to do both, and urgently. You can share your questions now via our form here, or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they’ll be easier for us to find. Just to stand back from the breathless enthusiasm of the protests for a moment, our environment editor, Damian Carrington, has been pulling out a series of charts that highlight the scale of the challenge - and the beginnings of some solutions. Perhaps the most important one is this: the planet’s average temperature started a steady climb two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. We have also tried to capture this alarming rise in temperatures in a startling piece of music. Alas, it is not a banger, so is unlikely to become a global anthem for the Friday strikes movement. But it’s not all gloom and doom. The three charts below show the progress we have made, in renewable energy generation, electric vehicle production, and battery development. Today’s climate strikes highlight a crucial fact: that our actions in the next few years will decide the world’s future, and whether we can avoid the worst ravages of global heating or succumb to climate chaos. We must effectively eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, and nurture the natural world enough to absorb the remainder, by mid-century to avoid a future of catastrophic and irreversible climate chaos. Extreme weather is already driving 2 million people a week to seek humanitarian aid, and that is set to rise to 150 million in the next decade alone. The Guardian will try to answer your questions on the climate strikes and the forces shaping them. You can share your questions now via our form here, or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they’ll be easier for us to find. Guardian environment journalist Fiona Harvey will be on hand to answer any questions you have about the climate crisis between 1.30pm and 2.30pm BST.

The US is set to stage its largest ever day of protest over the climate crisis, with tens of thousands of students set to be joined by adults in abandoning schools and workplaces for a wave of strikes across the country. Climate strikes will take place in more than 1,000 locations, with major rallies in New York, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami. The young strikers’ totemic figure, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, will take part in the New York walkout and will speak to massed protesters in Manhattan. Authorities in New York City have announced that its student population of 1.1 million is allowed to skip school in order to attend the strikes. Dozens of companies, including Patagonia and Ben and Jerry’s, will support striking staff, with major unions also backing the walkouts. Dulce Belen Ceballos Arias, an 18-year-old from San Francisco, said she will be striking because “I want children of my own and I want them to have a better life than me. I don’t want that to be taken away by climate change.” Students in Boston will also be excused school, with a crowd of 10,000 expected to assemble. “We are excited to disrupt business as usual, to demand a Green New Deal,” said Audrey Maurine Xin Lin, an 18-year-old organizer in Boston, in reference to the resolution put forward by progressive Democrats to enact a second world war-style mobilization to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. A big difference on today’s march in London is the presence of trade union activists alongside young people and their parents, writes Guardian environment correspondent Matthew Taylor, Graham Petersen, from the UCU lecturers’ union and member of the green jobs alliance, said unions had to take a lead in the climate fight. This is going to be the defining issue for future generations and if we are not involved now how are we going to be relevant to the young people here today when they go into work. Trade unions around the world are backing today’s protests and Petersen said it was “about time” they engaged in the climate crisis. In the UK it is difficult because people have their hands full with austerity and precarious jobs but unions are starting to realise that if we get the climate justice policies right we can tackle not just the climate but also a wider social justice issues. Lois Borny has been speaking to young people on the London march, including student Noemie, who told her: It’s depressing knowing you’re waking up to not such a bright future. The climate crisis has always been in the back of my mind, but I always used to be a bit of a pessimist ... now that the movement has gained traction you get the feeling that you can change something. When asked what she thinks about the fact children are leading the movement she says: It almost seems like a game for them [the politicians]. They aren’t taking it seriously. This isn’t for fun or just for the sake of it. It’s real and urgent. It is Nazreen’s first day in London, having arrived from Malaysia yesterday. The 22-year-old, who is studying political philosophy, said: I’m happy this is happening because at home we have a big haze problem, because of forests being burned in Borneo. Nazreen says that if we were in Borneo, from where we are standing (by the stage) the Houses of Parliament would be unrecognisable from the haze. Borneo is burning. It has one of the oldest rainforest in the world and half of it is gone. We are really proud of our rainforests, but what is there to be proud of when it is gone? He says that it is good children are leading the movement, because it is allowing them to see “what is happening in the real world”. A small but noisy crowd gathered in the financial district of Sandton in Johannesburg, outside the offices of Sasol, a huge South African energy and chemical company. Natalie Kapsosideris, 16, said: We don’t really have a way out of this. The future looks really dismal at this point. There’s not going to be a lot of food available, there will be droughts, floods, natural disasters. The fact that Sasol gets away with stealing our future from us ... and it’s all because they want to make money. Tariro Banganayi, 18, a student at Sacred Heart college, said: It’s important that I lend my voice to this cause ... a lot of people who aren’t as privileged as I am don’t have the opportunity to speak out against these sorts of issues, who live where the air is unbreathable, where toxic waste is dumped in rivers, those people don’t have a voice to speak out ... Also I am here to educate people about these issues and to get as much information from as many different places as I can ... I am going to try to diversify the way that I raise awareness ... I am going to use my social media a lot more effectively, I am going to centre my conversations with my friends, I am going to bring it up at the dinner table with my family ... because if every person tells one person then we can tell everybody. Crowds of students in Delhi are blocking the road near to Lodhi Gardens, chanting: “What do we want? Climate justice.” “You can’t run away from climate change,” reads one sign. Delhi is one of 21 cities predicted to run out of groundwater by 2020, according to the Indian government’s policy thinktank, Niti Aayog. It is also one of the most polluted cities in the world.“The lungs of an 11 year old have black spots on them,” Shivam, a law student, says. “This is why we have to change things now.” In Exeter, the protest is in full swing. Leon Hayton-Twigg, 11, (pictured below with his brother Lucas and his friend Ossian Finn, 10) says: “We have come here to show the people there’s a problem and we want it to stop.” More of the protest signs from the Exeter strikes ... Archie Graham, 15, and his friends were supposed to be in school today but felt compelled to join Manchester’s climate strike, while still rocking their school ties. He said: What’s the point in going to school if we can’t use that knowledge in the future because there won’t be a future for us. His friend, Sam Pembroke, added: It’s really important because there’s no second chance - this is the only chance we have. If this carries on it’s just going to end. Their friend, Santana Daza, 15, said they might get in trouble for bunking off school but it was worth it: I think it definitely does make a difference. They encourage us to learn about it but we all know about climate change - we don’t need to be educated about it, it’s more about taking action. Herding a group of six placard-carrying children, Kitty Rostron, 40, said her seven-year-old daughter Margot watches Greta Thunberg on YouTube and asks: Why is this happening? Why is Boris Johnson not doing anything? Why do people not make good decisions about climate change? Her friend Karine Joshua, 39, said it was important to bring children along so they understand what is happening to the environment: There’s a real crisis right now, not in 10, 20 years time. Action is needed now so we’re trying to teach them if we come together and show our support hopefully we can make a change. Here is a selection of images from other climate strikers: Hello, this is Haroon Siddique taking over from Sarah. The video below shows a small proportion of the staff who walked out at the Guardian. If you want to get in touch, please tweet me @Haroon_Siddique The Guardian live blog will be closing from noon (12:00 BST) until 12.30 BST as we are participating in a solidarity strike. When it resumes, my colleague Haroon Siddique will be taking over. In an email to staff explaining why we are walking out for 30 minutes, Guardian editor in chief, Katharine Viner, said: We fully support this global campaign, and we want colleagues to feel able to show solidarity with campaigners - so we are happy to support this activity across the organisation. Sadiq Khan is not the only mayor who has come out strongly behind today’s strikes. The leaders of Paris, New York City, Los Angeles and Copenhagen released a strongly worded joint statement overnight. Our shared planet is facing a climate emergency. The science is clear that, without urgent action, sea levels will rise further, extreme temperatures will become the norm and climate-related disasters will inflict even greater damage. We are making historic investments to prepare and adapt our cities to the inevitable consequences of emissions already released into the atmosphere. When your house is on fire, somebody needs to sound the alarm. Young people in our cities, displaying incredible maturity and dignity are doing just that. School children are taking to the streets, drawing attention to the terrifying threat that climate breakdown poses to their future. Young people recognise just how unfair climate change is. Those who have generated the least greenhouse gas emissions, including the poorest, most disadvantaged and youngest in society, will suffer the worst effects of a rapidly changing global climate. They are right to sound the alarm, and they are right to demand action that tackles climate change and inequality simultaneously. On September 20, these inspiring young leaders have called for adults to join them for a Global Climate Strike. We have an opportunity to show, not only that we hear their message, but that they have inspired us to act even faster. As mayors, our greatest responsibility is to protect the lives and wellbeing of those that live in our cities. As adults, our obligation is to leave the world in a better state for our children than we inherited it. Fortunately, the evidence is increasingly clear that transforming our cities to prevent the climate crisis will also make them healthier, more equitable, safer and ultimately better places to live. The cities of the future will enjoy affordable and reliable public transport; the air will be free from poisonous toxins; buildings will generate zero emissions thanks to ultra-high efficient heating, cooling and insulation; waste will be recycled or reused, and all of this will be powered by abundant renewable energy. We have a unique opportunity to bestow a bright and hopeful legacy to the next generation. This is the future we want. That is why we are supporting the Global Climate Strikes. Mayors around the world, working through C40 Cities, are committed to deliver on the Paris Agreement and taking action to peak their emissions as our cities already have and bring them down sharply by 2030. Many businesses, investors, labour groups, faith leaders and local communities share our urgency. But we cannot tackle the climate crisis alone. We need science-based action from every sector of the economy, and we expect greater leadership from nation states. Young people are telling us that the climate emergency demands an emergency response. We couldn’t agree more. It was signed by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, as well as the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, and the lord mayor of Copenhagen, Frank Jensen. Lovely thread by Mary Hamilton on what to do if you cannot make the strikes today but still want to make an effort to reduce your waste. Ruby, 10, and Dougie, 7, (pictured below), were the first to start striking outside the Scottish parliament, back on a cold dark 11 January. Back then it was just them and the police. Seeing how big the movement has become, Ruby says she feels “happy and proud”. “Amazing,” says Dougie. Staff at the Guardian will be striking today at noon, so there will be no posts on the live blog between 12:00 BST and 12:30 BST. The fashion industry is a fossil-fuel-guzzling operation, as many of our clothes are made from petroleum-based textiles such as polyester. Even natural fibres such as cotton have a huge carbon footprint and require a large portion of the world’s pesticides. In a bid to solve this disastrous environmental equation, scientists and designers are creating completely new textiles from fast-growing, carbon-sucking organisms such as micro- and macro-algae, mycelium (elements of fungus), bacteria and fermented yeast. These new biotechnologies efficiently convert sunlight and CO2 into mass raw materials, suck carbon out of the atmosphere and pave the way to a carbon-negative wardrobe. Tens of thousands of young people and adults are already streaming into the streets around Westminster in central London, and organisers say the protest, which was formally due to start at 11am, already dwarfs previous school strike demonstrations. Among those gathered in the sunshine were a group of medics. Isobel Braithwaite, a public health doctor from London, said they were there because the climate crisis was also a health crisis: “From heatwaves to floods; food shortages to devastating storms, these things are having a huge impact on health now and it is going to get worse.” She said it was time adults listened to young people who had taken the lead in addressing this crisis. “We need urgent widespread action and it must happen quickly... we are running out of time.” Glorious scenes in Edinburgh as thousands of children, parents, students and musicians gather at the Meadows for the Climate Strike. “This is our Earth and our future. We need to take care of it,” said 11-year-old Leila Koita, pictured here with friends Eilidh Tedesco, Norah Turner, Tilly Torrie, Megan Berger and Nan Zhang. Norah’s mum, Jo Spencely, says she hasn’t been on a demo for decades but she is here to show support. “I’m massively concerned about their future. I almost can’t bear to read about the climate. It’s so scary.” The march sets off at 11:30am and will pass through Edinburgh city centre and end with a rally in front of the Scottish parliament. As in London, police have imposed restrictions, in this case by refusing permission for the marchers to walk down Princes Street. As elsewhere, this is just the start of a week of climate action. On Saturday, activists will stage a “die in”, Monday will be a “day of disruption”, musicians will join a “Love the Planet festival” on Wednesday, and there’ll be another rally outside parliament the following day. Even Emmeline Pankhurst has joined in the protests in Manchester. A statue of the suffragette hero has donned a bright orange lifejacket and has a placard that asks: “Ready for rising sea levels to reach this height?” The stunt was the idea of Katie Bradshaw and Ryan Griffiths, both 31, who described themselves as first-protesters who felt the need to act today. “Emmeline still carries that Mancunian spirit of standing up for what she believes in and great causes,” said Griffiths. “Climate change is so important and we think it’s an issue she would be at the forefront of if she were around today.” Bradshaw added: “We’ve got to do our bit, even if it’s just putting some signs up and making people realise we need to look after our planet. If she was around today she’d be supporting it.” Friends of the Earth, an international network of environmental organisations in 74 countries, is calling on people across Britain to join young people in striking against climate change. Muna Suleiman, a Friends of the Earth campaigner, said: Most of us want to fix the climate crisis. And it can be done. But we need our politicians to act. Climate breakdown is already hurting people around the world, with many of those who have contributed least to the crisis being subjected to the harshest impacts. “And right when we need our leaders to step up, they continue to let us down. From filling the skies with more planes, to backing fracking in the UK and funding oil and gas projects abroad. “That’s why we’re standing shoulder to shoulder with young people to call on our politicians to deliver emergency climate action now. And we’re asking everyone to join us.” Bob Dylan’s Blowin’ in the Wind kicks off Berlin’s “Klimastreik” to huge cheers from the thousands gathered, although no official estimates of the numbers attending are available yet. Contender for banner of the day is: ‘Grandpa what is a snowman?’ Hundreds of people are streaming through the portals of the Brandenburg Gate, through the Tiergarten Park and from every direction onto Platz des 18. März. Lots of Berlin’s young are here with the blessing of their parents and teachers, though many have defied their schools to be here. At 1pm, the student strikers are planning to let off alarm clocks across the UK, and are encouraging businesses to set off their fire alarms at the same time in support. Jake Woodier, the campaign co-ordinator at UK Student Climate Network, said: “Young people across the world have taken the lead in highlighting the need for urgent climate action over the past year. “They are calling for adults to join them for the global climate strike, just three days before the UN climate action summit to pressure our governments to act to tackle the climate crisis. “Raise the Alarm will help draw attention to the climate emergency in workplaces across the breadth of the UK,” Woodier said. Students at Torquay Girls’ Grammar school have made a video about climate change. What’s the carbon footprint of my trip? The square outside Manchester’s grand central library has been taken over by a sea of people carrying homemade placards and chanting. Hundreds of those gathered sang “Whose planet? Our planet!” with scores of children among the protesters. Nellie Jacobs, 10, and her mother Helen said they were motivated to take part in the global climate strike after their hometown Whaley Bridge was evacuated earlier this month when it was deluged with months-worth of rain in a short period, causing a dam to burst and dozens of properties to flood. Nice cartoon just in from reader Jesse Leonard. You get the picture, literally. Possibly the first time the climate crisis has been likened to a purple piano, but why not? If there are any other artists out there with climate emergency sketches/drawings/cartoons, send them in via this link. The Kichwa tribe in the Sarayaku region of the Amazon in Ecuador believe in the “living forest”, where humans, animals and plants live in harmony. They are fighting oil companies who want to exploit their ancestral land. A delegation of indigenous people are at the Paris COP21 climate conference to make sure their voices are heard. Can they win their battle? Tweeting a photo from a climate strike, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: Kate Connolly, the Guardian and Observer’s Berlin correspondent, has been out this morning in the German capital. Strikes are planned for at least seven Nigerian cities, such as Lagos, which is clogged by mountains of toxic waste including thousands of tons of e-waste from the EU, particularly the UK and Germany. There will be a protest in Port Harcourt, capital of the country’s oil-producing region, whose residents and their possessions have been covered in soot for the past few years, believed to be the result of destroying illegal oil refineries. There will also be two protests against a proposed coal plant in San Pedro in Ivory Coast, while in Ghana, a group called Young Reporters for the Environment is leading a march from the city hall of the capital, Accra. Next Friday, there will be a demonstration in Kumasi, the capital of Ghana’s Ashanti region. Ghana is losing its rainforests faster than any other country, with a 60% increase in primary forest loss from 2017 to 2018. In Senegal, there are marches in Rufisque and Thies this Friday, a climate camp in Kaolack on Sunday, followed by a demonstration against a new coal plant in Bargny, and a march in the capital, Dakar on the 27th. Air pollution in Dakar is causing more and more respiratory problems, in large part because of “dirty”, sulphur-laden diesel. Environmental activists Greta Thunberg and George Monbiot have helped produce a short film highlighting the need to protect, restore and use nature to tackle the climate crisis. Berlin’s main transport line, the S-Bahn, has virtually ground to a halt this morning due to a major engineering breakdown leaving many protesters stranded and unable to reach the protest. Participants are being encouraged to take their bikes instead. Many have pointed out the irony. Meanwhile, at the Brandenburg Gate, scene of the main protest in Berlin that is due to kick off just before noon, protesters have been organised into neat blocks. Apart from the huge crowds of protesters, the other uplifting piece of climate news today is that onshore wind has just became the cheapest source of energy in the UK. Industry analysts can’t believe how quickly the price has fallen. This shows the transition away from fossil fuels is much more affordable than people dared hope five years ago. On the business side of things, also encouraging to note efforts by companies with a green reputation, who seem to be competing to do more by selling less. The Patagonia outdoor clothing store will close all its European outlets today and next Friday so staff can join the protests. Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Lush also shutting today. Burton, the winter sports chain, is giving workers a paid day off to join the strike and have halted online sales for 24 hours. The company’s webpage today reads “Closed for business. Open for action. Let’s protect our playground.” In London, where big crowds are expected to gather near Westminster from 11am, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has thrown his weight behind today’s strikes. He told the Guardian this morning he fully supports schools across the city who are “working with pupils and allowing them time, without sanction, to peacefully and lawfully join the strikes today”. “It is unbelievable that we need strike action for the future of our planet to be taken seriously by government’s around the world,” he said. “I fully support the thousands of young people peacefully and lawfully protesting around the country today who feel so strongly about the climate change emergency and I share their frustration. The stark reality is we are running out of time for meaningful change. The climate crisis is one of the very biggest challenges we face – I have declared a climate emergency in London – and governments around the world are failing to take the action we need.” Berlin has kicked off its Fridays For Future this morning with road blockades, cycle rallies and a demonstration in front of the cuboid chancellery of Angela Merkel, where about 40 young people have unfurled a banner asking: “Return of the climate chancellor?” It’s an appeal to Merkel, once environment minister, to live up to the reputation she is seen to have squandered over everything from her support of the car industry to her refusal to back a phase-out of brown coal mining. They are keen to pressurise her coalition government ahead of the launch of its much-awaited package of climate emergency measures which the cabinet has spent the night negotiating and is due to launch early this afternoon. The protesters are chanting: ”Wir sind hier, wir sind laut, weil Ihr uns die Zukunft raubt.“ –“We are here and we are loud, because you’re stealing our future”. The main protest at the Brandenburg Gate is due to start just before noon. When there is protest in Berlin, there is usually also techno, and from 3pm a “Rave Rebellion” march will depart from Potsdamer Platz square, under the motto “No Future No Dancefloor”. Extinction Rebellion has announced plans to block traffic at strategic points “where it will hurt drivers” around the capital. Elsewhere, 400 protests have been announced across the country, which will likely attracts adults as well as children. An umbrella organisation that includes organisations such as “Psychologists for Future”, “Entrepreneurs for Future” and “Grandparents for Future” has called for people to join in, as has the services union Verdi and the German Protestant Church. “We stand side by side with Fridays for Future”, said Annette Kurschus, the president of the Protestant Church of Westphalia, “Planet Earth does not belong to us, it has only been entrusted in our care”. Germany has two faces when it comes to the environment: the country that prides itself in its high recycling rates, phasing out nuclear power and pioneering renewable energies is still the world’s sixth biggest pollutant, with 865m tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2018. Borne out of this realisation, much of the recent debate in the country has focused on the phase-out of the country’s approximately 130 smoke-belching coal plants. The government wants to close them down by 2038 – too soon for many unions, especially in the coal-rich east, and too late for climate activists galvanised by Fridays for Future. In Europe’s “car nation”, air pollution through exhaust fumes is another contentious issue, with some cities having introduced driving bans for diesel cars last year. The Fridays for Future protests have had a tangible effect on the political climate, with several polls earlier this year showing the Green party emerging as the strongest political force in the country. Many other parties have tried to copy its message, with even the arch-conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union calling for a coal phase-out by 2030, bans on plastic bags and new wind farms. Angela Merkel’s coalition government is expected to announce a plan for tackling climate change, rumoured to involve €75bn of investment by 2030, just in time for Friday’s climate strike. The planet’s average temperature started a steady climb two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. Heatwaves, droughts and floods are likely in the future if urgent action isn’t taken to stop climate change, experts warn. It comes as strikes take place across the world on Friday, calling on governments to take immediate action on climate change. The demonstrates have been planned ahead of the landmark UN climate action summit in New York on 23 September World leaders will discuss how they can reduce their carbon emissions with the aim of stopping global temperature rise from exceeding 1.5°C under the Paris agreement. Prof Nigel Arnell, professor of climate system science at the University of Reading: This week, the United Nations general assembly will be discussing how to encourage countries to be more ambitious in their targets to reduce future emissions of greenhouse gases. It’s clear that increased effort is needed if we are to avoid significant climate change impacts. We’re probably already seeing some of the consequences of climate change – heatwaves, wildfires, unusually slow and intense hurricanes – and things will get much worse if we continue on our current path of increasing emissions. We recently published a study showing the number of people exposed to major heatwaves would increase from 330 million per year now to up to 8 billion per year in 2050 – just 30 years away - the number people exposed to drought would increase from 400 million per year to up to 1 billion per year, and the number of people affected by flooding from major rivers would increase from 15 million per year now to up to 100 million per year. Reducing emissions now will reduce these impacts, but at the same time we also need to increase efforts to enhance resilience to the impacts that are inevitable following our emissions so far.” Keith Shine, regius professor of meteorology and climate science at the University of Reading: We are coming to the end of another decade. Each of the past four decades has, when averaged over the whole planet, been 0.1 to 0.2 degrees celsius warmer than the decade before; carbon dioxide levels have continued their relentless rise; and methane levels have grown much more rapidly than in the previous decade. Unless things start to change markedly over the coming decade, it is going to get harder and harder to meet the goals of the UN’s Paris agreement on climate change.” Protests taking place in Johannesburg, South Africa’s biggest city and capital of Gauteng province. The Guardian environment journalist Fiona Harvey will be on hand to answer any questions you have about the climate crisis between 1.30 and 2.30pm BST. You can share your questions now via our form here, or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they’ll be easier for us to find. With hundreds of thousands of children joining the global youth strike in cities around the globe, Extinction Rebellion UK said it stands in solidarity with all those striking. Caspar Hughes, 48, a Extinction Rebellion activist and father of school striker Max, 12, said: “Parents have left their children to clear up the climate and ecological crisis they have created. The youth should be out partying rather than protesting.” Extinction Rebellion activists will join the strikes in London and are holding their own actions and performances. At 2.30pm, a concert will take place in Victoria Tower Gardens, London. Jonathan Watts, the Guardian’s global environment editor, has written about young activists calling for north-south solidarity to the tackle climate emergency. He writes: While previous generations failed to notice the slowly shifting baselines, today’s young will watch the sixth great wave of extinction accelerate before their eyes. Due to warming seas and acid bleaching, coral reef systems will flicker out one by one. Species that existed for millions of years will tip into the abyss. Among those closest to the edge are the black rhino, the Chinese giant salamander, the Siberian crane, the Western gorilla, the Ganges dolphin, Bactrian camels, Pygmi sloths and Attenborough’s long-beaked echidna. Thousands of species of insects, plants and amphibians may go extinct before they are discovered. For many young people today, their only chance of seeing unspoiled beaches, savannahs, reefs and forests will be on old documentaries, 3D interactives or their grandparents’ holiday videos. Picturesque landscapes that defined communities and nations will be transformed. Read the full article here. The climate change strikes have spread far and wide, including the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. By William Yang in Taipei In Taiwan, dozens of representatives from primary schools, high schools, and universities gathered in the capital, Taipei, to launch a petition called “Fridays for the future”. The aim of it is to press candidates in the upcoming presidential election to lay out concrete policies to mitigate climate change risks that Taiwan faces. Some held signs that said: “It’s getting hot in here” and “Don’t drop it like it’s hot”, after popular song lyrics. Student activists spoke on stage, sharing their personal reasons for joining the global campaign to fight climate change. Wei Hung-zhan, aged nine, said: “Our future has been sacrificed by the older generation.” He asked: “Why hasn’t the older generation remembered to share earth’s resources with the next generation?” Students said that they planned to mail their petitions to each presidential candidate’s office and ask politicians to provide complete responses to their demands through online live-broadcasts in a month. The event’s organiser Chang Li-Wen said: “The only candidate who cares about Taiwan’s future is the person who proposes a complete set of climate change policies.” Over the next week, a series of climate change events are scheduled across Taiwan, including major rallies in Taipei and Kaohsiung on 27 September. People are taking to the streets in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, in southern Asia. Climate change in Bangladesh is a pressing issue. According to National Geographic, Bangladesh is one the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change. Millions are marching across the globe in what could be the largest climate protest in history. The first of the worldwide protests took place in Australia, where an estimated 300,000 people gathered at more than 100 rallies calling for action to guard against climate change. Other demonstrations were held across parts of Asia. In the UK, children and young people across the country will walk out of lessons and lectures They will be joined by hundreds of thousands of workers. The school strikes movement was sparked by the teenage activist Greta Thunberg who demonstrated at the Swedish parliament. The first large-scale protests of Friday’s “global climate strike” took place in Sydney and Canberra, with demonstrators calling on leaders in Australia, the world’s largest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas, to take more drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Similar rallies are planned for around the world, with 800 events set to take place in the US and 400 in Germany. The protests come ahead of a climate summit at the UN next week convened by the secretary general, António Guterres, to urge countries to up their climate efforts. Much stronger measures are needed across the globe to prevent temperature rises of more than 1.5C (2.7F) or 2C (3.6F) to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “It is unbelievable that we should need global strike action for the future of our planet to be taken seriously. The stark reality is that our climate is changing rapidly and we are running out of time to address it. “I hope governments around the world who are failing to take action hear the voices of millions of people, young and old, unified in their call for action to save our planet. Our future depends on it.” The level of CO2 has been rising since the industrial revolution and is at its highest for about 4 million years. The rate of the rise is even more striking – the fastest for 66m years – with scientists saying we are in “uncharted territory”. Strikes are also taking place in Uganda, east Africa. They are also under way in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. Events in Italy will be held throughout the coming week, culminating with demonstrations in more than 100 cities on Friday 27 September. “Italian schools only went back last week and we needed some time to plan and mobilise, so we voted to hold the major demonstrations on the 27th,” said David Wicker, a representative of the Turin branch of Fridays for Future Italia. More than 470,000 people took part in the first global climate strike in Italy on 15 March and a similar number is expected to join next week’s demonstrations. Though Italy’s greenhouse gas emissions have been decreasing over the past decade, the country was criticised this year by the European Climate Foundation for failing to provide an adequate plan to further reduce emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. Activists are hoping Italy’s new left-leaning coalition will take concrete action and fulfil its pledge of making environmental issues a priority. “They need to entirely cut the subsidies and investments going to the fossil fuel industry,” said Wicker, aged 14. “And we need to start immediate investment in green energy to help society have an ecological transition.” Young activists for Fridays for Future in Turin, one of the most polluted cities in Europe, have been holding the local authority to account over its environmental policies. “The town hall gives us feedback every two months and we give this information to scientists, who will say whether anything is really being done or not,” said Wicker. Emmanuel Macron’s government has set the object of making France carbon-neutral by 2050. However, greenhouse gas emissions have risen in the country since 2015, and in 2017 were said to be 7% above official targets. Climate change activists say Macron has gone back on promises. Sceptics doubt claims the government would renovate 500,000 buildings a year to use less energy and are angry at what is seen as bowing to the powerful agriculture lobby over pesticides. Meanwhile, it is the mainstream centre-right that has proven most resistant to Greta Thunberg’s appeals. The announcement that the Swedish teenager was to address the French assemblée nationale in July provoked outbursts of indignation and insults from opposition MPs. “Don’t expect me to be applauding a prophet in short trousers,” tweeted one. Others appealed for a boycott of her address. Le Monde pointed out French climate change sceptics were no longer attacking the message but the messenger and pointed to a “smear campaign” against Thunberg. After a slow start – an action that involved only 150 protesters in February in Nantes, reports suggest 56 organisations, ecology associations and social rights groups in France plan to demonstrate on Friday and Saturday. Youth for Climate France has organised a number of marches across France, and youngsters cave called on adults to join their action. They urged citizens: “Strike for the climate, which means above all leave your home, your office, your farm or your factory. Smashing the status quo requires the involvement of everyone: sportsmen and women, actors, teachers, food industry workers, psychologists, delivery people, it doesn’t matter. Whatever our position, we can all bring our stone to the building by refusing to accept the status quo.” In Paris, a march will begin at Place de la Nation and finish with a gathering at Parc de Bercy with workshops, conferences and “citizens’ meetings”. Several French unions including the powerful CFDT and CGT have issued calls for joint mobilisation. The action group Libérons le Louvre (Liberate the Louvre) is planning an action at the museum in protest at its long-standing partnership with the petrol group Total. Last year, black-clad members of the ecology association 350.org lay down in one of the Louvre’s galleries in protest at Total’s financial support of the museum, which dates back more than 20 years and which Louvre officials say has funded “exhibitions, renovations, educational and cultural activities and social actions”. Among the specific demands of French climate activists is that the French national education system introduces the teaching of the “environmental situation” and that France and the European Union officially declare a state of “climate, environmental and social” emergency. In France, a second day of protests on Saturday is planned to mark World CleanUp Day. A government minister said he cannot endorse children leaving school to take part in the climate strikes. Minister for business, energy and clean growth Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Breakfast on Friday that he supported the “energy and creativity” of students but said time spent in school was “incredibly important”. When asked if the government was listening to the young protesters, he said: “Their voices are being heard ... What I do support is their energy, their creativity, and the fact that they have completely mastered these issues and take them very seriously. “I am not going to endorse people leaving school because I think education, time spent in school is incredibly important.” Here are the final exclusive Twitter figures for the climate strike in Australia. And this is what the school strike conversation has looked like on Twitter in the past three days leading up to today’s demonstrations: There is a lot planned for South Africa today, with demonstrations in Johannesburg, the commercial capital, on the south-eastern coast in Durban, in Pretoria, and in Cape Town, where there’ll be a march on parliament. Ayakha Melithafa, 17, said she would be joining the global strike in Cape Town.The march won’t start until early afternoon to allow students to finish most of the school day. “We’ll be marching to parliament to demand that the government take this issue seriously. It needs to declare a climate emergency here in South Africa, and a moratorium on coal, gas and oil mining licences. They have just ignored the problem so far,” Melithafa said. South Africa is one of the continent’s most developed economies and relies heavily on coal powered energy generation. It is building new and very big coal-fired power stations. “We have arranged with our teachers to leave early. it is up to us. We are the leaders of today. We don’t just want the system to change. We want a brand new system which will help us live sustainably with a bright new future,” Melithafa said. A roundup of what is happening around Europe on Friday: France Youth for Climate France has organised a number of marches across the country, and youngsters cave called on adults to join their action. In Paris, a march will begin at Place de la Nation and finish with a gathering at Parc de Bercy with workshops, conferences and “citizens’ meetings”. A second day of protests on Saturday are planned to mark World CleanUp Day. Italy More than 470,000 people took part in the first global climate strike in Italy on 15 March and a similar number is expected to join next Friday’s demonstrations. Germany Nearly 500 climate change demonstrations are planned across Germany on Friday. In Berlin, several demonstrations will take place throughout the day. The Fridays for Future gathering starts at noon at the Brandenburg Gate under the motto: “Everyone for the climate.” Organisers expect 10,000 people. Why is this week important? The strikes take place ahead of the UN general assembly and the climate action summit on 23 September. The summit will bring together governments, the private sector, civil society, local authorities and other international organisations to develop ambitious solutions. The world’s leaders will converge on New York for the assembly, where each is given an (unenforced) time limit of 15 minutes to speak in front of the green marble podium. Leaders occupy positions in the hall in alphabetical order by country name, usually with a different nation occupying the first seat each year. General assembly week usually makes news in the first day or two, when the US president and other powerful heads of state tend to have their moment, and then attention tends to tail off. For that reason, there is always some horse trading before the general assembly week, with prime ministers from big countries trying to swap speaking slots with presidents of small countries.

Activists on bicycles block traffic at Ernst-Reuter-Platz square in Berlin, Germany, as they take part in the global climate strike today. There will be a “special takeover” of Channel 4’s usual evening weather report today, as the network joins the world’s largest climate strike. The channel’s social media accounts will also join the walkout, bosses said, and will be going on strike between 9.30am and 5.30pm. Additionally, continuity announcers will share facts drawn from World Meteorological Organisation research throughout the day on Channel 4. No details were given on the nature of the weather forecast’s “special takeover”. Across Britain, thousands will take part in a march. Worldwide, campaigners say there are more than 3,400 events planned in 120 countries, with numbers taking part expected to surpass the estimated 1.6 million people who took part in the global strike in March. The outdoor apparel brand Patagonia is closing every store worldwide to encourage employees and customers to join the climate strike. Demonstrators from more than 150 countries are expected to put pressure on governments and decision-makers to do more about climate issues. The strikes come ahead of the United Nations climate change summit, which begins on 23 September. While in the UK and many other countries the strike is taking place today, in some countries such as Italy and the Netherlands the strike is happening next Friday, 27 September. Explaining the decision to close stores, Ryan Gellert, the general manager, EMEA, Patagonia, said: “The climate crisis is a human issue – affecting all of us ... As a global business, we will be closing our stores on 20 and 27 September, striking with the youth activists and calling for governments around the world to take action.” The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will today thank young people for educating the world about the climate crisis. Speaking at the youth climate strike, Corbyn will also criticise the prime minister, Boris Johnson, for calling global warming a “primitive fear”. He is expected to say: To the young people leading by example today here and across the world, I want to say thank you: thank you for educating us about the climate crisis and the emergency of species extinction and biodiversity loss. I know the situation can look bleak. We have a prime minister that has called global warming a ‘primitive fear without foundation’. The US president is a full-blown climate denier, putting our planet in danger by pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. And the Amazon is on fire, looted by big corporations with a Brazilian president watching on who doesn’t care. But when we see young people demanding urgent action, it’s an inspiration. When I see this movement growing – and it’s growing every day – I know we can tackle the climate emergency. The next Labour government will welcome your pressure and hear your demands for change. We will kick-start a green Industrial revolution and protect our planet, so it’s there to give life and joy to generations to come.” I will be picking up the live blog from the Guardian’s London offices. Please share any photographs or comments from where you are with me: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com I’ll be handing over the blog now to my colleague Sarah Marsh. There are still hundreds of places, thousands of students and hours of protest to come. Stay with us as the strikes sweep across Asia, Africa and Europe, and into the Americas. There will also be plenty more Australian news and analysis to come. To recap what we’ve seen across Asia and the Pacific today: At least 300,000 people have taken part in the largest climate strike across Australia yet. Melbourne’s event drew 100-150,000 people, and Sydney’s 80-100,000. Hobart’s 22,000 attendees made it Tasmania’s biggest ever strike action. Hundreds of regional centres joined in – from Alice Springs, Byron Bay and Katherine. As part of Guardian Australia’s coverage, the federal energy minister, the opposition energy spokesman and two of the country’s biggest energy companies took questions from students. In Vanuatu, the deputy prime minister spoke directly to the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand as countries “to blame for this threat to our survival”. Protests also unfolded in the Solomon Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, India, Pakistan and more. As our Australian coverage wraps up, here’s a great round-table discussion from some Brisbane students. They’ve finally started marching in Melbourne. And here’s our video wrap of the thousands on the streets today. More from Lisa Cox in Melbourne Edie Shepherd, a Wiradjuri and Noongar woman, spoke to the crowd earlier. She said she’d recently visited communities in the Lake Woods region in the NT, an area that gas companies are proposing to frack. “While Lake Woods usually flows with water, this time it ran dry,” she said. As well as students, unions are here today. Sam Davis is a member of the National Union of Workers and was here with his young family. “We want to show that climate justice is very important to workers as well. A lot of our workers are going to be impacted by climate change in the near future too,” he says. “The values we have as unionists are why I’ve brought my kids.” They’ve started in Mumbai: In Pakistan: While in Melbourne, the crowd is so big it’s going to take a few more hours: If you’re waking up in Europe and the UK, then here is where you can find a protest near you: And here’s First Dog’s last cartoon for today: The organisers of the School Strike For Climate have estimated more than 300,000 people took to the streets across Australia today. More than double the number of Australians who rallied at climate strikes in March came out today, with an estimated 100,000 in Melbourne, 80,000 in Sydney, 30,000 in Brisbane, 20,000 in Hobart, 15,000 in Canberra, 10,000 in Perth and 10,000 in Adelaide, not to mention the other more than 100 events in non-capital cities and towns. Organisations striking included 33 Australian unions, 2,500 businesses including Atlassian, Canva, Domain and Intrepid, and faith institutions including the Anglican Church &amp; Uniting Church, they said. There are well over 100,000 people here in Melbourne and organisers are talking about 150,000. Niamh, 17, from Castlemaine told the crowd: “I fight for climate justice because everyone deserves a safe future. The government is not supporting it yet, but together we will change that.” Freya, 16, from Melbourne said: “The climate crisis is a human and global issue, and we need to act now.” The students spoke about recent natural disasters around the world, including massive wildfires in the Amazon and the early bushfires that have caused devastation in Queensland and NSW. “This is predicted to get a lot worse if we don’t act now,” Niamh said. The students then spoke about the demands of young people striking today, which include the complete phase-out of fossil fuels. The students have gone to great lengths to talk about the need to secure the futures of workers in fossil fuel-intensive industries, whose livelihoods will be affected as economies become carbon-neutral. Freya said: “We understand the role fossil fuels have played in putting food on the table for families. It’s vital we all work together, not against one another. It’s not about jobs v the environment.” Tens if not hundreds of thousands packed out Sydney’s Domain park in the CBD. Moemoana, 18, has come from Wollongong to the protest, and her homeland is Samoa. She’s here with members of the Matavai Pacific cultural centre. “I’ve come to fight for the Pacific. The Pacific Islands are [only] metres above sea level because of climate change and it’s a scary future for our islands. We want to urge people to take some action. “Seas are rising [in] Pacific Islands, especially Tuvalu and Kiribati, it’s a real threat, and Australia needs to know that Pacifika are neighbours and Australia really needs to help out. 17-year-old protest organiser Daisy spoke of the third demand of the campaign: funding a just transition and job creation for all fossil-fuel workers and communities. “We need solutions that care for people and our planet,” she said. “Climate justice is not about jobs versus the environment. Just as climate change hurts people, unemployment hurts people.” She said too many people were already suffering and would suffer if governments did not find solutions. “If our government cares about all of us then they need to get on with the job of stopping any new coal, oil and gas projects, powering Australia with 100% renewable energy by no later than 2030, and doing all this while funding just transition and jobs for all fossil fuel workers and their communities so that no one is left behind.” Marlie Thomas, a Kamilaroi teenager from Gunnedah, said she was attending the rally on the authority of her elders, not the Department of Education. “I’ve had to help collect bottled water for our family in Walgett,” she said. Former federal MP and City of Sydney councillor Kerryn Phelps told Guardian Australia cities “need to play their part when it comes planning for the future and mitigating climate change”. “That includes our own operations, working with businesses and residents, providing incentives to people to reduce their carbon footprint, to encourage active public transport, to encourage renewable sources of energy. “And because of the sheer size of the population, not only do they contribute so much to climate change risk but they also have the most, I think, to offer. Obviously we’ve got the agriculture sector, which needs to play its part, the transport sector, but individuals also can do so much themselves.” With the Australian strikes not even half over in many places, here’s what has happened so far: Hundreds of thousands have participated in the largest climate strike across Australia yet: more than 100 locations, from capital cities to regional centres such as Alice Springs, Byron Bay and Katherine. In Sydney and Melbourne crowds were estimated at 80,000 to 150,000 respectively, making them the biggest demonstrations since the Iraq war. In Tasmania 22,000 marchers made it the biggest strike action the state had ever seen. As part of Guardian Australia’s coverage, the federal energy minister, the opposition energy spokesman and two of the country’s biggest energy companies took questions from students. In Vanuatu, the deputy prime minister spoke directly to the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand as countries “to blame for this threat to our survival”. Protests in the Solomon Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and many more also continued throughout the day. They’re marching in the Philippines, too. Justin McCurry in Japan writes: Japan has suffered unseasonable, powerful and fatal storms in recent years that have also inflicted serious damage on its infrastructure. Last week’s typhoon was unusually strong, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power. The country has also been hit by record-breaking heatwaves – one last summer killed 65 people in a single week. Japan’s government had planned to expand nuclear power in an effort to tackle carbon dioxide emissions, but the Fukushima disaster changed all that. Pressure is building to invest more in renewables as the government expands coal-fired power stations and imports of gas and oil to fill the energy gap left by the post-Fukushima closure of dozens of nuclear reactors. Japan’s involvement in the climate strike has been low key. This Friday adults and children belonging to the Fridays for Future Tokyo movement will gather outside the United Nations University in central Tokyo at 5pm, make speeches and then march through the streets of the capital. Just over 100 people turned up in March; students at Japanese state schools were noticeably absent and I think that will be the case this Friday. A few protests have begun in Japan, and one is scheduled for Tokyo at 5pm local time. I cannot stress enough that my favourite thing from today is students on the ground interviewing their fellow strikers. Here is Oscar Lander-McBride, 10, interviewing Zac, 13. And from earlier, Esther Plummer, 13, interviewing Jasper, 15. There are more than 100,000 people in Melbourne, according to organisers. An aerial view of Melbourne, only 30 minutes in. And here’s the march crossing Brisbane’s Victoria bridge: In Bali: In Singapore: And in Brisbane who better to give a crowd estimate than Haemish Lander-McBride, 13, who has been to the past two strikes. “It’s massive in comparison to the other ones ... People aren’t just going to the first one – people are really coming again and again and again.” And big crowds in Adelaide: An estimated 10,000 in Perth: Mike Bowers in Canberra: It’s just past 2pm, which is the official start time in Melbourne. But as we saw in Sydney, crowds are so huge there are lines to get in. It’ll take a while to get into full swing. Early crowd numbers out of Sydney: 50,000 to 80,000 people at least. More from First Dog: Over on 2GB in Sydney and 4BC in Brisbane this morning Alan Jones was keeping a sceptical eye on the climate strike. “If you ask some of these people what it was about they wouldn’t have a clue,” Jones said without actually asking any of the strikers that question. An elderly caller suggested the children’s minds were being manipulated just like those of the Hitler Youth in Germany decades ago. Warming to the theme, Jones had a Goebbels quote on hand: “I will remind our listeners that his minister of propaganda ,Joseph Goebbels, also said it would not be impossible to prove with sufficient repetition and the psychological understanding of the people concerned that a square is in fact a circle. They are mere words and words can be moulded until they clothe ideas in disguise. This is what’s going on here isn’t it? Immensely disturbing I have to say. Immensely disturbing.” Former Queensland Greens senator Andrew Bartlett has this estimate: Similar thoughts in Sydney: The Brisbane rally keeps growing. People are still streaming in 30 minutes after the posted start time and police have had to shut roads on two sides of Queens Park. Hard to guess at a crowd figure, but comfortably over 10,000 at this point. This is not, of course, an anti-government rally, but there’s certainly no love for the coal embrace of the Queensland government. And notably, there are at least a half dozen left-wing unions here. The Electrical Trades Union has just taken a swipe, officials complaining the government has let the private sector do the heavy lifting on renewables, and giving a strong endorsement of climate action. Rebecca Ratcliffe in Delhi writes: Students protesters in India have a long list of demands for their political leaders. The air in many of its cities is infamously toxic, poor waste management is putting lives at risk and water shortages have reached crisis levels. Last year India was ranked among the bottom five countries on the environmental performance index produced by Yale and Columbia universities and the World Economic Forum. “We are in September now and we would be usually subjected to monsoon rains at this time but the rainfall is so erratic,” said Jacintha Thota, 14, who lives in Hyderabad. On Friday 200 students from her school and some of their teachers are expected to march together. Hyderabad is one of tens of locations, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru, where protests are expected to take place. The Fridays for Future movement is much smaller than other more established environmental campaigns in India, but students say it is growing in popularity, thanks partly to social media. In Delhi protesters are planning seven days of action, which includes marching to the ministry of urban affairs and housing on Friday. On Sunday protesters will meet at Bhalswa landfill, the second biggest dump yard in the city, while next week they will protest at other key political buildings. Bhavreen Kandhari, an environmental activist from Fridays For Future India will take part. “We have beautiful laws on the paper but none of it is being executed,” she said. Five years ago, when her daughters had an X-ray, she discovered the impact of Delhi’s pollution. “Their lungs were black in colour; they should be pink. For a child who is born and brought up in Delhi for 10 years this is the damage that they suffer,” she said. Her twin daughters, 15, will also be attending the march in Delhi. “The rich think ‘Oh I’ll put a mask on my child’, ‘I’ll get an air purifier’, and the poorest they can barely make two meals [a day].” Big turnout in Thailand – and a reminder that many of the protests in Asia will be kicking into gear soon as well. Wait no, maybe this one: Calling the winner now Meanwhile the Brisbane protest has broken its banks and people are streaming down the streets. There’s already a crowd at Treasury Gardens for the Melbourne school strike which kicks off at 2pm. Thea Hamilton, 16, is one of the organisers. “I’m really excited and hopefully we’ll be able to get some really good action out of this and get more people involved in climate action and climate justice,” she says. She says young people “are looking for a space to be heard and to really feel represented by this global movement so we can call for climate action at the UN global climate summit on the 23rd”. Continuing our series. EnergyAustralia has agreed to take a question from a climate striker. Along with Queensland’s Stanwell Corporation, it is the other one of Australia’s top 10 carbon emitters to agree to take a question. Josh O’Callaghan, 15, from Adelaide asks: What are the future initiatives that your company plans to put in place to have 100% renewable energy production? Mark Collette, the head of EnergyAustralia’s customer business: Thanks Josh. Designing and building a 100% renewable energy system is a huge challenge for Australia. I think Australians are up for the challenge. Your home state of South Australia has solar and wind already providing over half of the electricity supplied to South Australians. In planning for 100% renewables, the first 50% is easier than the second 50%. Solar and wind generation follow the sun and the wind, so when it is not sunny and windy we can’t produce power for customers. I reckon that above about 50% renewables for Australia we need to find ways to move the power from the sun and the wind to dark and still times, or use it immediately. One way we do this is storage. Already we have two of the largest batteries in the country in Victoria, and we are working on two large pumped hydro projects – one of which is in your state of South Australia. Another way we are exploring is helping customers use power when it is available from the sun and the wind. We can time pool pumps and hot water systems to run just through these times. There’s a long way to go but we like tackling tough problems, like the second 50%.” In Sydney Daisy, 17, tells the crowd their frustration has never been about people working in the fossil-fuel industry. Their demand is “about acting to halt this crisis while creating safe and meaningful work for all of us”. And let’s not forget the regions. More photos from Lismore from Frewoini Baume: And these beautiful pictures from Katherine in the NT: And here’s Albury: The crowd in Sydney is getting so big you can really only see it from the air. Perth and Canberra aren’t too shabby either: This is the third nationwide climate strike in Australia – after November 2018 and March 2019. They get bigger every time. Amelia Neylon, 16, is on the ground and tells Guardian Australia: The crowd is reportedly over 22,000. Bob Brown at this count has said it is larger then the Franklin River rally. Making this the largest rally in Tasmania held to date. It’s all happening. Another must-watch, exclusive to Guardian Australia: Meanwhile Australia’s strikes are making waves around the world: If you are Gen X or above, then you can laugh at the latest from First Dog on the Moon instead*: *This is a joke – First Dog is funny for all ages. I’m a millennial / Gen Z so I understand these signs. If you don’t, rest assured they are very funny. In Brisbane, here’s Parker with his message to the government – and a great poem. The award for best sign is getting more competitive every minute. Here is Matilda (3). Sydney’s strikes have started but aren’t even at full swing, Melbourne’s starts in 1.5 hours, and preparations have begun in Perth. Earlier today we saw huge turnouts in regional areas, including Alice Springs and Byron Bay. Angus Taylor has also agreed to take a question. From Josh O’Callaghan, 15, from Adelaide: It is said that ‘if those who believe in climate change are wrong, we will have needlessly created a cleaner world, but if those who don’t believe in climate change are wrong, we will die’. Do you agree? If so, how should we act on this? Angus Taylor : The federal government is taking strong action to reduce global emissions and respond to the serious challenge of climate change. The government’s $3.5bn climate solutions package sets out how we will meet our 2030 Paris target, down to the last tonne. People are free to have their views, but my personal opinion is that students should be at school during school hours.” Reporter Helen Davidson is on the ground in Sydney: Our first dispatches from Amelia Neylon in Hobart: Meanwhile crowds build in Sydney. There is a LONG line to get in. Esther in Byron Bay has interviewed her fellow strikers. Must-watch. First images in from Hobart: Sydney’s strike is scheduled to start at noon. Huge crowds are still making their way to the city. This could take some time and is looking immense. Some footage from Thailand: Continuing our Q&amp;A series is Labor’s spokesman on climate change and energy, Mark Butler. Frewoini Baume, 18, from Lismore asks: Permanent destruction for temporary economic gain is not a sustainable or stable economy. Why are you supporting the coal industry when it has been scientifically proven to be unsustainable? Yes, the economy may temporarily suffer but the longer you wait the more severe the impact. So why not act now? Mark Butler: The Labor party remains deeply committed to taking climate action to make sure that we comply with the commitments to future generations in the Paris agreement – to keep global warming way below 2 degrees and to pursue efforts around 1.5 degrees to make sure that we are at net zero emissions by the middle of the century. There is no denying that Australia needs to drastically reduce its carbon emissions, but after coming down by more than 10% when Labor was last in office, emissions have been rising ever since the election of Tony Abbott, and the government’s own data shows they will keep rising all the way to 2030. Australia doesn’t have a national climate policy. That is why we need to keep pressuring the Liberal government to take serious climate action.” Some more charts, this time Australia-specific from our data editor, Nick Evershed: This first shows warming in Australia, measuring how different the temperature is in a given year against the long-term average. Put simply, it demonstrates how things are getting hotter, and 2018 was the third-hottest year: This second shows Australia’s quarterly emissions over time. The bars need to be under the two lines (assuming a linear rate of reduction to meet the target) if we are going to meet various emissions targets. The pink line shows the trajectory to a 28% reduction in emissions, based on 2005 levels, by 2030. This is the more ambitious of Australia’s possible reduction targets under the Paris agreement. The purple line is the trajectory proposed by the Climate Change Authority based on the best available science to ensure Australia makes a meaningful contribution towards keeping global temperature increases under 2C. Ideally the bars should be below both lines. And some early data from Twitter: #ClimateStrike is trending #1 in Australia and has been for the past two hours #schoolstrike4climate is at #2 and #friday4future is at #5 Australian cities where #climatestrike is trending: Adelaide #2 Darwin #1 Melbourne #1 Perth #1 Sydney #1 An on-the-ground sketch from First Dog on the Moon You may have noticed the arresting temperature chart at the top of our site this morning – I know I did. Our colleagues internationally have also compiled more charts that explain the climate crisis. And some slightly better news: In Lismore Frewoini Baume has interviewed Suhani Sheppeard, 16. FB: “Why are you striking?” SS: “I’m striking because I believe it takes one person to change the world. Having that opportunity to be that person is incredibly inspiring and I want to be the one voice to inspire others. “It feels incredibly empowering to be a part of the community in our global strike, and inspires me to always fight for climate justice.” Jotham Napat, Vanuatu’s deputy prime minister, delivered his speech in English “because the people who need to hear this, the ones who are causing the problems, are not here”. According to the Vanuatu Posts’ Dan McGarry, Napat named the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand as the ones who are “to blame for this threat to our survival”. Earlier Vanuatu’s foreign affairs minister, Ralph Regenvanu, also spoke and criticised Australia. He characterised the discussions at the recent Pacific Islands forum in Tuvalu as a “fight” between Australia and the rest of the Pacific. Regenvanu, an outspoken Pacific leader, has also promised to take his country’s climate grievance to the International Court of Justice to seek legal redress. During the Pacific Islands forum Regenvanu told the Guardian that critical talks almost collapsed twice amid “fierce” clashes between Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and other Pacific leaders. “Australia is out there – they’re not with us,” Regenvanu said at the time. Today students in Vanuatu partnered with the Vanuatu climate action network to stage a silent strike. Students wearing traditional dress and holding banners with messages about the climate crisis stood around the capital, Port Vila, as politicians walked around the city viewing the messages, finishing up at the seafront of the city where there were art exhibitions, poetry performances and speeches. In Albury the march will head to the office of the environment minister, Sussan Ley. Our first Q&amp;A is in. The Stanwell Corporation is one of Australia’s biggest energy companies. EnergyAustralia and Stanwell were the only members of Australia’s top 10 carbon emitters who agreed to take a question for our live blog today. Narii Hamill-Salmon, 15, from the Gold Coast asks: The Stanwell Corporation was named as the nation’s third largest carbon emitter in 2017-18 [by the Clean Energy Regulator] thus making the company a significant contributor to the climate crisis. Mr Van Breda, if you could say one thing to the future generations of this planet, the ones who are going to experience the most devastating impacts of climate change, what would you tell them?” Richard Van Breda, chief executive: Thanks for your question, Narii. I think a lot about that, and here’s what I would tell future generations about the work we do at Stanwell. The electricity industry is at a tricky time in its transition to lower carbon technologies. The proportion of low carbon energy and storage in Australia is increasing quickly, but those technologies are not yet at a point where they can function without support from fossil fuel generation. As a company that operates coal-fired power stations, it’s Stanwell’s job to provide the electricity that people need, as the industry moves to a lower carbon future. That change can’t happen immediately and needs to be planned and done carefully. We ramp generation from our coal-fired power stations up and down every day to support solar generation in the middle of the day, and still provide the electricity people need in the evenings. We are also exploring new generation and storage technology that will help reduce emissions. I’m really proud of the work Stanwell people are doing in all those areas.” And Frewoini Baume, 18, has sent through the first few images of the Lismore strikes. If people want a last minute sign for the climate strike First Dog on the Moon says you can print this out on vegan paper and wave it about. More dispatches from Esther in Byron: There are big contingents and great photos coming in from all across the Pacific – especially Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands right now. And in Castlemaine, Victoria, where this all began (in Australia at least), there are no signs of slowing. Early signs from University of Sydney: And nearby, stores all along King Street have closed for the day in solidarity. In Gloucester New South Wales we have an early contender for best costume today (the sunflower). In a landmark decision earlier this year, a court blocked a new coalmine in the region because of the “dire consequences” of increasing emissions. Absolutely huge turnout in Geelong where they’re singing and chanting. And more from Townsville: It’s not even 11am yet on the east coast and it’s already obvious today’s protests are going to be bigger than ever before. First Barnesy now The Oils: In Vanuatu: The Knitting Nannas are already down in Lismore. Our first student on the ground Esther Plummer (13) has sent pictures from Byron Bay. Earlier we said 1,000 businesses are supporting the strike. That number is now 2,600, with the latest figures from Not Business As Usual. And here is music legend (and all-round legend) Jimmy Barnes, with his message of support to the strikers. In New Caledonia: Big turnout in Townsville. The event there started at 9am and they will be marching at 10am. Protesters are staging a die-in in the centre of Alice Springs. Traditional owners have stressed the importance of putting Indigenous perspectives at the centre of these protests. Yesterday Sammy Wilson, a custodian of Uluru and chair of the Central Land Council, announced that the council will join the strike across the Northern Territory. “Aboriginal people want to be part of the solution,” he said. “We want to have access to clean technologies such as solar power so that our children have the chance to keep living on our traditional country. “I support their right to take this action [and] I call on them to spare a thought for Aboriginal people out bush who may not be able to travel to the strikes but who are already suffering most during our hotter, longer and drier summers.” After the NT’s hottest summer on record, delegates at the council meeting last month said climate change and water security were their top policy priorities. Kate Lamb in Jakarta writes: In Indonesia the climate strikes come as the country faces an escalating environmental emergency – tens of thousands of hectares of rainforest are burning in Sumatra and Kalimantan, home to some of the largest swathes of virgin forest in the world. This year the annual fires – a result of “slash and burn” practices to clear land mostly for palm oil plantations – have been exacerbated by the El Nino phenomenon and severe droughts. Thick haze has blanketed cities in Indonesia and neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia, and also forced schools to be closed and increased the risk of respiratory-related illnesses. Also on the minds of young Indonesian activists is how to curb the country’s plastic addiction. Home to more than 250 million people, Indonesia is the second largest contributor to ocean plastics after China. But in recent years environmental awareness around plastics has gained momentum, largely driven by inspiring Indonesian students, artists, musicians and activists. On Friday hundreds are expected to take to the streets of Jakarta and 12 cities across the archipelago, on the islands of Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan and Bali. Expect colourful costumes, live performances from local indie bands, and talk of an “energy revolution”. From here in the steamy tropics, the focus of that discussion will be on the future of solar energy. More from the Pacific from Kate Lyons Climate strike events kicked off in Tonga yesterday (which held its main event – a community clean-up on Thursday because of the significant number of Seventh Day Adventists in the country who observe the Sabbath on Fridays). Pacific countries, many of which are bearing the brunt of the effects of the climate crisis, are holding events today, though most are not holding strikes or traditional protests, instead focusing on community events such as clean-ups, barbecues and poetry performances. Things are already well under way in Alice Springs. Up to 60 local businesses have also shut their doors for today. Meanwhile preparations continue around the country. Eleanor Ainge Roy writes from Dunedin New Zealand is pushing back its participation in the strikes to Friday 27 September so high school students can sit national exams this week. Large strikes are planned nationwide. Sea level rise is a real and increasingly urgent threat to New Zealand. Most of New Zealand’s nearly 5 million people live on the coast. Sea walls to protect vulnerable communities are being constructed – from the former gold-mining town of Hokitika on the west coast to vulnerable beachside huts in the isolated far north. Sea level rise is also a pressing issue for the country’s Indigenous people, with their tribal marae [meeting houses] mostly on low-lying coastal land. Jacinda Ardern’s Labour coalition government has vowed to tackle climate change head on, committing to making the country carbon neutral by 2050 and planting 1bn trees. The first climate strike in New Zealand was interrupted by the Christchurch mosque attacks, with children in central Christchurch shepherded into lockdown for hours. It was initially thought, incorrectly, that the striking children may have been a target. Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand’s policy manager, Annaliese Johnston, says New Zealand youth climate groups have been instrumental in increasing awareness in the Pacific region. “The youth of today in New Zealand ... have woken us all up to the urgent call to action to protect our common home and future.” Greta Thunberg, the 16-year old Swedish student who inspired this movement, has recorded a short film for today’s strike. In it, she and Guardian columnist George Monbiot talk about the importance of natural solutions – low-cost, effective initiatives such as rowing trees. And for a bit of a blast from the past you can read Thunberg’s opinion piece from November 2018 – written specifically for Australia – when we became one of the first countries to hold nationwide student strikes. “In the Pacific we don’t go on strike, but we do other things,” says Patricia Mallam, a Fijian climate activist from 350.org. Over the course of the day children and students from Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Tonga, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea will take part in poetry performances, silent protests, sporting events, barbecues and intergenerational discussions about the effects of climate change in the region. These events rather than traditional protests and street marches make more sense for the Pacific, says Mallam, because it is such a community-driven region “and we all know that the problem is not within the community”. “For instance, you don’t have any coalmines in the Pacific, so we can’t have people striking outside coalmines. The problems are not being caused here. But in countries where there are coalmines or banks financing the fossil-fuel industry, it makes sense for people to go on strike, so they’re voicing their distaste for what’s going on to keep their economies afloat,” she says over the phone from Fiji. “We all know that the problem is not being caused here in the Pacific, but we’re facing the full brunt of the climate crisis.” The Pacific is estimated to contribute just 0.03% of global emissions despite making up 0.12% of the world’s population, but is at the frontline of the climate emergency, with countries facing rising sea levels, coastal erosion, the destruction of crucial reefs, inundations and warming seas that lead to more frequent and more severe cyclones. “It is a day, especially for the polluters, they need to quickly understand what’s going on,” says Mallam. “But at the same time, in the Pacific we feel that because we’re at the frontline of the impacts, it’s important for us to speak up and have other nations hear what’s happening.” Preparations are under way in the Solomon Islands already. And Kate Lyons spoke to some of the activists across the Pacific ahead of today’s big day. Here’s everything you need to know about today’s strikes as collated by my colleague Lisa Cox. There are more than 100 locations, and the strikes have support from 30 unions, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and more than 1,000 businesses including Atlassian, Future Super and KeepCup. And in news from this morning, more than 250 academics have also signed on in support. Morning everyone. Today the global climate strikes start in Australia and the Pacific. The Guardian Australia team will follow it all. We have a huge day of coverage planned. The Australian strikes will be in full swing from 11am or noon (local time) and before that in New Zealand and the Pacific. Our correspondents are standing by, and cartoonist First Dog on the Moon is on duty – they’ll be sketching throughout the day. And because today is really about the students, we’ve organised to receive on-the-ground updates from participants. Here they are in a (non-exhaustive) list: Narii-Hamill Salmon, 15, Gold Coast Qld Frewoini Baume, 18, Lismore NSW Josh O’Callaghan, 15, Adelaide SA Amelia Neylon, 16, Hobart Tas Esther Plummer, 13, Byron Bay NSW Iestyn (13) and Owynn (11) Harries, Brisbane Qld Dakota Barret-Perry, 15, Melbourne Vic They have also been given the opportunity to ask a question directly of federal politicians and prominent business leaders – from the energy minister to EnergyAustralia. We’ll publish the questions and their answers throughout the day. Stay with us. For the next 24 hours, the Guardian will be reporting in real time on the wave of climate strikes as they ripple around the world, starting in the Asia-Pacific region and continuing through Europe and Africa before culminating in the Americas. Millions of young people are expected to turn out in more than 3,000 events worldwide in this latest edition of the Fridays For Future strikes. On this occasion, adults have been invited to join in and companies, organisations, trade unions, even churches are expected to join the fray.

The rain is an incessant barrage of watery bullets firing down through the tree canopy. Thunder crashes. Tangles of vines and spider webs make for a Hollywood movie scene of truly impenetrable jungle. Near the front of the seven hikers is a Welshman carrying a billhook, a backpack almost the same size as him, and what appears to all intents and purposes to be a briefcase. The slope is so steep that the heavy briefcase clatters against the ground at every step, so he swings it in front of him – clonk – like a ship using an anchor to warp out of harbour against the green, vertical tide. He takes two steps up and swings the case up the hill again. Clonk. On this wet March day in Mozambique, Professor Julian Bayliss, naturalist, explorer, fellow of the Royal Geographical and Royal Entomological societies, is heading deep into the green heart of the Mabu forest for the first time. The forest, also known as the “Google forest” after the way he “discovered” it using Google Earth in 2005, has more recently been called “the butterfly forest”, after the butterflies that congregate around the summit of Mount Mabu at certain times of year. Many of the species since identified here carry Bayliss’s name. These include Nadzikambia baylissi, the sleek little chameleon with the prehensile tail, and Cymothoe baylissi, the graceful forest gliding butterfly, both of which exist only here within the largest rainforest in southern Africa. “One other thing we have discovered on this trip,” shouts Bayliss, with a huge grin over the sound of yet another downpour on another day on another seemingly unending hillside ascent, “Mabu is not flat.” The scientific discovery of Mount Mabu was a huge breakthrough. Working with Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, the Mozambique government’s institute for agricultural research (IIAM) and the Darwin Initiative, Bayliss was sitting at his laptop looking at Google Earth in 2005, when he wondered whether mountains in Mozambique might also harbour some of the species he was uncovering in nearby Malawi. So he and a Malawian botanist named Hassam Patel decided to take a look. As reported by the Observer, over the years Bayliss and the Kew Gardens team have since identified three new species of snake, eight species of butterfly, a bat, a crab, two chameleons and many plants, as well as a trove of rare birds that are critically endangered. However, no one has ever journeyed into the heart of the forest until now. Previous discoveries came from the forest base camp, the peak and a small satellite camp, all on the lower eastern edge. To explore Mabu’s secrets further, an expedition has been undertaken this month by the international scientific and environmental reporting initiative Alliance Earth. The Alliance Earth team’s objectives were to create a 3D map, uncover new species, check on the health of the forest, publish an ethno-botanical study, seek out potential non-timber forest products, produce a feature documentary and film a 360-degree virtual reality experience for museums and science centres around the world, so everyone can explore the mountain’s mysteries. “This is a new species of Dipsadoboa,” Bayliss says, holding the poisonous tree snake with a twinge of obvious concern. As it writhes, he holds it farther away from his torso. “This is currently undescribed, it doesn’t have a name yet.” Stretching out imploringly, the snake tries to reach the perceived safety of my video camera. “To find an actual new species of snake is extremely exciting, and very rare.” He has now found three new snakes in Mabu’s forest. According to Bayliss, on this trip the team have identified at least one new butterfly species, and quite possibly more, once genetic testing confirms them. They have also found a Caecilian, one of the rarest animals on Earth, which is sort of a cross between a reptile and amphibian, and may be a new type of its kind. But these precious finds aren’t the only new discoveries that have him excited. Under a huge tree he airs his wet boots, squeezing his socks dry before putting them on again. “Yesterday was great. We discovered a new waterfall, which is fantastic. We’ve never been here before, and because it’s the rainy season the water was just crashing through the rocks.” More discoveries have come daily, such as the “valley of giants”, an open canyon with a central raised ridge surrounded by the largest grouping of big trees yet found. Their vast trunks stretch upwards like a cathedral, blending into the green nave of leaves hundreds of metres above. These waterfalls, huge trees, deep canyons, and riverside camping spots are important geographical discoveries that Bayliss hopes will help bring tourists here. At times the forest guides are clearly as perplexed about directions as the team, looping round in ever-widening circles in search of a way across the maze of folded valleys, often climbing up and down one punishing ridge after another in order to make headway. Senior hunter turned guide Ofélio Cavalião, 41, and his son Bartolomeo, 26, joined the expedition one morning before breakfast, hiking from their home many kilometres away. They heard through the grapevine that Bayliss had returned and so tracked him down. Cavalião and Bayliss have worked together on every visit he has made to Mabu’s forest. The local hunter and famous scientist have developed a friendship and deep respect for one another. Once Cavalião arrived, the team started to push deeper into the most unexplored parts of the eastern forest, following the tops of the ridges and making better time. Guides such as Cavalião have an intimate knowledge of the area, making the outside “discovery” of Mabu a purely scientific designation. According to him, the local people have benefited from the forest for generations. It even saved their lives during the back-to-back conflicts that started in 1964 with the war of independence against Portugal, before segueing into the civil war that finally ended in 1992. His friend, 38-year-old guide Ernesto André, agrees. He grew up in the forest, sheltered from the ravages of war, with dozens of other people in small forest camps. Not far into the undergrowth, holes the size of unfilled graves are clearly man-made. Standing in one, André explains that these sheltered whole families and were the only way to hide the sounds of crying children from the Portuguese soldiers who tried to hunt them down. On a remote ridge line with another potential new butterfly in his net, Bayliss talks about the future of the mountain. “Every new discovery helps make the case for the mountain to be officially protected,” he says. But time is of the essence. The team finds the forest intact, yet still not officially protected. A recent report in the Guardian told how, despite a two-year ban on timber exports, corruption and organised crime are still stripping Mozambique of forests such as this. According to the independent Environmental Investigation Agency, as much as $130m worth of hardwoods are stolen from Mozambique annually. Much of it is sent to China. Ecologically aware visitors could help build a tourism industry here that protects the forest and benefits the community in a sustainable way, while safeguarding the incredible biodiversity, according to Justiça Ambiental, the Mozambican environmental justice group that has been working at Mabu since 2009 to create and implement an eco-tourism plan for the mountain. The group’s forestry specialist, Rene Machoco, explains that its vision is for Mabu to be legally designated as a community conservation area. André says that before Justiça Ambiental came, his community didn’t think the forest was particularly valuable, “but then it was explained and we knew the truth. The forest is life and the forest is wealth”. Tourism is only one way to help people like Ernesto benefit from their home. Expedition team member Ana Alecia Lyman is a non-timber forest products specialist based in Mozambique who runs Bio Óleos de Miombo. “Non-timber forest products, such as honey or mushrooms, can be sustainably derived from the landscape to generate income in rural communities without jeopardising local biodiversity,” she says. After seeing the forest first-hand, she is enthusiastic and feels that the more people who are engaged in these sustainable value chains, the more local investment there can be in the health of the forest. Under the tree canopy, Bayliss is hunting an elusive butterfly that finally flutters and rests on the leafy forest floor in a scattered beam of sunlight. Butterflies use solar energy to fly. Their wing veins are usually dark in order to channel energy from the sun to engage their muscles. This is why when they are seen slowly folding their wings while perched in the sunlight, they are getting ready to take to the air. But the shy brown butterfly with the spotted wing markings is no match for the speedy scientist from Wales. A deft swing loops the net shut, “I think I got it!” “This is probably a new species,” he says, looking through the net and walking over to a sunny spot. Extracting it gently he examines the wing spots. “This is probably the one we have been looking for.” He looks closer. With a breathless voice he breaks with his usual understatement. “This is very exciting – this is the first time I have ever seen this butterfly.” What else awaits discovery in the remote forest of Mabu’s basin? Potential answers to that question sit snugly in Bayliss’s anchor-like briefcase: motion-sensitive video cameras, the first ever to be deployed at Mabu. Encased in steel boxes and strapped to trees, the four high-definition cameras will be left running at secret locations deep in the foliage for two years. Having finished securing the last camera above a stream, Bayliss washes his hands in the clear water among the mossy rocks, looking satisfied. “Every time we come to Mabu we discover something new. Who knows what we will find next?” The question hangs in the air as he turns around and starts back on the long hike to base camp with his butterfly net in hand, his briefcase empty, and his wet boots squishing merrily. Alliance Earth paid for Jeffrey Barbee’s transport and accommodation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jun/09/record-boost-in-new-solar-power-continues-massive-industry-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-09T16:11:00Z","webTitle":"Record boost in new solar power continues massive industry growth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/09/record-boost-in-new-solar-power-continues-massive-industry-growth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jun/09/record-boost-in-new-solar-power-continues-massive-industry-growth","fields":{"headline":"Record boost in new solar power continues massive industry growth","bodyText":"A record amount of solar power was added to the world’s grids in 2014, pushing total cumulative capacityto 100 times the level it was in 2000. Around 40GW of solar power was installed last year, meaning there is now a total of 178GW to meet world electricity demand, prompting renewable energy associations to claim that a tipping point has been reached that will allow rapid acceleration of the technology. “For the first time ever in Europe, renewables produced more power than nuclear – and solar power was key in achieving this remarkable achievement,” said Michael Schmela, executive adviser to trade body SolarPower Europe, which compiled the statistics published on Tuesday. Britain led the European solar expansion, with government incentives helping to add 2.4GW of solar resources to the domestic market, and a third to Europe’s overall 7GW of growth. Unofficial sources estimated the British numbers even higher – at up to 3GW – based on an analysis of solar module shipments. “The success of the UK, set to be the largest European market again in 2015, reinforces the evidence that solar power is a versatile and cost-efficient energy source in any climate,” said James Watson, the CEO of SolarPower Europe, formerly known as the European Photovoltaic Industry Association. SolarPower Europe argues that to nudge Europe away from fossil fuels, better market access will be crucial for solar in a new EU energy market design proposal expected next year. Although global growth was impressive, the European pace of development last year slowed to its lowest since 2009, as incentives known as feed-in tariffs were removed across Europe in 2014. Even Germany, the continent’s largest solar market, saw a slight decline in annual installed capacity to 1.9GW, as incentives were cut and market uncertainties increased. There are fears in Brussels of another solar trade spat with China in the offing, with tough import duties slapped on three Chinese firms last week for violating minimum pricing agreements. Some German solar panel manufacturers have suffered from state-subsidised Chinese competition. Industry sources though say that the removal of minimum pricing agreements would lower costs in Europe and boost growth across the sector. China (10.6GW), Japan (9.7GW) and the US (6.5GW) were the three biggest global solar markets last year, with feed-in tariffs, self-consumption measures, tax breaks and net-metering policies all nourishing growth. One unexpected byproduct of the boom has been that the scale of solar panel distribution between utilities and consumer rooftops has started to balance out. In Europe, the report found that around 40% of solar energy in Europe now comes from utilities, while the amount generated by rooftops has fallen to 60%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/sep/30/businesses-ignore-un-sustainable-development-goals-survey","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-30T11:54:33Z","webTitle":"More than half of all businesses ignore UN's sustainable development goals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/30/businesses-ignore-un-sustainable-development-goals-survey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/30/businesses-ignore-un-sustainable-development-goals-survey","fields":{"headline":"More than half of all businesses ignore UN's sustainable development goals","bodyText":"Businesses are failing to work on the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs), according to two new surveys, despite being billed as having a key role to play in achieving the ambitious goals. With an estimated investment gap of at least $3tn annually across the SDGs for the next 15 years, private sector involvement is critical if countries are to succeed. Yet fewer than half of global companies plan to engage with the goals, according to Ethical Corporation’s State of Responsible Business 2016 report, which surveyed 2,045 sustainability professionals globally (36% of whom worked for a company or a brand). Meanwhile, a study from sustainability consultancy Corporate Citizenship found the lack of tangible business action on the SDGs is causing a trust problem among consumers, particularly so-called millennials. Findings showed that despite 81% of millennials believing business has a key role to play in achieving the SDGs, the majority of businesses are not yet acting. This is not surprising, says Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, chairman of the Business and Sustainable Development Commission (a not-for-profit organisation focusing on sustainable business), and former deputy UN secretary-general. “[Sustainable business] is a movement that’s still gathering momentum and authority,” he says. “There’s also a realm of difference [between] those who are trying to make sustainability part of their core business strategy and those who still see it as an ‘add-on’.” US engagement low Regionally, respondents in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East are engaging most with the goals, according to Ethical Corporation’s research, with the lowest level of engagement (37%) in North America. US-headquartered businesses are sometimes slower than their counterparts in Europe to embrace UN-sponsored initiatives, says Aron Cramer, CEO of sustainability consultancy BSR, adding they “have a cultural preference to do first and talk later”. “That said, we see a great many [US] companies, such as Microsoft and others, embracing the goals and working towards integrating them into their business strategies.” Developed regions are focusing primarily on climate action (SDG 13), the report finds, while developing regions are prioritising pressing development challenges. SDG four, quality education, came out top in Africa, for example. Climate action was also the most supported goal among corporate and brand respondents (63%), followed by SDG eight, decent work and economic growth (52%), and SDG 12, responsible consumption and production (51%), which was particularly popular among apparel, fast-moving consumer goods and manufacturing companies. SDG one, no poverty, and SDG two, no hunger, were among the least supported goals, scoring 22% and 20% respectively. Integrating the SDGs into business Although it’s too early for practical, widespread business action on the SDGs, companies are doing the groundwork to integrate the goals into their sustainability strategies, according to Malloch-Brown. Building on a sound, established approach to human rights and environmental issues is vital, says Ole Lund Hansen, chief of leadership programmes at the UN Global Compact, before companies determine where their activities have an impact on people, economies or the environment, and prioritise specific goals. From there, businesses need to consider which SDGs reflect their own purpose, review existing sustainable development work in the bigger picture context of the goals, and identify where they stand to make the most difference, says Cramer. Hansen says companies should incentivise every employee to achieve SDG-related targets, including through performance reviews. A report by risk management firm DNV GL highlights 17 companies (including Unilever, Siemens, Marks &amp; Spencer and Danone) taking action on specific SDGs, and concludes that businesses of this kind are ready to take “extraordinary action” to help achieve the goals. The report says these firms are characterised by their ability to see the potential of combining growth and sustainability, form collaborations, use technology to achieve scale and reach, and see the SDGs as a way to achieve competitive advantage. The business it highlights for SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), Kenyan telecommunications giant Safaricom, created the mobile money platform M-Pesa, which is now used by more than 25m people in Africa, Asia and Europe. It allows people who struggle to access traditional financial services to send and receive money via their mobile phones, and has provided a springboard for further innovations in renewable energy, healthcare, food and agriculture. For example, off-grid solar company M-Kopa Solar is now providing solar energy to 400,000 customers in east Africa, who pay for the service using M-Pesa. The carrot and the stick Above all, the SDGs must become central to core business goals and investment decisions, according to Unilever CEO Paul Polman, who believes that the SDGs offer the “greatest economic opportunity of a lifetime”. He says Unilever’s “sustainable living” brands (which it defines as those that have integrated sustainability into their purpose and products) are growing 30% faster than the rest of the company. Businesses can expect more laws incentives and deterrents on development-critical issues, says Malcolm Preston, global sustainability leader at PwC. Catalysing further progress on the goals will require a more balanced approach to regulations on investment, particularly renewable energy investments v fossil fuel subsidies, says Malloch-Brown. Policy-makers could also consider making corporate contributions to sustainable development mandatory, says Ashoka’s Archana Sinha. India, for example, has obliged major organisations to donate at least 2% of their net annual profit to charity. “Governments need to put their noses under the hood and understand the type of regulatory environment businesses require,” Malloch-Brown concludes. “If you’re going to let them in [to the field of development] because you need the finance, you can only let them through if they’re not going to be rapacious market-makers, if they’re going to invest in long-term business models.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/26/morocco-poised-to-become-a-solar-superpower-with-launch-of-desert-mega-project","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-26T07:58:54Z","webTitle":"Morocco poised to become a solar superpower with launch of desert mega-project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/26/morocco-poised-to-become-a-solar-superpower-with-launch-of-desert-mega-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/26/morocco-poised-to-become-a-solar-superpower-with-launch-of-desert-mega-project","fields":{"headline":"Morocco poised to become a solar superpower with launch of desert mega-project","bodyText":"The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is used to big productions. On the edge of the Sahara desert and the centre of the north African country’s “Ouallywood” film industry it has played host to big-budget location shots in Lawrence of Arabia, The Mummy, The Living Daylights and even Game of Thrones. Now the trading city, nicknamed the “door of the desert”, is the centre for another blockbuster – a complex of four linked solar mega-plants that, alongside hydro and wind, will help provide nearly half of Morocco’s electricity from renewables by 2020 with, it is hoped, some spare to export to Europe. The project is a key plank in Morocco’s ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower. When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power (CSP) plant in the world, and the first phase, called Noor 1, will go live next month. The mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs the world over, but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down. The potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades. In the days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 the German particle physicist Gerhard Knies, calculated that the world’s deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide for humanity’s power needs for a whole year. The challenge though, has been capturing that energy and transporting it to the population centres where it is required. As engineers put the finishing touches to Noor 1, its 500,000 crescent-shaped solar mirrors glitter across the desert skyline. The 800 rows follow the sun as it tracks across the heavens, whirring quietly every few minutes as their shadows slip further east. When they are finished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as Morocco’s capital city, Rabat, and generate 580MW of electricity, enough to power a million homes. Noor 1 itself has a generating capacity of 160MW. Morocco’s environment minister, Hakima el-Haite, believes that solar energy could have the same impact on the region this century that oil production had in the last. But the $9bn (£6bn) project to make her country’s deserts boom was triggered by more immediate concerns, she said. “We are not an oil producer. We import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from abroad and that has big consequences for our state budget,” el-Haite told the Guardian. “We also used to subsidise fossil fuels which have a heavy cost, so when we heard about the potential of solar energy, we thought; why not?” Solar energy will make up a third of Morocco’s renewable energy supply by 2020, with wind and hydro taking the same share each. “We are very proud of this project,” el-Haite said. “I think it is the most important solar plant in the world.” Each parabolic mirror is 12 metres high and focussed on a steel pipeline carrying a ‘heat transfer solution’ (HTF) that is warmed to 393C as it snakes along the trough before coiling into a heat engine. There, it is mixed with water to create steam that turns energy-generating turbines. The HTF is made up of a synthetic thermal oil solution that is pumped towards a heat tank containing molten salts that can store heat energy for three hours, allowing the plant to power homes into the night. The mirrors are spaced in tier formations, to minimise damage from sand blown up by desert winds. Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017 will store energy for up to eight hours – opening the prospect of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara, and the surrounding region. “The biggest challenge we faced was being able to finish the project on time with the performance [level] we needed to achieve,” said Rashid al-Bayad, the project director. But even as the first phase of the project nears completion, Morocco is eyeing grander international ambitions. “We are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania as a first step,” says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of Société d’Investissements Energétiques, the national renewable energy investment firm. But he says the project’s ultimate impact will go far wider – even as far as the Middle East. “The [ultimate] objective given by his majesty the king is Mecca.” Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilising effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen). Talks are ongoing with Tunisia, and energy exports northwards across the Mediterranean remain a key goal, despite the collapse in 2013 of the Desertec project, a German plan to source 15% of Europe’s energy from North African desert solar by 2050. “We believe that it’s possible to export energy to Europe but first we would have to build the interconnectors which don’t yet exist,” said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman. “Specifically, we would have to build interconnections, which would not go through the existing one in Spain, and then start exporting.” Spain has itself prohibited new solar projects because of a lack of interconnectors to transmit the energy to France. The EU has set a target of ensuring that 10% of each member country’s power can be transported abroad by cable by 2020. In the meantime, Morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs for resource independence. This could one day include water desalination, in a country that is increasingly being hit by drought as the climate warms. Officials are keenly aware of the running they are making in what is the most advanced renewable energy programme in the Middle East and North African region. “We are at the avante-garde of solar,” el-Kadiri says. About $9bn has been invested in the Noor complex, much of it from international institutions such as the European Investment Bank and World Bank and backed by Moroccan government guarantees. Undisclosed energy subsidies from Morocco’s unelected ruler, King Mohammed VI, have prevented the cost from being transferred to energy consumers. One month before launch, over a thousand mostly Moroccan workers are still racing to fix electric wires, take down scaffolding and wrap rockwool insulation around steel pipelines. They bustle past in yellow and orange bibs, working 12-hour shifts against a backdrop of the Atlas mountains. Harnesses with hammers and gloves strapped to their belts swing by their sides. Ubiquitous hard hats, safety shoes and ear plugs give the scene an air of theatrical camp. For Hajar Lakhael, a 25-year-old environment and security manager from Meknes, rehearsals are almost over and the blockbuster production is nearly ready for action. “We’ve done the construction and now we will see how these projects look when they start,” she says. “It is exactly like the preparation for a grand performance.” A global audience will be watching with interest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/31/12-ways-environment-development-sectors-work-together-sdgs","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-31T15:55:56Z","webTitle":"12 ways environment and development sectors can collaborate to meet the SDGs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/31/12-ways-environment-development-sectors-work-together-sdgs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/31/12-ways-environment-development-sectors-work-together-sdgs","fields":{"headline":"12 ways environment and development sectors can collaborate to meet the SDGs","bodyText":"1 | Think of environment and development as one sector Sectoral thinking is partly what will hinder us from meeting the sustainable development goals. The question is not how these sectors can collaborate, but how they can become increasingly intertwined to reflect the joined-up nature of the goals. A good example is the transformation from marine governance to ecosystem governance that took place in some countries when fisheries and environment ministries were reformed. Tim Daw, researcher – ecosystem services and poverty, Stockholm Resilience Centre, @sthlmresilience 2 | Develop trust Traditionally, we have often seen these two sectors as competing – with the notion that you had to sacrifice environmental quality for development. There has also been some scepticism from those within these two communities about the intentions or approaches of others. Economists have not always been welcomed in environmental circles and there is mistrust when it comes to issues that are important to so many. But we are seeing a more enlightened view. Both sides are working together and appreciating that by doing this we can achieve more than we could by working against each other. Oren Ahoobim, associate partner, Dalberg, @orenahoobim, @DalbergTweet 3 | Use the SDGs as a checklist We all recognise that we need a holistic approach, so perhaps industrial projects (eg dams and mining) could use the SDGs as a design checklist to ensure they do not cause negative impacts elsewhere and are a positive force for good. We use our One Planet Living framework in this way, which could really work for the SDGs. Sue Riddlestone, CEO and co-founder, Bioregional, @sueriddlestone, @bioregional 4 | Create financial incentives There are now 20 million artisanal and small-scale miners worldwide. They are responsible for about a tenth of all gold production, but they also do great environmental damage, accounting for the biggest single use of mercury that poisons land and drinking water supplies. The activity is hard to control as miners are widely dispersed, often operating illegally and in remote places. Last week, the GEF council approved a programme that will design and deploy ways in which miners in eight countries can get loans to switch from mercury. Robert Bisset, head of communications, Global Environment Facility, @robbiebisset, @theGEF 5 | Support social entrepreneurs We need business models where development aid and environmental grants are used to get things started, and then they need to stand on their own two feet as some sort of service or business. Social entrepreneurs are entering the development space with initiatives like this, for example, projects bringing solar power to villages in remote areas help development and address environmental issues. Sue Riddlestone 6 | Educate children about sustainability We need all children and students to know not to support unsustainable solutions, so that when they grow up – perhaps to be engineers or designers – they will discourage solutions that are unsustainable. The rest of us need to adopt this mindset; we can’t think we can have a growing business in a failing planet. Livia Bizikova, director – SDG Knowledge Programme, IISD, @LiviaBizik, @IISD_news 7 | Monitor industrial developments continually As well as the traditional tools used in environmental impact assessments, there is a key need for trustworthy oversight. A factory or mine may be designed to minimise environmental harm but unless someone is there to monitor emissions, standards might slip. This process of safeguarding and achieving the best development outcomes is set out in various documents (such as the African Development Bank’s Safeguard Policy). The key is to ensure they are implemented during and after construction as, unfortunately, when these major projects are operational, development practitioners have little or no influence. There is a key role for environmental NGOs here. Mike Webster, director, WasteAid UK, @michaelgwebster, @WasteAidUK 8 | Host cross-sectoral events I got to know some development NGOs at the UN general assembly and during the SDG process, but now the goals are being implementing, where do we meet up? Maybe the environment and development sectors need to have opportunities to get together more often. Sue Riddlestone 9 | Harness natural resources Virunga National Park authorities have acknowledged that the four million people who live outside the park will not stop entering it to cut down trees (for charcoal), hunt wildlife and graze cattle. The Virunga Alliance has helped install three hydroelectric dams that generate electricity for villages outside the park. Children can now study and women can walk with greater safety at night, and businesses are arriving in the region. The project has begun to promote better relations between the park’s rangers and the local people, while building peace, stability and hope in North Kivu province. By harnessing the natural power of the park, the authorities have made great inroads to protecting its exceptionally rich biodiversity. Alex Jones 10 | Promote context-specific technology In the Maasai village where I live, we now have solar energy installed for lights and charging points, and a solar water pump means children have time to do homework and women can take literacy classes. We have switched to clean cook stoves, using cow dung as fuel, and are about to install proper waste treatment because the wind blows in plastics from across the Mara. We have done this at a village scale, which is now being repeated across the Maasai, while keeping all the cultural elements of pastoralism and a semi-nomadic life. The Maasai may live in a world of no money and little food, but it is a world where the best technology can help ensure the future of an important indigenous people. Jacqueline McGlade, chief scientist, UN environment programme, @UNEP 11 | Tie funding to joint development and environmental outcomes The environment and development sectors will need to build on the objectives of each other to attract critical funding. This will require them to rethink and expand their work, but will present the opportunity to leverage each other in developing a larger value proposition. We are working with The Nature Conservancy to develop an insurance product to protect reefs facing the damaging impacts of storms. While the traditional approach to reef protection has been to seek public or donor funding to support biodiversity, there is a big opportunity to increase funding to this critical natural infrastructure by layering in development objectives. The reefs provide crucial protection and tourism for the communities and businesses behind them. Adam Connaker, program associate – innovative finance, The Rockefeller Foundation, @RockefellerFdn 12 | Promote the links between environment and sustainable development Early on, development was focused solely on economic growth, which was often achieved by extracting natural capital. Now there is growing recognition that nature serves as the foundation for development over the long term because natural systems support our food production, clean our water, regulate our climate, and safeguard the Earth’s biodiversity. The SDGs do a good job of integrating the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development.

This building designed by London-based Baca Architects has a unique feature – it floats. Completed this month, the amphibious house was developed as a prototype by Baca and Floating Homes, a manufacturer specialising in flood-resilient housing, in response to a competition launched last year to find a solution to London’s housing crisis. The house is intended to be practical, affordable (a two-bed unit will sell for £200,000) and equipped to deal with floods, by rising with the water levels. Ultimately the company wants to unlock redundant waterways by building on “bluespace” sites – manmade docks, canals and marinas – across London. “Collectively, bluespace has the potential to deliver as many as 7,500 floating homes with minimal disruption to existing communities”, says Richard Coutts, director at Baca Architects. Floating architecture has real potential to help ease some of London’s housing problems, says Alex De Rijke of dRMM architects, which won a competition to design the UK’s first floating villages in London Docklands. “Architecture can only respond to overpopulation by addressing the questions of density, economy and speed of construction,” says de Rijke, “The space of large rivers in urban areas can offer answers to these questions.” Architects and city planners across the world are starting to look beyond the traditional confines of the city, towards building on water as one of the answers to reducing inner-city population density and also developing flood-resilient designs. Global damage to cities from flooding could amount to $1tn a year by 2050 if no action is taken, according to a World Bank report. Floating architecture is nothing new. Traditional floating villages are common in deltas and along the Mekong river in south-east Asia. But integrating age-old designs into a modern city is a different matter entirely. Some cities are further ahead than others. IJBurg is a collection of floating houses built on six artificial islands on IJ Lake in Amsterdam, designed by Marlies Rohmer. It was conceived to deal with the city’s critical housing shortage problem as well as its vulnerability to flooding – more than half of the Netherlands is at or below sea level. The housing is a mix of expensive waterside condos and social housing, with about 30% of the community’s 18,000 houses allocated to low-income residents. When complete, the development will provide homes for 45,000 residents on 10 islands. In Copenhagen, architecture firm Urban Rigger has unveiled floating student housing made from end of life shipping containers. Each Urban Rigger has 12 studio apartments which share a courtyard complete with a BBQ area, bike racks and a kayak landing, and is powered in part by solar energy. Tethered to docks in the city, the first students are due to move at the end of the year and will pay around £500-£600 a month. Over the next decade, the company plans to build 1,000-1,500 containers in “harbour, canal and river intensive cities” across Europe, says founder Kim Loudrup. It’s about “using infrastructure that’s not being used for anything apart from looking nice”, says Loudrop, who admits floating housing is “only part of the puzzle” when it comes to solving city housing crises. The beauty is, he says, that this kind of housing “can be initialised and utilised immediately; it comes in, stays for a period of time and then can move away again.” Building on water isn’t straightforward, however. The recent collapse of the Makoko Floating School in Lagos, one of the most famous examples of floating architecture, shows some of the complexities. The award-winning lagoon structure designed by Nigerian architect Kunlé Adeyemi of Dutch studio NLÉ Works was built to provide a school and community centre to a floating slum in the city but collapsed in June after heavy rainfall. Adeyemi says that the building had been decommissioned for months and was only intended as a prototype. But it led to a row as a local headmaster, Noah Shemede, raised concerns about the viability of the structure. There are also environmental concerns. The need for foundations of many floating buildings to go deep into the river bed, for example, will have an impact on the environment, says Phillip Mills, director of the Policy Consulting Network, and a specialist in water construction. “Foundations or structures within the river could also alter the river bed with silt erosion and deposition elsewhere in the river. The same thing already happens around bridge piers,” he says. Building floating structures can also severely alter the flow of a river such as the Thames and disrupt transport, a spokesperson from the Port of London Authority explains. “What might suit property owners or private developers best is not always best for the city. Londoners have said they want to see the Thames used predominantly for transport or leisure. Any structures in the Thames could impact the flow of the river and create obstacles for watercraft.” However, Lucy Bullivant, adjunct professor of history and theory of urban design at Syracuse University, thinks there are greater environmental consequences building on land – such as the tendency to be more car focused – than on rivers. “Floating designs will create a good anchor point for plants to help foster biodiversity and create habitats for fish and birds.” Building on bluefield sights can be environmentally friendly, according to Mark Junak, director of Floating Homes. He says floating structures such as those at Noorderhaven in the Netherlands have recently been subject to underwater drone surveys to observe whether their construction has negatively affected the ecosystem. According to the research project, the underwater footage “revealed the existence of a dynamic and diverse aquatic habitat in the vicinity of these structures, showing that floating structures can have a positive effect on the aquatic environment”. For London architect Carl Turner, who has designed a pre-fabricated, open-source amphibious house specifically designed to float on floodwater, called the Floating House, climate change means needing to work with water. “You either protect the house or protect the land,” he says. “Creating large-scale flood protection zones is expensive and in itself potentially harmful to the environment. Once breached, homes are left defenceless, as opposed to floating homes that can simply rise with flood waters.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2016/jun/01/renewable-energy-smashes-global-records-in-2015-report-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-01T14:32:13Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy smashes global records in 2015, report shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/01/renewable-energy-smashes-global-records-in-2015-report-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jun/01/renewable-energy-smashes-global-records-in-2015-report-shows","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy smashes global records in 2015, report shows","bodyText":"An upsurge in new wind, solar and hydro plants and capacity saw renewable energy smash global records last year, according to a report on new supply. Some 147 Gigawatts of renewable electricity came online in 2015 - the largest annual increase ever and as much as Africa’s entire power generating capacity. Clean energy investment increased to $286bn (£198bn), with solar energy accounting for 56% of the total and wind power for 38%. Overall, more than twice as much money was spent on renewables than on coal and gas-fired power generation ($130bn in 2015), the REN21 global status report found. Christine Lins, REN21’s chief, said: “What is truly remarkable about these results is that they were achieved at a time when fossil fuel prices were at historic lows, and renewables remained at a significant disadvantage in terms of government subsidies. For every dollar spent boosting renewables, nearly four dollars were spent to maintain our dependence on fossil fuels.” For the first time, emerging economies outspent richer nations in the green energy race, with China accounting for a third of the global total. Jamaica, Honduras, Uruguay and Mauritania were among the highest investors, relative to their GDP. African and Latin American countries also set some of the world’s most ambitious targets for clean energy deployment last year, the report says. But the renewables revolution stuttered in many developed countries, with the significant exception of the US. In Europe, investment plummeted by 21% after the withdrawal of policy supports, such as clean energy subsidies and binding targets. Despite this, renewables still provide 44% of the EU’s electricity capacity, and 15% of its final energy consumption. Jean-François Fauconnier of Climate Action Network Europe said the report should be a “wake up call” to the European commission, spurring increased 2030 renewable goals in a review later this year. “The EU is at risk of missing the ongoing energy revolution and lagging behind other leading economies for decades,” he said. The UK saw a 25% rise in renewable energy investments last year, the paper finds. But figures for the first quarter of 2016 suggest this may not survive cuts to solar subsidies and a slowdown in onshore wind planning approvals. Industry reactions to the REN21 paper were buoyant, with the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) hailing news that 173 countries now have renewable energy targets. Steve Sawyer, GWEC’s secretary general said: “A record 63.5 GW of wind power was installed worldwide in 2015, demonstrating the maturity of the sector; and showing how renewables are supplying competitive, reliable and clean energy to fuel economic growth and cut CO2 emissions.” Around the world, 8.1million people are now employed in the clean energy industry - excluding hydropower - 3.5 million of them in China. In the US, more people now work in the solar industry than in oil and gas extraction. While employment in the clean energy sector grew by 6% in 2015, jobs in the oil industry contracted by 18%, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. But the fast-maturing renewables sector still has to overcome storage limitations, and the world’s dependence on infrastructure systems geared towards fossil fuels. Arthouros Zervos, the chair of REN21 said: “The renewables train is barreling down the tracks, but it is running on 20th-century infrastructure – a system based on outdated thinking where conventional baseload is generated by fossil fuels and nuclear power.” A build-out of decentralised and community-based generation was urgently needed to accelerate the clean energy transition, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2016/jul/28/the-switch-chris-goodall-review-solar-power-taking-over","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-28T13:59:08Z","webTitle":"The Switch by Chris Goodall – solar power is finally taking over","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/28/the-switch-chris-goodall-review-solar-power-taking-over","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/jul/28/the-switch-chris-goodall-review-solar-power-taking-over","fields":{"headline":"The Switch by Chris Goodall – solar power is finally taking over","bodyText":"A sense of drift and apathy has pervaded the global warming and renewable energy debate for too long. The fossil fuel companies continue to dig coal and pump oil and gas; herbivorous idealists, scientists and ecowarriors emit their ritual opposition. The carbon load forced into the atmosphere continues to rise, and the general public seems resigned. But 2016 is the year this will really begin to change. Chris Goodall’s book is wonderfully up to date but, thanks to the pace of change, even he couldn’t keep up with the avalanche of news and initiatives conspiring to justify his subtitle. In May, Shell announced a major move into renewables; on 15 May Germany received almost all its electricity from renewables; for four days from 7 to 10 May Portugal did the same. Goodall, who is an economist rather than a technologist or ecowarrior, explains why the change is happening now: the cost of solar electricity is falling much faster than anyone predicted. Solar power is approaching parity with fossil fuels and can only become cheaper as time goes by. Sunny Portugal might run fossil-free for four days but what happens when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind refuses to blow? The recent Ren21 global status report, while reporting that clean energy investment in 2015 ($286bn, or £217bn) was more than double that for fossil fuels ($130bn, or £99bn), added the rider: “But the fast-maturing renewables sector still has to overcome storage limitations and the world’s dependence on infrastructure systems geared towards fossil fuels.” In the latter part of the book Goodall addresses this, explaining the missing factor – the final piece of the puzzle. Goodall writes that the sun supplies enough power in 90 minutes to meet the world’s total energy needs for a year. When solar and wind installations reach a certain critical level, there will be periods when they produce far more energy than can be used. Electricity cannot itself be stored but that surplus electricity and indeed sunlight itself can be used to create liquid hydrocarbons for fuel, plastics and other chemicals and methane to drive gas-fired power stations at times when renewable output dips. This is not a pipe dream. An exciting project, launched as the Global Apollo programme in 2015 and taken up, thanks to Bill Gates’ ministrations, by 20 major governments at the Paris climate conference in December 2015, is to produce liquid fuels and methane directly from carbon dioxide using sunlight – in effect, mimicking the photosynthesis that every plant accomplishes so easily. David Attenborough, one of the founders of the Global Apollo programme, has said: “If we could put a man on the moon in 10 years you mean to say we can’t solve the problem of getting one 500th part of the energy from the sun? It’s really a tiny technological problem.” It isn’t quite such a tiny problem, but lab scientists such as Peidong Yang at Berkeley and commercial companies such as LanzaTech in the US and Carbon Recycling International in Iceland are already showing the way. The surplus solar energy of summer will be squirrelled away into liquid fuel and gas for winter, rather as the sun’s past bounty produced the surplus we now consume as fossil fuels. And this project has the backing of scientists, technologists, economists, governments, great foundations, major investors and even giant energy companies from the fossil era (because the liquid fuels and gas will use the existing infrastructure: a huge economic boon). The “switch” is coming. It will probably take 20 years to make a major impact, but we should see the first fruits very soon. This book is the essential guide to this great benign change, although I could have done with some sense of the grandeur of what we are on the verge of achieving. For 4.5bn years, light has been pouring down on the earth, creating and sustaining the cornucopia of life. For two and a half centuries we have been living off hundreds of millions of years of stored sunlight. And for over half a century, scientists have been working to unlock the secrets of plant photosynthesis. This is now known down to the last atom, and this achievement should rank with Watson and Crick’s elucidation of the DNA structure. It’s time to put that knowledge to work for us. • To order The Switch for £8.19 (RRP £9.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846. Free UK p&amp;p over £10, online orders only.

The American Legislative Exchange Council – Alec – is a neoconservative organisation with close links to members of the Tea Party movement. Championed by supporters of the free market, it has been attacked by critics for exerting a “powerful and undemocratic” influence on US politics. It is part funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, David and Charles, whose empire spans mining, chemicals and finance. Leadsom’s links to the council will be scrutinised closely by those trying to gauge her political leanings. In the US the council produces hundreds of putative bills that it seeks to have made into law by US legislators who attend its conferences, where they are treated to generous corporate hospitality at lavish cigar parties. Alec has built a web of relationships with politicians around the world. In the UK these include the Ukip MEP Roger Helmer and the Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan, who played a large part in the Vote Leave campaign. The council, which promotes privatisation and seeks to curtail union power, is fiercely opposed to the European Union and regularly meets European politicians who seek to check the power of the union, fearing its ideas could spread across the Atlantic. Alec’s national chairman, Earl Ehrhart, warned in 2005 that “the threats posed by the European constitution can easily be transported over here – the threats to free trade, free markets and individual liberty”. Such measures, Alec claims, would hurt American business and stifle job creation. But its critics disagree. “Alec has clearly set its sights on promoting its agenda in Europe and in particular it has targeted politicians from the UK,” said Nick Surgey, director of research at the Center for Media and Democracy in the US. “Austerity under the Alec vision for the world is far more extreme than anything that the UK has seen under Cameron.” Filings with the Electoral Commission show that in 2008, two years before she became an MP, Leadsom attended “exchange meetings” with Alec in Washington and Chicago. Alec picked up the £1,800 bill. Mark Pocan, a US legislator who attended the 2008 conference, recounted how guests were told that global warming was “a huge, huge myth”. “At least two workshops addressed this issue,” he wrote in an account of his experiences, “one titled Taking the Politics Out of Science, and the other about New Energy Technologies in a Carbon Constrained World.” The first workshop tried to point out inaccuracies about global warming and other “junk” science. The second was designed to talk up “clean coal” options and to make the point that CO2 emissions are “not all bad”. Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth US, said: “Alec has been behind some of the most anti-environmental climate regulation attacks in the US for quite some time. “They’ve tried to pass anti-science legislation at the state level which would ban officials from talking and addressing climate change, they’ve attacked renewable energy standards to promote wind and solar energy efficiency, and they have worked to increase and prevent any kind of regulatory action against the oil and gas industry.” In the year that Leadsom attended the council’s conference it was promoting a notorious bill across US states. The “Stand Your Ground” law, backed by the National Rifle Association, which gave gun owners new rights to protect and defend themselves, was heavily criticised following the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager in Florida. Alec’s support for the law ultimately led to the departure from the council of high-profile corporate members such as Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Bank of America and General Motors. Of its former relationship with Alec, the Google chairman, Eric Schmidt, has declared: “I think the consensus within the company was that that was some sort of mistake.” Transparency campaigners called on Leadsom to distance herself from the council. “It’s a powerful and profoundly undemocratic force in US politics,” said Tamasin Cave, of Spinwatch. “Why did Leadsom get involved with this lot? Who invited her, and why?” A spokesman for Leadsom declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/nov/04/adam-liaw-five-scientific-developments-that-will-change-the-way-we-eat","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-03T20:27:45Z","webTitle":"Adam Liaw: five scientific developments that will change the way we eat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/nov/04/adam-liaw-five-scientific-developments-that-will-change-the-way-we-eat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/nov/04/adam-liaw-five-scientific-developments-that-will-change-the-way-we-eat","fields":{"headline":"Adam Liaw: five scientific developments that will change the way we eat","bodyText":"Bacon-lovers wailed and gnashed their teeth last week when processed meats were declared carcinogenic, but that’s not the half of it. Here are five recent scientific developments that will have an enormous impact on the way people eat. The WHO v red meat The World Health Organisation announced last week that processed meats were now considered category 1 carcinogens alongside alcohol and cigarettes, but it’s the footnote to that story that will have bigger consequences for the future of our diets. It labelled all red meat a category 2A carcinogen, and from the WHO that is BIG. All the commercials we grew up with touting the iron content and health benefits of lean red meat aren’t going to be quite the same if they have to add “and will probably give you cancer” at the end. Health-conscious paleo dieters may even want to rethink their obsession with grass-fed beef, or risk prioritising their summer beach bodies over avoiding bowel cancer. For most of us (myself included), the taste of a good steak or chop is enough to make us not worry too much about ill health effects, but still, after decades of red meat clawing its way into first-world life as an everyday food, the case against it is building faster than ever. The fat taste Say hello to oleogustus. That’s the proposed name for the “fat taste” that looks set to be added to salt, sweet, sour, bitter and umami to take the number of basic human tastes to six. The idea that humans can taste fat may seem straightforward, but most of what we associate with fat is its texture or aroma. That most of us can taste it without those other aspects is a big deal. Oleogustus gives us the delicious, morish taste of butter and it helps us tell if oils have turned rancid. Still not impressed? Well, the last time we added to our list of basic tastes was more than 100 years ago, when Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda discovered umami, the savoury “fifth taste” that revolutionised the food industry from potato chips to stock cubes. Oleogustus probably won’t be as revolutionary as umami, but it might lead to better-tasting butter, or more convincing natural or artificial flavours. It might give us richer, creamier-tasting milk, or even Willy Wonka-esque pills that taste like a three-course dinner. Your microbiome If you’ve ever felt not quite yourself, it might be because, scientifically speaking, you’re actually not. Everyone carries around billions of bacterial cells in their stomach and intestines – some bad, but many good – and these cells substantially outnumber our own human ones. Together they are known as our microbiome, and there’s a growing consensus in science that they plays an enormous role in our health. Irrespective of how healthy we try to be, our microbiome may be responsible for whether we are skinny or fat, how prone we are to diabetes, or our food allergies. A course of antibiotics you took as a child to fix a simple lurgy might have inadvertently knocked about your gut bacteria and set you up for a lifetime of weight gain and health problems. The more important the microbiome becomes, the less we will want bacteria-killing preservatives, and we will probably want to return to more traditional fermented foods common in relatively healthy countries such as Japan and Korea. It may even mean a huge boom in supercharged probiotics. Imagine a daily glass of bacteria-filled milk that could help you lose weight or manage serious illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease. GMO safety Since their introduction to our food systems in 1996, genetically modified organisms have been controversial. Most opposition has been around the idea that we don’t know enough about the long terms effects of GMOs to consider them safe. In late 2014, a study at the University of California, Davis, analysed 29 years of data from more than 100 billion livestock animals eating trillions of meals of GMO feed. It broadly concluded that GMO feed was safe and nutritionally identical to non-GMO feed. Of course this was not a study on humans, but up to 90% of GMOs produced are used as animal feed, so it is hugely relevant. The study further suggested there were no adverse affects from humans who consumed meat and other products from the GMO-fed animals. Whether you consider this to be conclusive proof that GMOs are safe or not, it’s a huge step towards eroding the fear that we don’t know enough about them. This may make it less likely that GMO-containing foods will be subject to mandatory labelling and more likely that we will see more GMO foods for human consumption. And if we get really comfortable with GMOs, who knows? Anyone for glow-in-the-dark fish and chips? Throwing out the ‘food pyramid’ Many of us grew up being taught some version of the “food pyramid” – a simple visual guide that promoted breads and cereals as the foundation of a healthy diet, with fats at the pointy end. It wasn’t perfect, but was persuasive for generations of people striving for a healthier diet. Now the 20th century food pyramid is a relic of the past. The US dumped its pyramid for the MyPlate guide in 2011. Australia’s Healthy Eating Pyramid has undergone a drastic revision, with fruit and vegetables replacing carbohydrates as the basis of a balanced meal. In June, Public Health England’s scientific advisory committee on nutrition released the results of its seven-year study into carbohydrates and health. Those results put sugar squarely in the crosshairs, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that rather than fat, the more problematic elements of our diet involve refined sugars and other processed carbohydrates. It has already prompted calls for amendments to the UK’s Eatwell Plate. The rise of anti-sugar thinking has all but obliterated the influence of low-fat-high-sugar “health” foods of the late 20th century, but our dependence on processed carbohydrates has been much harder to shake. How we end up doing so may well be the most significant impact on the way humans eat that we have seen in a thousand years. Substituted dishes such as cauliflower “rice”, zucchini “spaghetti” and bunless hamburgers mimic the form, if not the function, of a traditional carbohydrate-based diet. But these stop-gap dishes are unlikely to persist for too long, and as we become more comfortable with reducing the influence of refined carbohydrates in our diet, traditional foods that go back centuries may find themselves out of date. So much of the way we think about food is with carbohydrates at the base. Pasta, rice, bread and potatoes were the foundation for our idea of health, but also for our culinary culture. What will modern Italian food look like if pasta is marginalised? What about a packed lunch if sandwiches are considered less than ideal? Reducing refined carbohydrates isn’t just for health nuts any more, and that means big changes are coming to the very core of our cuisine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/06/pew-survey-republicans-are-rejecting-reality-on-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-06T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"Pew survey: Republicans are rejecting reality on climate change | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/06/pew-survey-republicans-are-rejecting-reality-on-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/06/pew-survey-republicans-are-rejecting-reality-on-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Pew survey: Republicans are rejecting reality on climate change","bodyText":"Climate scientists have 95% confidence that humans are the main cause of global warming over the past six decades. Their best estimate attributes 100% of global warming since 1950 to human activities. 90 to 100% of climate scientists and their research agree on this. Human-caused global warming is as settled as science gets. Yet most Americans don’t realize it. Moreover, the more conservative a person’s ideology, the less likely they are to accept this scientific reality or to trust the scientific experts. According to a new Pew Research Center poll, just 48% of Americans realize that the Earth is warming mostly due to human activity. Highlighting a vast partisan reality gap, 79% of liberal Democrats and just 15% of conservative Republicans answer the question correctly. Science knowledge matters for Democrats, but not Republicans Among social scientists, there’s an ongoing debate about whether facts can change peoples’ minds on scientific issues that have become politically polarized, like climate change. There’s some evidence that when conservatives have more scientific knowledge, it just gives them more tools to use in rejecting the scientific information that conflicts with their ideological beliefs. Pew asked a variety of general science questions to test the correlation between scientific knowledge and acceptance of human-caused global warming. Overall, Democrats and Republicans got the same average score on these scientific questions, although liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans scored better than moderates in both parties. When it came to understanding that humans are causing global warming, Pew found that scientific knowledge makes a huge difference among Democrats, and no difference among Republicans. However, previous research has shown that conservatives with climate-specific knowledge are more likely to accept climate realities. For Democrats, ideology isn’t a factor because the main solutions to the problem (e.g. regulations and pollution taxes) don’t conflict with their ideological beliefs. Thus scientific knowledge determines whether they understand that humans are causing global warming. For three-quarters of American conservatives, their ideology prevents them from accepting that reality, regardless of their scientific literacy. Republicans distrust climate science experts The expert consensus on human-caused global warming poses a conundrum for conservatives. People usually defer to the experts, in particular on complex issues like climate science. How can they square an ideological opposition to climate change solutions with the 97% consensus among scientific experts that humans are causing global warming? The Pew survey suggests that conservatives accomplish this by denying the expert consensus, and by distrusting the experts. The poll asked whether respondents thought that “almost all climate scientists agree that human behavior is mostly responsible for climate change.” Only 27% of Americans were aware of this fact, including just 55% of liberal democrats, 29% of moderate Democrats, and 15% of Republicans. When asked if climate scientists can be trusted to give full and accurate information on the causes of climate change, only 39% of Americans answered yes, including 70% of liberal Democrats and 15% of conservative Republicans. More than half of conservative Republicans also said that climate scientists’ research findings are influenced by the desire to advance their careers and their political leanings. In short, when experts tell you something you don’t want to believe, reject their conclusions by accusing them of bias, as we saw conservative Australian senator Malcolm Roberts do recently on Q &amp; A: Conservative media and politicians created an echo chamber of denial Research has shown that American conservative media outlets like the Wall Street Journal and Fox News are terribly inaccurate and biased in their climate change reporting. In fact, a study in 2013 found that conservative media consumption decreases viewer trust in scientists and belief that global warming is happening. The Pew survey results further reinforce that finding. Moreover, a study published last year found that the Republican Party is the only major political party in the world that rejects the need to tackle climate change. This is likely due to the party’s reliance on fossil fuel industry campaign donations. Humans are causing global warming. Scientific experts agree about this. Smoking causes lung cancer. Gravity is real. Humans landed on the moon. These are all statements that reflect the reality we all live in whether we’re politically liberal or conservative. Political ideology should not determine whether we accept these realities. And yet in America, on climate change, it does. The Republican Party has created an echo chamber in which their media and political leaders live by the phrase jokingly uttered by Mythbuster Adam Savage: Republican voters take their cues from party leaders and often get their information from conservative media outlets. On climate change, those leaders and media sources reject reality and substitute their own denial and misinformation, because it benefits them. Their voters become misinformed as a result, and thus don’t demand change from party leaders. Everybody outside the denial echo chamber is puzzled by it, and since it’s impervious to external facts, few know how to break through. Piercing the echo chamber Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe has been trying to make a difference by identifying commonalities with many conservatives, like her evangelical faith. There are glimmers of hope in the Pew survey. For example, there’s bipartisan support for wind and solar energy, with 83% and 89% of Americans in favor, respectively. As Hayhoe noted in her climate event with President Obama and Leonardo DiCaprio this week, Texas produces the most wind power of any state, generating 10% of its electricity from wind. Because they’re becoming increasingly cheap and popular, clean technologies are giving us a shot at preventing the worst consequences of climate change. Much like climate change, science denial poses a long-term threat to the Republican Party. And similar to alcoholism, denying the problem doesn’t make it go away; if you don’t accept the problem and take steps to deal with it, reality will eventually come crashing in with disastrous consequences. There are conservative thought leaders who realize this and are in a battle with the science-denying wing over the future of the Republican Party. With reality on their side, they will eventually win; hopefully before too much irreversible damage is done to the party and to the Earth’s climate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/25/ikea-starts-selling-solar-panels-in-uk-stores","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-25T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"Ikea starts selling solar panels in UK stores","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/25/ikea-starts-selling-solar-panels-in-uk-stores","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/25/ikea-starts-selling-solar-panels-in-uk-stores","fields":{"headline":"Ikea starts selling solar panels in UK stores","bodyText":"Solar panels will join tea lights and spider plants on sale at Ikea stores from Monday, despite huge government cuts to solar subsidies for homeowners. Shoppers will be able to order panels online and at three stores, initially Glasgow, Birmingham and Lakeside, before the so-called Solar Shops appear in all the Swedish company’s UK stores by summer’s end. Ikea’s new foray with energy company SolarCentury marks its second attempt to sell solar panels, after a two-year pilot with Chinese company Hanergy ended last year. The company maintains that despite low wholesale electricity prices and ministers’ 65% cut to solar incentives, after which new solar installations have crashed in the past two months, the technology makes sense for British householders. “Obviously the climate has been changing in the past year in the UK but, nonetheless, our research showed a third of homeowners would really like to invest in solar, and the majority of those are driven by the opportunity to save money,” said Joanna Yarrow, head of sustainability at Ikea UK and Ireland. “Even though the feed-in tariff rate has come down, you’re still going to get a 6% rate of return on a solar installation, you’re not going to get that return on an ISA.” She admitted it was “depressing” to see the recent 75% fall in solar power capacity installed by homeowners but said “we see solar as the future”. Research by Ikea found of the one-third of people who wanted solar, 60% did so because of savings on electricity bills, and that the average solar install should cut buyers’ electricity bills by half. A typical system for a semi-detached house with 10 panels would cost from £4,550, the company said. The partnership with SolarCentury differs from its previous one with Hanergy, in which the troubled Chinese supplier operated what were in effect in-store concessions. This time, Ikea employees will handle sales in stores, and the company expects panels to be installed within six weeks of a buyer’s initial inquiry. Hanergy also only sold panels through Ikea with thin film technology, which Yarrow said only about 5% of the market had wanted, but under the new deal the company will be selling polycrystalline and monocrystalline panels. Yarrow said the latter was more efficient and had a better aesthetic. John Sauven, Greenpeace UK’s director, welcomed Ikea’s solar venture, saying: “Over the past decade things have changed dramatically as the price has come down and the efficiency, even in cloudy skies, has gone up. Now solar power is widespread enough for most of us to know someone who’s chosen to invest.” Solar energy recently passed an important milestone in the UK when it provided more power than coal to homes and businesses for a day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/may/13/could-this-be-the-worlds-most-efficient-solar-electricity-system","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Could this be the world's most efficient solar electricity system?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/13/could-this-be-the-worlds-most-efficient-solar-electricity-system","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/may/13/could-this-be-the-worlds-most-efficient-solar-electricity-system","fields":{"headline":"Could this be the world's most efficient solar electricity system?","bodyText":"A new solar electricity generation system that developers claim is the most efficient in the world, is being tested in South Africa’s Kalahari desert. The Swedish company behind the project - which combines military technology with an idea developed by a 19th-century Scottish engineer and clergyman - says it is on the verge of building its first commercial installation. In the remote Northern Cape province, huge mirrors reflect the sun across the brown Kalahari sand. This is the test site for Swedish company Ripasso, which is using the intense South African sun and local manufacturing know-how to develop their cutting-edge kit. “Our whole team in South Africa has been hired locally, and our new systems have all been built with local South African labour. It works great,” says CEO Gunnar Larsson. This is one of the few operational small-scale concentrated solar energy systems of its kind in the world. 34% of the sun’s energy hitting the mirrors is converted directly to grid-available electric power, compared to roughly half that for standard solar panels. Traditional photovoltaic panels are able to turn as much as 23% of the solar energy that strikes them into electricity, but the average output for most systems is about 15% directly usable by the grid. Jean-Pierre Fourie is Ripasso’s South African site manager. His crew has been testing the system in the Kalahari under harsh desert conditions for four years. “What we hope is to become one of the biggest competitors for renewable energy in the world.” The massive 100 square metre dishes slowly rotate, following the sun. Light clicks and taps fill the still desert air as they constantly adjust to capture the maximum solar energy. Independent tests by IT Power in the UK confirm that a single Ripasso dish can generate 75 to 85 megawatt hours of electricity a year - enough to power 24 typical UK homes. To make the same amount of electricity by burning coal would mean releasing roughly 81 metric tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. Paul Gauche, director of the Solar Thermal Energy Research Group at the University of Stellenbosch has visited the test site many times. “The technology looks good to me. I’ve seen it working and I believe it meets the efficiency goals. The technology is proven with years of performance in the navy.” He points out that it will be crucial to keep costs low enough to compete with photovoltaics, a significant challenge as their price falls every year. The system is also limited in that it is only useful in areas with consistent bright sunshine. The technology works by using the mirrors as giant lenses that focus the sun’s energy to a tiny hot point, which in turn drives a zero-emission Stirling engine. The Stirling engine was developed by Reverend Robert Stirling in Edinburgh in 1816 as an alternative to the steam engine. It uses alternate heating and cooling of an enclosed gas to drive pistons, which turn a flywheel. Because of the material limitations at the time, the advanced stirling engine that Ripasso uses was not commercially developed until 1988, when Swedish defence contractor Kokums started making them for submarines. Larsson worked in the Swedish defence industry for 20 years and realised what a clean and efficient generator could mean for renewable energy systems. He wanted to bring the technology from the depths of the ocean into the sunshine, so he resigned as CEO of Kokums and licensed the technology to start Ripasso. “When I founded the company in 2008 my youngest son came to me and said, wow daddy I am so proud of you, now I can tell everyone what you are doing, you are going to save the world instead of destroying it.” The project has not been without its troubles. “Our major challenge over the last couple of years has been to get the technology accepted by the financing community, especially from the banks,” says Larsson. Although banks have been unwilling to finance such novel technology, Ripasso has now secured private funding to begin their first large-scale installation. “We are very ready to head into the commercial phase,” says Larsson.

At an oil and natural gas conference in North Dakota on Thursday, just minutes after he had celebrated hitting the 1,237 delegate mark needed to formally clinch the party’s nomination, Trump gave a speech on energy policy that was largely shaped by advice from Kevin Cramer, a US representative from the state. In a press conference before the event, Trump praised the advice of oil tycoon Harold Hamm. Hamm and Cramer then introduced him onstage. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club environmentalist group, was taken aback by Trump’s address. “I have never heard more contradiction in one hour than I heard in the speech,” he told the Guardian. “There are pools of oil industry waste water that are deeper than Trump’s grasp of energy.” Trump gave the speech – which Brune also called “a jumbled collection of oil industry talking points that are devoid from reality in the market place” – in a packed arena that generated an atmosphere more like that of a campaign rally than a staid industry conference. As he hit a number of familiar talking points, a crowd filled with his supporters raised chants of “build the wall”. He did not directly address manmade climate change, which he has in the past called a hoax invented by the Chinese, but he took veiled shots at those who are concerned about global warming. In addition to his pledge to pull out of the Paris climate deal, Trump promised to only work with “environmentalists whose only agenda is protecting nature” and to “focus on real environmental challenges, not the phony ones”. He contrasted this approach with that of Hillary Clinton, whose plan to combat climate change he called “a poverty expansion agenda”. Trump also attacked renewable energy sources, claiming that solar energy was too expensive and attacking wind turbines for “killing eagles”. Without outlining any policy specifics, Trump argued for a focus on clean water and clean air. In January, asked by the Guardian about the Flint water contamination crisis, he said: “A thing like that shouldn’t happen but, again, I don’t want to comment on that.” On Thursday, Trump also made a unique argument about the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would pump shale oil from Canada into the US. Republicans have long supported the pipeline, which was opposed by environmentalists and cancelled by the Obama administration. In exchange for his approval of the pipeline, Trump said, the US would need a “significant piece” of its profits. Shortly after that statement, though, Trump said: “The government should not pick winners and losers.” Trump also seemed unsure whether high oil prices were good or bad. Although at one point in his speech he took credit for oil hitting $50 a barrel, he later enthused about the need for cheap energy. The crowd in Bismarck did not seem confused, though. Cheering wildly, they gave Trump a spontaneous standing ovation. “I will give you everything,” he promised them, adding: “I am the only one who will deliver.” They seemed to believe it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/may/27/green-energy-industrial-scale-wyke-farms-cheddar","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-27T04:00:22Z","webTitle":"The west country cheddar maker powered by solar and cow dung","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/27/green-energy-industrial-scale-wyke-farms-cheddar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/27/green-energy-industrial-scale-wyke-farms-cheddar","fields":{"headline":"The west country cheddar maker powered by solar and cow dung","bodyText":"“My grandparents used to tell me that if you look after nature, then nature will look after you,” says Richard Clothier, managing director of Wyke Farms, which generates electricity, gas and heat from renewable sources. “It’s nice to go to work in the morning and know you are doing the right thing.” The dairy business in southwest England, which exports 14,000 tonnes of cheddar a year to more than 160 countries, has been building an energy generation and water recycling operation over the past five years to reduce its environmental impact and save money. According to Clothier, it’s been able to lower its energy bills by nearly £100,000 per month as a result. Aside from solar panels, Wyke generates electricity and heat from cow dung. Using microbes, the dung is broken down to produce biogas, which the farm burns to generate electricity and heat. Since dung naturally releases methane during decomposition, the process of producing biogas helps the farm cut the amount of methane – a potent greenhouse gas – reaching the atmosphere. In addition, the cheese maker converts some of the biogas into biomethane, the majority of which it sells to businesses – including the supermarket chain Sainsbury’s – via a local utility’s pipelines. Wyke’s reliance on solar and biogas isn’t unusual for an agricultural business. What sets Wyke’s plan apart is its scale and complexity. The company is putting in place software to monitor energy generation and wastewater recycling, which can figure out the business’s needs and adjust the energy generation accordingly. What’s more, the company – which invested £5m in biomethane generation – is taking a risk by counting on signing up customers willing to pay more for low-carbon energy when natural gas remains abundant and cheap. “Perhaps [Wyke will prove to] have the foresight that pays dividends over the long run,” says David Babson, a senior engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a US nonprofit science advocacy group. “I hope that’s the case because you want to establish policies that incentivise the right behaviour.” While it’s difficult to say for certain when the biomethane business will start to deliver a return, Clothier hopes the payback period won’t be more than five or six years. To build its alternative energy operation, the dairy business has borrowed £11m from Barclays and put in £2m of its own money to cover the cost of planning, equipment, wiring and electric grid upgrades. Wyke can use the government’s renewable energy incentives to defray costs but it would get greater benefits by storing and using the renewable energy it generates on-farm because buying electricity from a local utility would cost 7.5 pence more per kilowatt-hour, says Clothier. As a result, Wyke is looking to boost the farm’s solar energy generation and adding batteries. The farm is also eligible to receive government incentives for producing biomethane and recovering and using heat from its biogas-fed power plants. The dairy business, which employs 225 people and expects to post about £2m in profit on £75m in revenue this year, hopes to inspire fellow farmers to adopt alternative energy. “I’m really keen to show our farmers what they can do,” says Clothier. “They can start with a couple of solar panels to reduce [their] daytime usage. You can start by doing just a little bit”. Wyke Farms is the 2016 winner in the carbon and energy management category of the Guardian Sustainable Business Awards."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2017/jan/19/reasons-to-be-cheerful-full-switch-low-carbon-energy-in-sight","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-19T06:30:29Z","webTitle":"Reasons to be cheerful: a full switch to low-carbon energy is in sight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/19/reasons-to-be-cheerful-full-switch-low-carbon-energy-in-sight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jan/19/reasons-to-be-cheerful-full-switch-low-carbon-energy-in-sight","fields":{"headline":"Reasons to be cheerful: a full switch to low-carbon energy is in sight","bodyText":"My first book on climate change was published 10 years ago. I looked at how responsible individuals could choose to run their lives to cut their carbon footprint. Inevitably minimising your carbon footprint meant making some uncomfortable choices – stopping eating meat, for example, or giving up flying. Hair-shirtism, in short. In 2009, I advised individuals on how they could cut their carbon emissions by 10%. I then disobeyed some of my own recommendations, flying to the US to visit a daughter at university, for example. Over the subsequent years, it increasingly seemed to me that changing western lifestyles in the way my first book suggested was going to be an impossible struggle. Moreover, the world still had more than a billion people without an electricity supply. Any solution that didn’t give them access to power was unfair and unworkable. So I switched to writing about how we could substitute low-carbon energy sources for fossil fuels. At first it seemed that renewable electricity would always be more expensive and solar power would languish unless it was heavily subsidised. Using alternative energy sources seemed difficult, expensive and inconvenient. I now think I was completely wrong. In fact, optimism about successfully tackling climate change has never been more justified because 2016 was the year in which it finally became obvious that the world had the technology to solve the problem. Even as the political environment has darkened, the reasons have strengthened for believing that a complete transition to low-carbon energy is practical and affordable within one generation. Andrew Simms is right that global temperatures will probably overshoot the 2C target. But that makes the urgency of an energy transition even clearer. Despair is no excuse for inaction. Solar power costs around the world fell by an average of another 15% in 2016, meaning that electricity from the sun became the cheapest form of energy generation in places as diverse as Chile, parts of the Middle East and the south-west of the US. The world saw the lowest-ever auction price for solar electricity in Abu Dhabi. China committed to adding about 40 gigawatts annually of solar panels in the next few years, more than half the new capacity installed across the entire world in 2016. India made similarly ambitious plans, meaning that these two countries will put more solar on the ground than the entire world did a couple of years ago. As more photovoltaics are installed, costs fall in a predictable way, so that the drive towards using solar energy in Asia and elsewhere will feed through to lower prices across the whole world, including the UK. Even in gloomy Britain, the government now sees solar photovoltaics delivering electricity at less than 2% more than a new gas-fired power station in 2020, with costs continuing to fall thereafter. In sunny places around the world, solar may fall to less than half the price of fossil electricity within a decade. Progress hasn’t been restricted to wealthier countries. In places without access to electricity grids, new businesses grew offering pay-as-you-go access to solar electricity. Radically new approaches to solar technologies also saw major progress in 2016. The Dresden company Heliatek raised the money to build a new factory producing solar film that is printed on plastic backing and which can be simply pinned to the walls of buildings. Investors backed Oxford PV’s plans to start production of double-layer photovoltaic panels, using cheap and widely available “perovskite” materials originating in the university’s laboratories. Both companies demonstrated unexpected advances in the efficiency of their products at converting light to electricity. Wind turbine costs declined as well, falling to levels not expected for at least another decade in the case of offshore installations in the North Sea. In a particularly good location off the Netherlands, one consortium promised to build a large wind farm for less than €55 (£48) a megawatt hour, less than half the UK government’s target for offshore wind in 2020. According to the investment bank Lazard, onshore wind in the best locations in the US is now two-thirds the cost of the cheapest new gas-fired power stations. And progress wasn’t restricted to wind and solar photovoltaics. We saw the first anaerobic digestion plant added to an African grid, new geothermal heat collectors in the US, France, Kenya and several other countries, and the building of huge plants that collect the sun’s energy as heat, ensuring 24-hour availability of power in countries such as Morocco and Israel. Worldwide, more new renewable electricity capacity was added than all fossil fuels combined in 2015. The usually conservative International Energy Agency said that 60% of new electricity generation over the next five years will come from carbon-free sources. Wind and solar, which are going to become the dominant sources of global energy, cannot provide reliable 24-hour power. But improvements in short-term storage have come at a dazzling rate. For sunny countries, this means solar power combined with batteries will offer cheap and always available electricity. Tesla’s huge Gigafactory opened in Nevada, driving down battery costs further. Large storage systems were installed in hundreds of locations around the world to help electricity grids cope with variable wind and sun. As importantly, rapid advances in digital technology allowed electricity users large and small to respond to shortages of electricity by cutting their own use for short periods. Meanwhile the Chevy Bolt, the world’s first mass-market, 200-mile electric car, reached showrooms in California. World electric car sales grew by more than 50%, achieving more than a quarter of all new registrations in Norway, the world’s most advanced market. Chinese EV manufacturers sold a third of a million vehicles and, very surprisingly, a senior VW executive said that electric cars may be as cheap as petrol vehicles within five years. And they are already much cheaper to run. Even with extensive use of batteries, and continuing improvements in the ability of users to adjust electricity use, northern latitude countries will need more storage to cope with the short winter days and the possibility of weeks without wind. But the German company Electrochaea opened the first full-scale “power to gas” plant in the outskirts of Copenhagen in summer 2016. When electricity is abundant, and therefore very cheap, Electrochaea converts it into natural gas using microbes. This renewable gas can then be burned to generate power when electricity is scarce. In the autumn, Hungary signed an agreement to build an Electrochaea plant 10 times the scale of the Copenhagen trial. This is a technology with extraordinary potential for northern European countries. Other new technologies showed how energy can be stored conveniently for months at a time, usually as liquid fuels similar to petrol or kerosene. Several airlines ordered aviation fuel from the many pioneers making it from sources such as wood chippings or carbon monoxide from steel mills. Much more research is needed on fuels but the outlines of how the world will wean itself off oil are clear. At its simplest, we will use the very cheap electricity produced by wind and solar to chemically convert simple carbon molecules back up to more complex and energy-carrying liquids that can substitute for petrochemicals. As the world set new records for temperature, and the worrying effects of climate change grow more obvious by the week, the encouraging developments of 2016 provide some counterweight. For the first time we can hope that the momentum of low carbon growth is now unstoppable. In many cases around the globe, clean technology no longer needs any subsidy, a finding that seemed unachievable five years ago. Even with sceptical politicians in charge of major democracies, the end of the era of fossil fuels is within view. And this is not just a renewables enthusiast talking; the CEO of Shell said that solar will eventually become the “dominant backbone” of the energy system. The speed of change needs to increase but we can see how it might be possible to run an entirely carbon-free world, including giving abundant energy to people in the poorest countries. I hope this is not an unduly complacent conclusion; we will still need to become far more efficient in our energy use and to push our politicians and business leaders to focus on sustainability. But we no longer have the excuse for inaction that it is too expensive or too difficult to wean ourselves off fossil fuel.

The Land Art Generator Initiative, or Lagi, founded by Pittsburgh-based artists Elizabeth Monoian and Robert Ferry, is trying to find the answer with several proposed public art structures designed to generate power while inspiring and educating their viewers. The initiative has collected hundreds of designs from competitions held in Abu Dhabi, New York City and Copenhagen. At the 2016 competition, which will be held in Santa Monica, California, entrants will design structures that harvest clean energy or generate clean drinking water. “Public art can contribute to the solutions we need to steer us away from the effects of climate change,” Monoian said at October’s SXSW Eco conference in Austin, Texas. One of the initiative’s structures, WindNest, is designed to generate wind and solar energy from four overhead pods that rotate in response to wind currents. The initiative is currently working to install the WindNest in Pittsburgh. If it succeeds, it will be the first of the competition’s designs to be constructed. “It takes a long time for new ideas like this to make their way into the mainstream,” Ferry said. “There are great precedents for ambitious works of public art at the same scale.” Several cities, including Glasgow, have asked Monoian and Ferry to help them install a regenerative public art structure. The two artists are matching three teams that entered Lagi’s past competitions with Glasgow, which will hold a design discussion next month. In the meantime, Ferry said he believes Lagi is changing the way people are thinking about solutions to renewable energy and climate change. “If we are serious about attaining 100% renewable energy infrastructure, then it will have a profound influence on the visual environment of our cities and rural landscapes,” he said. “There is an opportunity to generate site-specific solutions that respond to the needs of the community that lives and works within these new energy landscapes.” Here are some of Lagi’s proposed designs: WindNest A prototype of the WindNest project, designed for Lagi’s 2010 Abu Dhabi competition, was built last fall. If approved, it will be built in Pittsburgh, and visitors will be able to charge their cell phones using wind and solar energy generated from the overhead rotating nests. Estimated annual capacity: 8,000 kWh. Windstalk Inspired by the movement of wind through a wheat field, this proposed installation by New York City-based designers would have 1,200 stalks that are 55m high, arranged in a logarithmic spiral. When it rains, water would run down the stalks and collect at the bottom, feeding a garden of native plants. Wind power would sway the stalks, generating energy and making them light up. Estimated annual capacity: 20,000 MWh. Solar Hourglass This proposed project from a Brazilian designer could power hundreds of homes using concentrated solar power. An array of mirrors would create a beam of solar energy visible to anyone who walks under the structure. Estimated annual capacity: 7,500 MWh. Algaescape Designed to produce biogas from algae, the Algaescape, proposed by a group of German designers, uses a mesh-like material to provide an ideal growing environment for algae biomass. The public would be able to see the algae grow from an open pavilion. Estimated annual capacity: 436 MWh. Light Guard This proposed structure from French designer Vincent Trarieux has 137 metal columns, mounted with LED lights and PV panels. The lights are normally blue, but turn red when sea levels rise high enough to pose a flood risk. Estimated annual capacity: 1,250 MWh. Light Sanctuary Made up of 40km of translucent and flexible photovoltaic ribbons that are attached to masts, Light Sanctuary, a proposed project by New York City-based designers, will absorb light and produce electricity. The 10m-long ribbons self clean when dust and dirt particles are shaken off during movement.

The Treasury is to remove tax reliefs of 30% or more for community energy schemes that reduced the risk for investors and encouraged private capital to help build new energy capacity. The move, which emerged this week during the finance bill’s third reading, had not been expected. It means that investors in community energy projects will not be able to benefit from the so-called Enterprise Investment Schemes, the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme or the Social Investment Tax Relief, making such investments much less attractive. It comes on top of previous subsidy cuts and proposals by the government to cut subsidies for domestic solar installations - so called feed-in tariffs - by 87%. Jan-Willem Bode, the managing director of Mongoose Energy, one of the largest green energy groups in the UK, said: “Many [shareholders] feel like pulling the plug right now because it is just too much negativity thrown at the sector.” Bode said a typical green energy launch project will have 400 to 600 members – “a significant number for a green energy group” – with a minimum investment of £200 in shares. He said Mongoose Energy was aiming for 10,000 investors by March 2016. Cuts to the feed-in tariff would “definitely be a blow to the green image of the government”, said Bode. “But with the latest announcement it has become clear there has been no desire at all to have a vibrant renewable energy sector and especially a community energy sector.” Mongoose Energy, to be chaired next month by Ed Davey, the former energy secretary, with a confirmed pipeline of 100MW of renewable energy, has a £110m portfolio of projects to bring into community ownership such as ground-mounted solar rays in farms, roof-mounted solar panels at schools as well as a hydropower mill. Some of the projects are still under construction or in the process of being funded. A survey earlier this month of 80 community energy groups with membership totalling 11,000 people, revealed 90% of groups said their developing projects were completely or partially at risk due to the proposed cuts. The industry has warned the cuts to subsidies would lead to the loss of 27,000 jobs, with 1,000 jobs already lost as solar firms go out of business. The new research suggests it would also threaten approximately £127m in investment. The report found 38 Community Energy England (CEE) groups had received £7.4m in feed-in tariff subsidies since the scheme began in 2010, which had brought in £50m of private investment and generated £45m for local economies. Projects at risk from the cuts include community solar and hydro projects in Cumbria, which will lead to the county losing at least £750,000 in investment. Barbara Stoll, a Greenpeace energy campaigner, said the subsidies added just £6 a year on people’s bills and solar was moving towards becoming subsidy free. She accused the government of making a “political choice, not an economic necessity”. Emma Bridge, of CEE, said: “Community energy reduces energy bills, provides energy efficiency advice, develops skills, generates revenue in the local economy ... and delivers value for money and this value for money will increase as the sector matures.” She added: “The government’s proposed changes to the feed-in tariffs will seriously damage this vibrant and growing sector, making it far more difficult for communities to take control of the energy they use.” Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, told senior MPs at an energy committee meeting the government remains as committed as ever to meeting emissions reduction targets. Earlier this month she told the parliamentary energy and climate change committee the new government had been forced to implement urgent measures to address an overspend in subsidies to protect bill payers from rising costs. Several solar companies have blamed the planned subsidy cuts for their closure, which has caused more than 1,000 job losses. Leadsom accepted the plans had caused uncertainty. But she said it was a short-term issue and that future announcements about an energy policy “reset” would be aimed at giving investors certainty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}

A senate economics committee inquiry into naval shipbuilding has been running for two years, but a public hearing on Friday was the first since the federal government announced its intention to acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. Independent senator Rex Patrick called the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation to appear. The agencies were quizzed over what nuclear infrastructure and industry would be needed to support the project, and what laws would need to be changed – however, they took most of those questions on notice. Ansto did confirm it was consulted in March about the plan to buy nuclear-powered submarines, about six months ahead of September’s surprise announcement. “Initial conversations started in March and we had a number of consultations between then and the announcement,” chief executive officer Shaun Jenkinson said. Arpansa chief executive officer Carl-Magnus Larsson said his agency was briefed on the plan at the end of June or beginning of July. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said there are no plans to develop a civil nuclear industry to support building submarines. He and defence say the nuclear reactors – which will be procured from the United States or the United Kingdom as part of the Aukus agreement – will not need refuelling, and therefore a domestic industry is not necessary. Ahead of the inquiry, Patrick said: “It’s just unimaginable, it’s beyond comprehension that someone could suggest we’d be operating a nuclear operator in a submarine in a hands-off manner. “I also want to understand what safety regime they understand to be necessary for this to be carried out,” he added. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said having nuclear submarines without an industry to support them would be “more plug and pray” than “plug and play”. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute defence analyst Marcus Hellyer said Australia may not need nuclear power plants or facilities to enrich uranium, “but we’ll still need to perform maintenance and repair on the submarine, including the reactor”. “You can’t have an effective military capability if you need to return it to the US any time there is a defect,” he said. Patrick has pointed out that there are no countries with nuclear submarines that do not have a domestic nuclear industry. “Either way there would be nuclear reactors sitting on hard-stands at Osborne and moored in the Port River,” he said. “Acquiring, operating and maintaining a nuclear submarine fleet without a domestic nuclear power industry is a challenge that must not be underestimated.” Labor senator Kim Carr said there would have to be “extensive onshore facilities” to train people in case there’s an emergency, or a malfunction. “I’d be interested to know how this can be done without the development of the various sustainment industries.” “We’d need to have intensive training of all personnel to understand the linkages between the reactor and all the other bits of the boat,” he said. “You can’t just drop it in. It’s not like a battery in a mobile phone, everything’s connected to everything else.” Australia has a nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney for research and nuclear medicine. Australia also has about a third of the world’s uranium resources, and is working to establish a national radioactive waste management facility. Federal legislation bans the production of nuclear power, as do various state laws. Ansto has said it will work with the US and the UK “to intensively examine the requirements that underpin nuclear stewardship”, and Morrison has said their nuclear science capabilities will be needed. A Defence spokesperson said Australia, through Aukus, had “committed to working … over the next 18 months to determine the optimal pathway to deliver a nuclear-powered submarine capability for Australia”. “Australia will leverage technology, capability and design expertise from the UK and US and will also evaluate a variety of considerations, including but not limited to: submarine design, construction, safety, operation, maintenance, disposal, regulation, training, environmental protection, installations and infrastructure, industrial base capacity, workforce, and force structure,” they said. Shortly after announcing that plans to buy 12 diesel-electric submarines from France would be ditched in favour of the Aukus deal, Morrison was asked to respond to Turnbull’s comments, and those of other nuclear experts, that a supporting industry would be needed. “We may be speaking about different things here and there’s terms that are thrown about here,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/oct/25/putin-dirty-bomb-war-russian-leader-tactics","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-25T16:05:47Z","webTitle":" Putin's wild claims of a dirty bomb show just how badly his army is faring | Hamish de Bretton-Gordon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/25/putin-dirty-bomb-war-russian-leader-tactics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/25/putin-dirty-bomb-war-russian-leader-tactics","fields":{"headline":" Putin’s wild claims of a dirty bomb show just how badly his army is faring","bodyText":"Putin’s conventional army is being defeated by a much smaller force, albeit one backed by the west’s latest technology and intelligence. His ridiculous claim that Ukraine is planning to use a “dirty bomb” – an explosive device containing radioactive material – implies he is now groping towards more unconventional methods of warfare. This is unsurprising when we see how poorly the Russian army is performing, which presumably Putin is also seeing. Putin’s response has been to appoint General “Armageddon” Surovikin as his overall commander in Ukraine, and the dirty bomb allegation is right out of Surovkin’s playbook. The “dirty” bomb concept is a complete chimera – a fantasy designed to terrify people in Ukraine and allow Russia to escalate its unconventional warfare. The claim has been dismissed by France, Britain and the US, and the UN is sending inspectors at Ukraine’s request to two nuclear sites to prove it is baseless . There has never been a successful dirty bomb attack. But their psychological impact is 10 times greater than their physical effect, and Putin must be hoping this will break the will of the Ukrainians. Putin’s style of unconventional warfare relies upon making the civilian population the target rather than the opposing military. And cynically this makes sense, as his own soldiers have been found wanting against the Ukrainian army. The focus is now on attacking civilians as the soldiers fight on the frontlines: killing them on their way to work, or children on their way to school. For those injured in these attacks, the Russians then attack hospitals to prevent treatment: 500 so far in this war, according to the World Health Organisation. Russia tested and developed its unconventional warfare concept in Syria. This included the use of chemical weapons, which the Assad regime turned to whenever defeat seemed imminent. The rebels were about to storm Damascus in August 2013 when Assad dropped the deadly nerve agent sarin on the suburb of Ghouta, killing more than 1,000 people and stopping the advance in its tracks. He also broke the six-year conventional siege of Douma with chlorine barrel bombs in 2018. Weapons like chlorine and dirty bombs are morbidly effective owing to the terror they impart, and must be fully outlawed by the United Nations and the free world. Though I believe that global nuclear warfare is very unlikely, anything less is possible, especially if Putin’s vital territory of Crimea is threatened, which is looking increasingly likely. In unconventional warfare there is very much a “dirty” nuclear threat, which could be almost as devastating as a battlefield nuclear weapon, by turning nuclear power stations into improvised nuclear weapons – in essence a massive “dirty” bomb. In theory the Geneva Conventions and the rules of war outlaw unconventional warfare – but Putin and his generals seem more than willing to ignore both. The new prime minister must, with Nato allies, ensure that Putin is never able to reach for his most devastating unconventional weapons.

The carbon and material footprints of nuclear – for its entire lifetime, including mining and decommissioning – are lower than solar and on a par with wind, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Moreover, the nuclear industry manages its waste stream – that is more than can be said for the solar industry, which is set to produce millions of tons of toxic waste. Besides, spent nuclear fuel is not “waste” but a valuable source of low-carbon energy that can be recycled via reprocessing or proposed breeder reactors, thereby neutralising the vast majority of the radioactivity. At a time when we need every tool in the box to fight the climate crisis – and nuclear is one of the most effective – isn’t it time we started to look at the facts rather than repeat myths about nuclear waste?

Ukraine’s state energy operator has warned there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances” at the Russian-occupied plant. Authorities were distributing iodine tablets to residents who live near the plant in case of radiation exposure. Russia and Ukraine traded fresh accusations of each other shelling the area around the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, on Saturday. Moscow’s troops have “repeatedly shelled” the site of the plant over the past day, the Ukrainian state nuclear company, Energoatom, said. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed Ukraine’s troops “shelled the territory of the station three times” in the past day. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is trying to negotiate access to the plant for an urgent inspection mission “to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there”. Energoatom head Petro Kotin told the Guardian a visit could come before the end of the month, but Ukrainian energy minister Lana Zerkal told a local radio station she was not convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has issued a statement marking Ukraine’s Aviation Day, in which he pledged that Kyiv’s troops would “destroy the occupiers’ potential step by step”. The Ukrainian president vowed that the Russian “invaders will die like dew on the sun”. Russia has probably increased the intensity of its attacks in the Donetsk area of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region over the past five days, according to British intelligence. Pro-Russia separatists have most likely made progress towards the centre of Pisky village, near Donetsk airport, but Russian forces overall have secured few territorial gains, the latest report from the UK Ministry of Defence says. Russia has blocked an agreement at the UN aimed at bolstering the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The failure to agree to a joint statement, due to Moscow’s objection to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia plant, is the latest blow to hopes of maintaining an arms control regime and keeping a lid on a rekindled arms race. Ukrainian sailors will be allowed to leave the country for work, Ukraine’s cabinet of ministers has said. The prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said men of draft age employed as crew members would be allowed to leave the country so long as they had permission from their local conscription offices to cross the border. Britain’s defence ministry has said it is giving six underwater drones to Ukraine to help clear its coastline of mines and make grain shipments safer. In addition, dozens of Ukrainian navy personnel will be taught to use the drones over the coming months, the ministry said. Kazakhstan, a neighbour and ally of Russia, has suspended all arms exports for a year, its government said, amid the conflict in Ukraine and western sanctions against Moscow. Poland and the Czech Republic have agreed to protect the airspace of their Nato ally Slovakia, as it upgrades its air force from legacy Soviet-made MiG-29 fighters to a new batch of F-16 jets from the US. The EU is set to suspend its visa travel agreement with Russia this week, The Financial Times reports. The plan to freeze a 2007 deal will make it harder and more expensive for Russians to get Schengen-area documents, the FT reports. It comes after some eastern member states threatened to unilaterally close their borders to Russian tourists, with other countries calling for collective action to stop ordinary Russians from travelling to the EU on tourist visas. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has previously called for a complete ban. Russia claims it has hit workshops at the Motor Sich factory in the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine. The facility is where helicopters for the Ukrainian air force are being repaired, the defence ministry said. But Ukrainian officials later said the hit resulted significant civilian damages, damaging nine multi-storey buildings and 40 private homes. A Russian missile has struck military infrastructure in Rivne oblast in northern Ukraine. Reports so far are that there were no casualties, and that the missiles came from just over the border from Belarus. The United States called out Russia’s “cynical obstructionism” after Moscow remained the sole holdout in blocking the adoption of a joint declaration on nuclear non-proliferation following lengthy negotiations at the United Nations. The 191 signatories review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty every five years, which aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and promote cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. But on Friday, Russia prevented the declaration’s adoption, saying it took issue with “political” aspects of the text. It is unclear whether Russia will try to boost its armed forces by recruiting more volunteer “contract” soldiers or by lifting annual targets for conscriptions, British intelligence says. President Vladimir Putin signed a decree this week to increase the size of the armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million in the wake of the country’s invasion of Ukraine, now in its sixth month. The latest UK Ministry of Defence briefing says that under the Russian legislation now in place, the decree is unlikely to make “substantive progress” towards increasing Russia’s combat power. Two people were killed when Russia fired on Bakhmut, the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Saturday. The eastern city is a significant target for Russian and separatist forces seeking to take control of the parts of Donetsk they don’t hold. Associated Press also reported local government officials as saying that in the Black Sea region of Mykolaiv, one person was killed and another wounded in Russian firing. On the opposite shore from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the towns of Nikopol and Marhanets were hit by shells on Saturday afternoon and evening, Nikopol’s mayor, Yevhen Yevtushenko, said on Telegram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/ninety-per-cent-of-houses-are-damaged-thousands-trapped-in-ukraines-small-towns","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T15:08:54Z","webTitle":"‘90% of houses are damaged’: Russia’s Syria-honed tactics lay waste Ukraine towns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/ninety-per-cent-of-houses-are-damaged-thousands-trapped-in-ukraines-small-towns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/ninety-per-cent-of-houses-are-damaged-thousands-trapped-in-ukraines-small-towns","fields":{"headline":"‘90% of houses are damaged’: Russia’s Syria-honed tactics lay waste Ukraine towns","bodyText":"Happiness lies in ruins. This small town – Schastia in Ukrainian – has been out of the headlines since Moscow took its brutal war against civilians to the country’s biggest cities. But it is here, and in nearby Volnovakha, that the illegal tactics of terrorising civilians for military aims, honed in Syria and then brought back so close to home, have reached a grim high point. There have been terrible strikes on homes, schools and hospitals around Ukraine. But residents of both towns say the barrage of shelling, rocket assaults and airstrikes since the start of the war has damaged or destroyed nearly every building in their towns, a comprehensive devastation as yet unmatched elsewhere. The Russian flag has now been raised over the ruins of Schastia. In Volnovakha, the attack is still so intense that dead bodies lie uncollected, says local MP Dmytro Lubinets. Ukrainians still brave enough to run rescue missions are going back only for the living. Thousands of them are trapped in basements, with dwindling supplies of food and water, sheltering from an apparently senseless attack on a town Lubinets says has no military defenders in its centre. The line of contact is 20km away, he says. “It never stops, every five minutes there is a mortar landing or artillery shells, some buildings have been hit by multiple rocket systems,” he said by phone. “In the city there is not any building which has not suffered from direct or collateral damage. So some buildings have major destruction, some minor destruction, some are completely destroyed to the ground.” On Friday morning, Ukrainian media claimed that a Russian war plane bombing “residential areas and civilian infrastructure” in the area was shot down. Pavlo*, a Schastia native who evacuated his family, said 80% of the town was damaged in an intense bombardment that lasted days, and as in Volnovakha, barely any buildings were entirely untouched. “People started evacuation after three days, when Russian forces stopped bombing the town and people could leave the shelters,” he said. “People didn’t have water, gas, electricity for three or four days because of the bombing. They used all kinds of their weapons, Grad rockets, artillery and mines.” The devastation in larger cities such as Chernihiv and Kharkiv is deadly and terrible, but has still affected only a relatively small portion of the towns, even if the terror it instils casts a shadow over every civilian still trapped there. But what Russian forces appear to show in these smaller towns is that they are willing to leave behind them a wasteland on a massive scale, as they did in Grozny in Chechnya, or – together with Syrian forces – in the ancient city of Aleppo. Neither humanity nor heritage stopped them. Attacking civilians, and the infrastructure that supports life including hospitals and schools, is illegal under international law. It has no direct strategic advantage for an advancing army. But it is extremely effective at breaking morale of a resisting population. The “I love Volnovakha” sign in the centre of town, which has survived somehow, has a backdrop of ruined houses. It appears at the start of a video, filmed from a moving car, which captures crumpled shops, buildings blackened by fire, and a road strewn with debris. Before the war, the population of the town was 25,000. Lubinets says at least 3,000 people are trapped, but possibly many more. Hundreds of them are children. Requests for a humanitarian evacuation corridor have gone unanswered, so the military and other volunteers are risking their lives to bring people out in small groups. “We drive under fire to the places where people mostly concentrated, schools, hospitals, grab them out, put them in the car and bring them out, because the shelling never stops at any second,” he said. “Its impossible to use buses because they have low mobility. Always when you go there you will get punctures, so you just have to drive [the car] out for about 10 minutes to places where big buses can come.” For many residents of these towns, their lives are as irreparably shattered as their homes, barely a week into this war. Their suffering may be a terrible template for the damage Russia will inflict on others, if Moscow tries to pound bigger towns and cities into submission. “There was life before, and life after, and now I just feel emptiness inside,” said Iyrna*, who fled in a long, lonely journey through a succession of towns and cities under attack – first Chernihiv, then Kyiv and finally to relative safety in the western city of Lviv. “Nobody knows what is going on there.” “A friend [still in Schastia] told me: ‘I can’t even go to your place to try and collect some papers, or other things, everything there is totally smashed up,’” she said. “Ninety per cent of houses are damaged.” She was just out of hospital after major surgery when the war began, and her husband is serving on the frontline. “For three days I was in such deep stress I couldn’t eat or drink, even now they have been swept out of my memory. I was so exhausted I had hallucinations that my husband was with me.” Shastia and Volnovakha were on the frontline for eight years of the smaller-scale war between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatists, and Lubinets believes the carnage inflicted on the towns now is revenge for their resilience through those years. “From the very first day of the war they started shelling us directly … They are trying to wipe out the town,” he said. “I think someone in Russia is destroying [the town] as a reminder of what they can do to someone who doesn’t break in the face of Russian aggression.” * Name has been changed to protect family members in areas under Russian control"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-437-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-06T02:24:01Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 437 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-437-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-437-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 437 of the invasion","bodyText":"A prominent Russian nationalist writer, Zakhar Prilepin, was wounded in a car bombing in the region of Nizhny Novgorod on Saturday, the Russian state news agency Tass said, in an attack that Russia immediately blamed on Ukraine and the West. Tass quoted a source in the emergency services as saying the writer’s car was blown up. “He survived, but was wounded and is conscious,” the source was quoted as saying. Russia has been accused of attacking the besieged city of Bakhmut with incendiary phosphorus weapons, BBC News reported. Ukraine’s military shared drone footage of what appeared to show Bakhmut ablaze as white phosphorus rains down on the city. Ukraine’s air force has claimed to have downed a Russian hypersonic missile over Kyiv using newly acquired American Patriot defence systems, the first known time the country has been able to intercept one of Moscow’s most modern missiles. Air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk said in a Telegram post that the Kinzhal-type ballistic missile had been intercepted in an overnight attack on the Ukrainian capital earlier in the week. It was also the first time Ukraine is known to have used the Patriot defence systems. Concerns in the Russian leadership about its vulnerability to attacks and the potential for public protests over the Ukraine war have contributed to the decision to cancel many Victory Day parades, citing security concerns, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its latest intelligence briefing, the ministry said six Russian regions, occupied Crimea and 21 cities had cancelled their parades on Tuesday marking the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. Russia is still not satisfied with how the issue of Russian agricultural exports as part of the Black Sea grain deal is being resolved, TASS news agency quoted deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin as saying on Saturday after the latest talks with a top UN official. “We are still not satisfied with the progress. This is very important for us,” Vershinin said. He was speaking after talks in Moscow with the United Nations’ top trade official Rebeca Grynspan, TASS said. Poland will demand European Union sanctions on imports of Russian farm products, its ambassador to the EU Andrzej Sadoś was quoted as saying by PAP news agency. “Europe isn’t threatened by disruptions in supply chain of farm products now, contrary, we have a problem of surpluses. We are resolving a problem of increased imports of farm products from Ukraine,” Sadoś said, according to PAP. Switzerland’s parliament has approved a request from Ukrainian authorities for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address it. The invitation, announced in a statement late on Friday, comes amid pressure on Switzerland’s government to break with a centuries-old tradition of neutrality and end a ban of exports of Swiss weapons to conflict zones such as Ukraine. Kherson’s weekend curfew is the latest inconvenience for residents who, after enduring months of Russian occupation last year, have been subjected to daily bombardments by Russian troops encamped nearby on the other side of the River Dnipro. Despite their retreat from Kherson city last November, Russian forces still hold large swathes of territory in the wider Kherson region that Ukraine wants to recapture, Reuters reports. Some residents left Kherson in cars and buses on Friday while others stocked up on groceries before a 56-hour curfew began on Friday evening in the southern Ukrainian city. Reuters reports that the announcement of the curfew, lasting until Monday morning, prompted speculation in Kherson that the city was about to be used as a launch point for Ukraine’s much-anticipated counterattack. Strikes on Russian infrastructure including drone attacks on refineries and train sabotage have multiplied in recent weeks, with experts suggesting they are part of Ukraine’s preparations for an expected spring offensive. Agence France-Presse reports that Kyiv has not claimed any of the acts denounced by Moscow as Ukrainian “sabotage” of “unprecedented momentum”, but the majority appear to target Russian army supply chains in border regions and in annexed Crimea, a base for Russian troops. Ukraine has sent first lady, Olena Zelenska, and Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, as the country’s representatives to UK’s King Charles’s coronation in London on Saturday. Zelenska posted on her official Facebook: “It is an honour for us and prime minister Denys Shmyhal to attend the coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla The royal family here at Westminster Abbey to wish on behalf of all of Ukraine successful governance and prosperity to the country.” The leader of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force has said his forces will leave Bakhmut, which they have been trying to capture since last summer. Yevgeny Prigozhin said they would pull back on Wednesday 10 May – ending their involvement in the war’s longest battle – because of heavy losses and inadequate ammunition supplies, and he asked defence chiefs to put regular army troops in their place. But Ukraine said Wagner fighters were reinforcing positions to try to seize the eastern city before that date. Prigozhin earlier released a video showing him standing in a field of Russian corpses and blaming defence chiefs for the losses suffered by his fighters in Ukraine, appearing to reignite his simmering feud with Russian top brass. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has carried out an inspection of troop readiness for forces engaged in the war, in an apparent coded response to Prigozhin’s criticism. Ukraine said two people had been killed and nine wounded in the eastern Donetsk region and electricity distribution networks had been damaged by shelling in the Donetsk and Kherson regions. Authorities in the Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia have begun evacuating villages near the frontline. The Russian-installed governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, announced the move in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive aimed at retaking the area, claiming Kyiv’s forces had “stepped up shelling of settlements close to the frontline” in the past few days. Engineers have reduced the risk of a dam bursting and damaging the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a senior Russian official was quoted by state news agency Tass as saying on Friday. Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the general director of energy engineering firm Rosenergoatom, said specialists had begun discharging water from the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam on the Dnieper River in southern Ukraine. A Moscow court has ordered the arrest of a theatre director and a playwright on charges of “justifying terrorism” over an award-winning play about Russian women recruited online to marry radical Islamists in Syria. Director Yevgeniya Berkovich and author Svetlana Petriychuk were placed in custody until 4 July, Russian news agencies reported. Bill Clinton has said he knew in 2011 it was just “a matter of time” before the Russian president attacked Ukraine. “Vladimir Putin told me in 2011 – three years before he took Crimea – that he did not agree with the agreement I made with Boris Yeltsin,” the former US president recalled. “He said … ‘I don’t agree with it.

In Germany, key questions over the country’s energy future hang on the question of whether artificial intelligence systems can do a better job of spotting the reclusive animal than birdwatchers do. Lesser spotted eagles (named after the drop-shaped spots on their feathers) are fond of riding thermals over many of the flatlands earmarked for a mass expansion of onshore windfarms by a German government under pressure to compensate for a pending loss of nuclear power, coal plants and Russian gas. Because lesser spotted eagles in mid-flight are unused to vertical obstacles, and keep their eyes focused on mice, lizard or frog-shaped prey below, conservationists say, they are known to occasionally collide with the rotor blades of wind turbines. German researchers list eight dead specimens found in the vicinity of windfarms since 2002, a small but not insignificant number given the species’ endangered status in the country. A controversial reform of the federal nature conservation act, pushed through by Olaf Scholz’s coalition government earlier this summer, slashes red tape around building windfarms near nesting sites, but banks on AI-driven “anti-collision systems” as one way to minimise such accidents. Software engineers in Colorado are feeding hundreds of thousands of images of the airborne clanga pomarina into an algorithm. Linked to a camera system perched atop a 10-metre tower, the trained-up neural networks of the US company IdentiFlight are expected to detect eagles approaching from a distance of up to 750 metres and electronically alert the turbine. The turbine will then take 20-40 seconds to wind down into “trundle mode” of no more than two rotations each minute, ideally giving the eagle plenty of time to navigate safe passage between its slowly moving blades. IdentiFlight spent three years testing its anti-collision systems at six supervised sites across Germany, and says its neural network boasts rates of more than 90% for recognising and classifying red kites, the first birds of prey it has been trained in for German territories. While fog, rain or snow can reduce the system’s effectiveness, the makers say, low visibility also decreases the eagles’ appetite for airborne hunting raids. The system is expected to be certified for spotting sea eagles in the coming weeks, with validation for their lesser spotted relatives scheduled for 2023. “From our point of view, the system could be a good solution,” said Moritz Stubbe, a business manager trying to bring anti-collision systems to German wind parks. “We are waiting for the green light.” The technological solution is also meant to solve a political conundrum for the Green party, the second-largest party in the three-way coalition government and driving force behind the new nature protection law. By keeping the peace between those of its supporters who define ecological politics predominantly as safeguarding biodiversity and those who prioritise mitigating the climate crisis. Wind energy in Germany underwent a massive boom after Angela Merkel announced the phase-out of nuclear power in 2011, with windfarms currently providing about a quarter of the country’s electricity needs. But the expansion plans have stalled for the past four years, at about 30,000 turbines providing just over 60,000 megawatt hours a year. Wind power companies complain that planning applications take longer and longer, with not only environmentalists but locals opposed to turbines having learned to use natural protection laws to stymie their plans. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine upended decades of German energy policy, Scholz’s government had announced its intention to reverse the trend: it has plans to increase electricity from renewables by 80% over the next eight years, and to commit Germany’s 16 federal states to provide 2% of their landmass for wind energy over the next ten. Experts say this would amount to an additional 16,000 turbines by 2030, or 38 a week. To reach these targets, Germany’s Green-run environmental ministry has for the first time drawn up a conclusive list of 15 birds it deems at risk of colliding with turbines. Those animals that did not make the list, such as the black stork, cannot be cited to stop a planning application. But even those that did make the grade are now protected to a lesser degree. Windfarms can in the future be built outside a 1.5km radius around the nest of the lesser spotted eagle, for example, down from 3km. In the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, conservation officers said this is likely to affect 10 nesting pairs. Wind park developers may still be obliged to take additional measures to protect the at-risk birds, such as by switching off turbines while fields in the vicinity are being harvested, thus attracting birds of prey on the lookout for newly exposed field mice. Switching off turbines for an entire breeding season, however, will no longer be allowed, and rotor blades are not allowed to be kept at standstill if the farm’s energy production is diminished by 4-8% as a result, depending on the location. “It’s a catastrophe”, said one nature protection officer who did not want to be named, suggesting the legislation was likely to be disputed and thus bog down planning applications rather than unleash turbine builders. Some lawyers argue the new act violates European environmental law; the German Wind Energy Association (BWE) vehemently disagrees. Court action looks predestined. “As a society, we have to start asking ourselves some basic questions,” said Wolfram Axthelm, BWE’s chief executive. “Do we want to build windfarms because we want to mitigate climate change and protect the environment as a whole? Or do we want to save every individual bird?” The number of birds killed by wind turbines, he said, was dwarfed by those that perished after flying into windows, being run over by cars or being caught by domestic cats. “We have to concentrate on the population as a whole.” Clanga pomarina is named after Pomerania, the historical region on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea. In Germany, the lesser spotted eagle’s population has declined by a quarter since the 1990s, not mainly due to wind turbines, but to a gradual disappearance of the woodland-meets-wetland habitats where the birds like to nest. Further to the east, in Estonia, Lithuania and Slovakia, the species is still thriving. The International Union for Conservation of Nature red list of threatened species lists the lesser spotted eagle’s global population as stable, with an estimated 40,000-60,000 mature individuals remaining in the wild."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/11/ukraine-russia-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-has-shut-down-says-operator-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-12T01:13:25Z","webTitle":"‘You can’t scare us’, Zelenkiy tells Russia, after missile attacks on Kharkiv – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/11/ukraine-russia-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-has-shut-down-says-operator-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/11/ukraine-russia-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-has-shut-down-says-operator-live","fields":{"headline":"‘You can’t scare us’, Zelenkiy tells Russia, after missile attacks on Kharkiv – as it happened","bodyText":"This blog is closing now but you can catch up with the latest on the attacks on the Ukrainian gains in Kharkiv and the Russian response here: And you can follow all our Ukraine coverage here. The general commanding Russia’s western army group has been sacked in the wake of the retreat in the Kharkiv region, according to Ukrainian military intelligence. It reported on its Telegram channel that Gen Roman Berdnikov has been replaced after only 17 days in his post, the GUR said. It said: “The leadership of the western grouping of the RF Armed Forces has been removed from command. The reason for this decision is the crushing defeats received as a result of the offensive of the Ukrainian Defense Forces. His replacement is Lt-Gen Alexander Lapin, commmander of army group centre, who will now take charge of both, according to the Ukrainians. There was no confirmation of the claim from other sources. It should also be noted that in June, Ukrainian sources said Berdnikov had been killed in action. However, Russia’s defence ministry said on Telegram that its forces in the Kharkiv region had “inflicted defeat on” Ukrainian units in Pristin, Boldyrevka, Sinikha, Beloe, Komarovka, Gorokhovatka, Kupyansk, Senkovo and Podvysokoye of the Kharkov region. “More than 250 Ukrainian servicemen, 12 armored vehicles, three field artillery pieces, one multiple rocket launcher and 17 vehicles were destroyed,” it said. If you want a quick catchup on what’s been going on, check out our latest at a glance guide on day 201 of the war. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has delivered a fierce response to Russian attacks on the Kharkiv region. In a nightly message on Telegram, the Ukrainian president said that although the Kremlin was trying to deprive his people of “gas, light, water and food”, it would not succeed in defeating them. “Do you still think that you can scare us, break us, make us make concessions?” he asks in a stirring that is worth posting in full: Even through the impenetrable darkness, Ukraine and the civilized world clearly see these terrorist acts. Deliberate and cynical missile strikes on civilian critical infrastructure. No military facilities. Kharkiv and Donetsk regions were cut off. In Zaporizhia, Dnipropetrovsk, and Sumy there are partial problems with power supply. Do you still think that we are “one people”? Do you still think that you can scare us, break us, make us make concessions? You really did not understand anything? Don’t understand who we are? What are we for? What are we talking about? Lip reading: Without gas or without you? without you Without light or without you? without you Without water or without you? without you Without food or without you? without you Cold, hunger, darkness and thirst are not as scary and deadly for us as your “friendship and brotherhood”. But history will put everything in its place. And we will be with gas, light, water and food.. and WITHOUT you! Hello, good morning/afternoon/evening wherever you are in the world. I’m Martin Farrer taking over our rolling coverage of the war in Ukraine from Maya Yang. The big story of the moment is Russian missile attacks on civilian infrastructure such as power stations and water facilities in the Kharkiv region after Ukrainian forces scored a series of notable battlefield victories in the area over the weekend. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has denounced the strikes. “Russia’s apparent response to Ukraine liberating cities and villages in the east: sending missiles to attempt to destroy critical civilian infrastructure,” Brink tweeted. Moscow denies its forces deliberately target civilians. It’s just past 2am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: “We will call it victory,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video address on Sunday, referring to a potential Russian retreat. He added that he is confident that Ukrainian forces will liberate all Russian-occupied territories across the country. Russian forces have launched a total of 11 missiles towards the eastern regions of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Air Force announced in a tweet on Sunday night. The Ukrainian Air Forces shot down seven cruise missiles in the Dnipropetrovsk region and two more missiles were destroyed in the Poltava region, the UAF said. Due to shelling of the infrastructure, a number of trains from/to Kharkiv, Sumy and Poltava are expected to be delayed. However, not a single train today was cancelled; traffic continues on the entire railway network. Two cruise missiles hit critical infrastructure in Kharkiv and firefighters were on the scene, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration. Tymoshenko said engineers are working to restore power and electricity should soon be back in vital facilities such as hospitals. “We will call it victory,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video address on Sunday, referring to a potential Russian retreat. “They will call [the Russian retreat] a gesture of goodwill … we will call it victory,” the president said, adding that he is confident that Ukrainian forces will liberate all Russian-occupied territories across the country. “The world is amazed by our warriors, the enemy is in a panic,” he said. Our reporters Lorenzo Tondo and Isobel Koshiw are bringing us the latest from the frontlines of Kharkiv, where Russian attacks on Sunday night damaged infrastructure facilities and power supplies across the region. Their reporting follows: Russia targeted infrastructure facilities in central and eastern Ukraine on Sunday evening in a response to a dramatic Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv province that has reshaped the war and left Moscow reeling. The mayor of Kharkiv city, Ihor Terekhov, said a strike had knocked out power and water to much of the city, in what he described as an act of “revenge” by Russia for Ukraine’s recent battlefield successes. There were reports of blackouts in Dnipro, Poltava and other eastern cities, potentially affecting millions of civilians. Volodymyr Zelenskiy blamed “Russian terrorists” for the blackouts. “No military facilities [were attacked],” the Ukrainian president said in a statement on social media. “The goal is to deprive people of light and heat.” In an early-evening update on the military situation, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukrainian forces, said Ukrainian soldiers had regained control of about 3,000 sq km of territory since the start of September, and were approaching the border in the country’s north-east. To find out more, read their latest story: Russian forces have launched a total of 11 missiles towards the eastern regions of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Air Force announced in a tweet on Sunday night. The Ukrainian Air Forces shot down seven cruise missiles in the Dnipropetrovsk region and two more missiles were destroyed in the Poltava region, the UAF said. Images have emerged of the fiery aftermath of the destruction of a critical infrastructure object in Kharkiv area. Due to shelling of the infrastructure, a number of trains from/to Kharkiv, Sumy, and Poltava are expected to be delayed. However, not a single train today was canceled; traffic continues on the entire railway network. At the stations in Kharkiv and other temporarily cut-off cities, safe disembarkation and boarding of passengers has been organized. Passengers will also be allowed to stay on the territory of the stations during the curfew. Two cruise missiles hit critical infrastructure in Kharkiv and firefighters are now on the scene, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration. Tymoshenko said engineers are working to restore power and electricity should soon be back in vital facilities such as hospitals. Power was cut to areas Russia was attempting to capture in the early weeks of the invasion. Tymoshenko confirmed that Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk and part of the Donetsk region were suffering from blackouts. Tymoshenko said power had been 100% restored in Sumy region, which neighbours Kharkiv, and that power in the Poltova region is back. “Russians want to leave us without light, water and heat.” It’s nearly 10pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: A counteroffensive is occurring in the Kharkiv region, according to the Ukrainian defense ministry. “Prepare to swim, occupiers,” the ministry said in a tweet on Sunday. Meanwhile, Russian forces have been disrupting power supply in Kharkiv, Dnipro and Poltava, the Wall Street Journal reports. A nationalist militant and former FSB officer who helped launch a 2014 war in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region compared the collapse of one of the conflict’s principal front lines to a catastrophic defeat in the Russo-Japanese war which triggered Russia’s 1905 Revolution. Igor Girkin said it was like the 1905 Battle of Mukden, which ended took place two days after the revolution started. Russian president Vladimir Putin has warned his French counterpart of “catastrophic consequences” of apparent Ukrainian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Putin “drew attention to regular Ukrainian attacks on [the Zaporizhzhia nuclear] facilities, including a radioactive waste storage facility, which is fraught with catastrophic consequences”, according to the Kremlin, as reported by AFP. Moscow’s leadership has remained “silent” on the defeats in Ukraine, with neither Putin or the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, making any comment as of midday on Sunday. Moscow’s almost total silence on the defeat – or any explanation for what has taken place in north-eastern Ukraine – has provoked significant anger among some pro-war commentators and Russian nationalists on social media. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-appointed leader of Chechnya, has criticised the Russian army’s leadership after it appeared to be caught off-guard by Ukraine’s fightback against the Russian invasion in the north-east. In a sign that the Kremlin may face serious fallout over the loss of territory that the Russian occupation administrations had repeatedly stated they planned to keep “for ever”, Kadyrov also suggested that Vladimir Putin might not be aware of the real state of affairs. “Nobody knows” where Russian rockets will land in Ukraine after the invasion by the larger neighbor, president Voldymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview with CNN broadcast on Sunday. Talking in broken English to CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, Zelenskiy said of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, “you cannot be afraid of him” as a way of explaining why he was doing the interview while walking on the grounds of the Ukrainian presidential palace in Kyiv. Zakaria noted that previous interviews with him had been held in a bunker or similar setting. Zelenskiy noted that, morning and night, however, Russian bombs can land anywhere. Guardian’s defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh has written this analysis on how Ukraine has exploited thin Russian cover with its sweeping counter offensive, and how more gains are possible In five days, Ukraine’s northern counter-offensive has changed everything. What began as a push in a part of the front largely ignored by military analysts became an advance of 43.5 miles (70km), capturing “more territory than Russian forces have captured in all their operations since April”, according to the Institute of the Study of War. Before Wednesday, Ukraine had struggled to make much progress with offensive operations. Yet, south-east of Kharkiv, Kyiv has shown it can dynamically exploit military circumstances in its favour – opening up the prospect of further, dramatic gains before winter settles in. Russia had diverted thousands of its best combat troops to defending the southern city of Kherson, in response to a Ukrainian offensive that it said it had begun a couple of weeks ago. Exhausted by months of continuous war, the Kremlin left the sector south-east of Kharkiv lightly defended. Read more: Ukraine’s defence ministry has shared this tweet, after the 130th battalion made it to Hoptivka near the Russian border. Yaroslav Trofimov of the Wall Street Journal has said that Russian forces are disrupting the power supply to eastern Ukraine, affecting the power supply to Kharkiv, Dnipro and Poltava. Reports have suggested that Kharkiv is without power completely. A nationalist militant and former FSB officer who helped launch a 2014 war in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, compared the collapse of one of the conflict’s principal front lines to a catastrophic defeat in the Russo-Japanese war which triggered Russia’s 1905 Revolution. Igor Girkin said it was like the 1905 Battle of Mukden, which ended took place two days after the revolution started. Ukraine has hailed its rapid advance, which saw thousands of Russian soldiers flee, leaving behind ammunition stockpiles and equipment, as a turning point in the 6-month-old war. Girkin, who has been unsparing in his criticisms of the country’s top brass, dubbing defence minister Shoigu “the cardboard marshal”, has said repeatedly that Russia will be defeated in Ukraine if it doesn’t declare a nationwide mobilisation, Reuters reports. Nationalist anger at military failure is potentially a far greater problem for the Kremlin than pro-Western liberal criticism of Putin: opinion polls continue to show broad support for what Moscow calls the “special military operation”. As the capital celebrated Moscow Day with street parties and concerts on Saturday, rumblings of disquiet even spread to Russia’s ordinarily subservient parliament. Sergei Mironov, leader of the nominally opposition but Putin-loyal Just Russia party, said on Twitter that a firework display in honour of the holiday should be cancelled, in view of the military situation. One message reposted on Telegram by the prominent war correspondent Semyon Pegov referred to the celebrations in Moscow as “blasphemous” and the refusal of Russian authorities to embark on full-scale war as “schizophrenic”. “Either Russia will become itself through the birth of a new political elite ... or it will cease to exist,” it read. More on that telephone conversation between Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin (see 16:54), as the Kremlin readout has now been published. The Russian president warned his French counterpart of “catastrophic consequences” of apparent Ukrainian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. During the call, Putin “drew attention to regular Ukrainian attacks on [the Zaporizhzhia nuclear] facilities, including a radioactive waste storage facility, which is fraught with catastrophic consequences”, according to the Kremlin, as reported by AFP. The largest nuclear power plant in Europe has been a focal point of fighting in recent weeks, raising concerns of a potential nuclear incident. Ukraine’s nuclear energy operator said on Sunday the final reactor at Zaporizhzhia had been shut off as a safety measure. During the call with Macron, Putin also accused Ukrainian forces of using western-supplied weapons to target civilian infrastructure in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine. More on the discussion (see 15:22) between the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Macron told Putin that its occupation by Russian troops was the root cause of danger at the site. The Élysée Palace said in a statement that Macron asked Putin to withdraw heavy and light weapons, and that Moscow should abide by the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure security. “The president will remain in contact with President [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy as well as the director general of the IAEA and will speak again in the coming days with President Putin so that an accord to guarantee security at the power plant can be found,” the statement said. Macron also asked Putin to ensure that a UN-brokered deal on grains was implemented to ensure they went to the most in need. He also repeated that the Russian invasion should stop immediately. Moscow’s leadership has remained “silent” on the defeats in Ukraine, with neither Vladmir Putin or the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, making any comment as of midday on Sunday. As Russian forces abandoned town after town on Saturday, Putin was opening Europe’s largest ferris wheel in a Moscow park, while fireworks lit up the sky over Red Square to celebrate the city’s founding in 1147. Moscow’s almost total silence on the defeat – or any explanation for what has taken place in north-eastern Ukraine – has provoked significant anger among some pro-war commentators and Russian nationalists on social media. However, according to a Kremlin transcript of Putin’s message there was no mention of the war. The Russian president told Muscovites: “We take pride in Moscow, and love this city with its majestic antiquity and its modern and dynamic pace of life, the charm of its cosy parks, lanes and streets and abundance of business and cultural events.” Putin, who has described his shock on being told as a KGB spy in East Germany that “Moscow is silent” as the Berlin Wall crumbled, said those who had fallen in the Ukraine operation had given their lives for Russia. The defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-appointed leader of Chechnya, has criticised the Russian army’s leadership after it appeared to be caught off-guard by Ukraine’s fightback against the Russian invasion in the north-east. In a sign that the Kremlin may face serious fallout over the loss of territory that the Russian occupation administrations had repeatedly stated they planned to keep “for ever”, Kadyrov also suggested that Vladimir Putin might not be aware of the real state of affairs. “They have made mistakes and I think they will draw the necessary conclusions,” Kadyrov said in an audio message posted to his Telegram channel on Sunday. “If today or tomorrow no changes in strategy are made, I will be forced to speak with the leadership of the defence ministry and the leadership of the country to explain the real situation on the ground to them. It’s a very interesting situation. It’s astounding, I would say,” said Kadyrov, a former rebel turned Kremlin ally who rules Chechnya – a Russian republic in the Caucuses – with an iron fist and has a paramilitary force at his command. Read more: Here is a round-up of all the day’s main news stories: Ukrainian forces have advanced north from Kharkiv to within 30 miles (48km) of the border with Russia and are also pressing to the south and east in the same region, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said on Sunday. Ukrainian troops have retaken more than 3,000 sq km of territory this month, he wrote on the Telegram messaging app, adding: “Ukraine continues to liberate territories occupied by Russia. The Ukrainian advance into Russian-occupied territory in the north-east of the country continued on Sunday as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the next three months would be critical in determining the outcome of the war. In recent days, Ukrainian forces have retaken the key rail hub of Kupiansk and claim to have seized Izium, previously the major base for Russia in Kharkiv province. Zelenskiy has said Ukraine’s armed forces have retaken about 2,000 sq km (770 sq miles) of territory from Russian forces since their surprise north-eastern counteroffensive was launched earlier this month. In his Saturday night address, the Ukrainian president said: “These days, the Russian army is showing its best – showing its back. And, in the end, it is a good choice for them to run away. There is and will be no place for the occupiers in Ukraine.” The last operating reactor at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station has been shut down and the plant “completely stopped”, Ukraine’s nuclear power operator has said. The six-reactor Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from the grid last week after all its power lines were disconnected as a result of fighting in the area, and was operating in “island mode” for several days, generating electricity for crucial cooling systems from its only remaining reactor in operation. A backup power line to Zaporizhzhia has been restored, providing it with the external electricity it needs to cool its reactors, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Sunday. “After yesterday’s restoration of [the] power line ... #ZNPP operator this morning shut down its last operating reactor, which over past week had been providing ZNPP w/ required power after it was disconnected from grid,” the IAEA said on Twitter. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, discussed the security situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, the Kremlin said. Speaking by phone, the two leaders expressed readiness for a “non-politicised interaction” on the matter with the participation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), according to the statement published on the Kremlin’s website. France’s transport minister has said he will sign an agreement with Romania to increase Ukrainian grain exports to developing countries including to the Mediterranean. “Tomorrow, I will sign an accord with Romania that will allow Ukraine to get even more grains out ... towards Europe and developing countries, notably in the Mediterranean, which need it for food,” Clement Beaune told France Inter radio on Sunday, adding that the deal covered exports by land, sea and river. The UK government has said Ukrainian forces have continued to make significant gains in the Kharkiv region over the last 24 hours. Russia has probably withdrawn units from the area, but fighting continues around the cities of Kupiansk and Izium, the British defence ministry said in its daily intelligence bulletin on Twitter. Britain also dismissed Vladimir Putin’s assertion that only a fraction of grain exported from Ukraine under an international deal is going to poor countries. Putin said on Wednesday, without citing a source, that only two of 87 ships, carrying 60,000 tonnes of products, had gone to poor countries. The deal to allow grain exports from Ukrainian Black Sea ports, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, took effect last month. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Harry Taylor will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest news from Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, discussed the security situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, the Kremlin said. Speaking by phone, the two leaders expressed readiness for a “non-politicised interaction” on the matter with the participation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), according to the statement published on the Kremlin’s website. Reuters has some more detail on the news that France is to sign an agreement with Romania (see 13.03) to increase Ukrainian grain exports to developing countries, including in the Mediterranean. “Tomorrow, I will sign an accord with Romania that will allow Ukraine to get even more grains out ... towards Europe and developing countries, notably in the Mediterranean, which need it for food,” the French transport minister, Clément Beaune, told France Inter radio on Sunday, adding that the deal covered exports by land, sea and river. Reuters reports: According to a draft agreement of the French-Romanian deal, seen by Reuters, Paris would cooperate in developing a project aimed at increasing efficiency at the port of Galați, equipping border points in northern Romania. It would also help to build a medium-term strategy on the axes of the corridor between Romania and Ukraine, and provide pilings to optimise ship traffic. France will also provide funding for the initial technical expertise and work with Bucharest to identify financing for the future. Without citing a source, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on 7 September that only two of 87 ships, carrying 60,000 tonnes of exported grain products as part of an international deal brokered by the United Nations, had gone to poor countries. The accord to allow grain exports from Ukrainian Black Sea ports took effect in August. Beaune dismissed Putin’s assertion. Quoting UN figures, the British defence ministry also rejected the claim and said that about 30% of grain exported under the deal has been supplied to low- and middle-income countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Alisa, a 16-year-old art student from Kharkiv, arrived in Hungary in April with her family after fleeing their apartment in the suburb of Saltivka, which came under heavy shelling for weeks on end. After two days in a Budapest hotel, the family found an elderly Hungarian couple living in the countryside nearby who agreed to host Alisa, her brother and parents. The couple said their Ukrainian guests could stay as long as they needed. But recently, as the Hungarian government announced massive increases in energy bills for households that use above the national average, the couple made an embarrassed request. “Back then, they said we could stay until the end of the war, but now they’ve realised they can’t afford the energy bills. They very politely told us we had to leave,” said Alisa, who spent the summer working long shifts in a Hungarian factory, even though she is still a minor. “It took me two buses and four hours to get there, and the same to get back every day. The work was tiring, taking apart old electronics for hours on end. But at least I got some money which I could help my family with,” she said. In the six months since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the countries that border Ukraine, as well as others all across Europe, have launched an unprecedented effort to help millions of Ukrainian refugees. Governments have funded emergency support programmes, and millions of ordinary citizens have volunteered to provide food, clothing and shelter. But as an uncertain and potentially costly winter approaches, governments are rolling back support programmes for Ukrainians, while many volunteers who were happy to host a Ukrainian family for a few weeks or months are now realising that the war could go on for years. More and more Ukrainian refugees are finding themselves struggling to make ends meet. The Ukrainian advance into Russian-occupied territory in the north-east of the country continued on Sunday as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the next three months would be critical in determining the outcome of the war. In recent days, Ukrainian forces have retaken the key rail hub of Kupiansk and claim to have seized Izium, previously the major base for Russia in Kharkiv province. “The Russian army in these days is demonstrating the best that it can do – showing its back,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address on Saturday. Gen Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukrainian forces, said on Sunday that Ukraine had regained control of about 3,000 sq km of territory since the beginning of September. On Saturday night, Zelenskiy gave the figure as 2,000 sq km. The Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine has retaken more territory in five days than Russia had taken since April. Videos from recently recaptured territory illustrate the scale of the rout, showing military hardware and ammunition left behind by fleeing Russians at their former positions. Ukrainian politicians shared morale-boosting videos of the country’s soldiers raising the national flag in various towns and villages. The counteroffensive in the north-east of the country came as a surprise to Moscow and most military observers, who had been expecting instead the long-promised Ukrainian advance in the southern Kherson region. France’s transport minister has said he will sign an agreement with Romania to increase Ukrainian grain exports to developing countries including to the Mediterranean. “Tomorrow, I will sign an accord with Romania that will allow Ukraine to get even more grains out ... towards Europe and developing countries, notably in the Mediterranean, which need it for food,” Clement Beaune told France Inter radio on Sunday, adding that the deal covered exports by land, sea and river. A backup power line to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) inside Ukraine has been restored, providing it with the external electricity it needs to cool its reactors, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Sunday. “After yesterday’s restoration of [the] power line ... #ZNPP operator this morning shut down its last operating reactor, which over past week had been providing ZNPP w/ required power after it was disconnected from grid,” the IAEA said on Twitter. “This power can now come from the grid instead.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine has recaptured 770 sq miles of territory so far this month in a series of offensives. “The movement of our soldiers in different directions of the front continues,” the Ukrainian president said in an address late on Saturday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine’s armed forces have retaken about 2,000 sq km (770 sq miles) of territory from Russian forces since their surprise north-eastern counteroffensive was launched earlier this month. In his Saturday night address, the Ukrainian president said: “These days, the Russian army is showing its best – showing its back. And, in the end, it is a good choice for them to run away. There is and will be no place for the occupiers in Ukraine.” Zelenskiy spoke after the Russian army was forced to pull back thousands of troops following a series of crucial battlefield defeats in the north-east, as the invasion ordered by Vladimir Putin entered its 200th day. Ukrainian forces confirmed the liberation of the crucial rail hub of Kupiansk and shortly after seized Izium, the major base for Moscow’s forces in the Kharkiv region, in what was perhaps Ukraine’s most significant success in pushing back the Russians since the beginning of the invasion. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said in Kyiv that Ukrainian forces had demonstrated they were capable of defeating the Russian army with the weapons given to them. “And so I reiterate: the more weapons we receive, the faster we will win, and the faster this war will end,” he said. Ukrainian troops had also liberated the villages of Vasylenkovo and Artemivka in the Kharkiv region, Zelenskiy said. The last operating reactor at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station has been shut down and the plant “completely stopped”, Ukraine’s nuclear power operator has said. The six-reactor Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from the grid last week after all its power lines were disconnected as a result of fighting in the area, and was operating in “island mode” for several days, generating electricity for crucial cooling systems from its only remaining reactor in operation. Energoatom, the state-run operator of all four of Ukraine’s nuclear power stations, said one of the power lines was restored on Saturday night, allowing plant operators to shut down the last reactor. “A decision was made to shut down power unit No 6 and transfer it to the safest state – cold shutdown,” the operator said. Electricity supply to the plant has been cut with increasing frequency over the past few weeks, including at least three times last week. Volunteers at a railway station in Lviv in western Ukraine are doing all they can to help refugees flee the violence of Putin’s invasion and reach safety. Lviv is less than 50 miles from the Polish border and thousands of people have been arriving daily from the rest of country. The Guardian spent the day with one volunteer named Sergyi Mykolaiv. Ukrainian forces have advanced north from Kharkiv to within 30 miles (48km) of the border with Russia and are also pressing to the south and east in the same region, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said on Sunday. Ukrainian troops have retaken more than 3,000 sq km of territory this month, he wrote on the Telegram messaging app, adding: “Ukraine continues to liberate territories occupied by Russia.” Reuters was not immediately able to verify his account. In case you missed it, the much-publicised Ukrainian southern offensive was a disinformation campaign to distract Russia from the real one being prepared in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine’s special forces have said. Ukrainian forces are continuing to make unexpected, rapid advances in the north-east of the country, retaking more than a third of the occupied Kharkiv region in three days. Much of Ukraine’s territorial gains were confirmed by Russia’s defence ministry on Saturday. “[It] was a big special disinformation operation,” said Taras Berezovets, a former national security adviser turned press officer for the Bohun brigade of Ukraine’s special forces. “[Russia] thought it would be in the south and moved their equipment. Then, instead of the south, the offensive happened where they least expected, and this caused them to panic and flee.” On 29 August, Ukraine’s southern command announced that the long-anticipated offensive in the Kherson region had begun. But soldiers on the Kherson frontline said at the time that they saw no evidence of said offensive, or that the active battles taking place were a reaction to an attempted Russian offensive several days earlier. Over the past two weeks, Ukrainian forces in the south have taken several villages – no small feat given the reported strength of Russian positions. The Associated Press has a piece today about Ukraine’s success in reclaiming broad swathes of the south and east in a long-anticipated counter-offensive that has dealt a heavy blow to Russia. The counter-attack began in the final days of August and at first focused on the southern region of Kherson, which was swept by Russian forces in the opening days of the invasion, it reports. But, just as Moscow redirected attention and troops there, Ukraine launched another, highly effective offensive in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv. AP reported: Facing the prospect of a large group of its forces becoming surrounded, Moscow ordered a troop pullback from Kharkiv, in a dramatic change of the state of play that posed the biggest challenge to the Kremlin since it launched the invasion on February 24. Mykola Sunhurovskyi, a military expert with the Razumkov Centre, a Kyiv-based think tank, said: “The Ukrainian army has taken advantage of the relocation of the bulk of the Russian forces to the south and is trying to direct the course of the war, excelling in manoeuvre and showing great ingenuity.” Ukraine’s quick gains, he added, are “important both for seizing initiative and raising troops’ spirit”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commended the military in a video address late on Saturday, saying it has reclaimed more than 770 square miles (2,000 sq km) of territory so far this month. He also taunted Moscow over its withdrawal, saying the Russian army is “demonstrating the best it can do - showing its back” and “they made a good choice to run”. Both sides have suffered heavy losses in Europe’s largest conflict since the Second World War. Since the counter-offensive began, Ukraine said, its forces have reclaimed more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region. Britain has dismissed Vladimir Putin’s assertion that only a fraction of grain exported from Ukraine under an international deal is going to poor countries. Putin said on Wednesday, without citing a source, that only two of 87 ships, carrying 60,000 tonnes of products, had gone to poor countries. The deal to allow grain exports from Ukrainian Black Sea ports, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, took effect last month. Quoting UN figures, the British defence ministry said about 30% of grain exported under the deal has been supplied to low- and middle-income countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, Reuters reported. Russia is pursuing a deliberate misinformation strategy as it seeks to deflect blame for food insecurity issues, discredit Ukraine and minimise opposition to its invasion, the ministry said in its daily intelligence bulletin on Twitter. The UK government has said Ukrainian forces have continued to make significant gains in the Kharkiv region over the last 24 hours. Russia has probably withdrawn units from the area, but fighting continues around the cities of Kupiansk and Izium, the British defence ministry said in its daily intelligence bulletin on Twitter. Aside from the latest news at the Zaporizhzhia plant, here are the main developments: Ukraine’s counter-offensive in the north-east of the country has inflicted an extraordinary defeat on Moscow, prompting the Russian army to pull back thousands of troops after a series of battlefield defeats. Ukraine appears to have regained control of the two key cities of Kupiansk and Izium after a major counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region in recent days, after wrongfooting Russian forces with a much-publicised Ukrainian southern offensive to distract Russia from the real one being prepared in Kharkiv. Photos published by the Ukrainian security forces showed troops raising the national flag in Kupiansk, an important logistical hub for Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, where rail lines linking Russia to eastern Ukraine converge and which, in the last months, has supplied Russian forces in north-eastern Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry confirmed the withdrawal of its troops from Izium, the major base for Moscow’s forces in Kharkiv, claiming they were being “regrouped” so that efforts could be stepped up in Donetsk. Retaking Izium is perhaps Ukraine’s most significant success in pushing back the Russians since the beginning of the invasion. The Ukrainian flag has also been raised in the city of Balakliia, according to the Kharkiv regional governor. The UK Ministry of Defence said Russian forces were “likely taken by surprise” by the counteroffensive. The much-publicised Ukrainian southern offensive was a disinformation campaign to distract Russia from the real one being prepared in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine’s special forces said. “[Russia] thought it would be in the south and moved their equipment. Then, instead of the south, the offensive happened where they least expected, and this caused them to panic and flee,” said Taras Berezovets, a former national security adviser turned press officer for the Bohun brigade of Ukraine’s special forces. In a video address on Saturday, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukrainian forces had liberated about 2,000 sq km (700 square miles) of territory since the counteroffensive against Russia started earlier this month, saying: “The Russian army these days is demonstrating its best ability – to show its back.” Residents in Russian-controlled parts of the Kharkiv region have been advised to evacuate to Russia, according to the state-run news agency Tass. A woman has been killed and at least 20 civilians injured in Russian shelling in the Kharkiv district, according to the regional governor. A resident of Izium, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed to the Guardian that Ukrainian troops had entered the city. Before that, “Russian occupying forces were rapidly withdrawing, leaving ammunition and equipment behind.” The UN said it has documented “torture and ill-treatment” of prisoners of war held by Russian forces in Ukraine. It also said it had corroborated at least 5,767 civilian deaths, though added that the actual numbers are “likely considerably higher”. The Ukrainian military said a further 350 Russian soldiers had been killed, bringing the total number since the start of the invasion to 52,250. The military also said Russia was also sending 1,300 Chechen fighters to the southern Kherson region. It comes as western intelligence suggests that Russian forces in Kherson are coming under sustained pressure from Ukrainian attacks. Despite the gains made by Ukraine’s armed forces, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the war was entering a critical period and he urged Ukraine’s western backers to keep up their support through what could be a difficult winter. Today’s shutdown follows the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog chief saying on Friday that recent shelling made the “situation increasingly precarious” as reliable supply was unlikely to be restored. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said vital offsite electricity supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant had been destroyed by shelling and there was little likelihood a reliable supply would be re-established. He said shelling had destroyed the switchyard of a nearby thermal power plant. The plant has supplied power to the nuclear facility each time its normal supply lines had been cut over the past three weeks. The sixth reactor had been operating in “island mode” for the past three days, it said, feeding only its own needs after power lines were severed by Russian shelling. The restoration of one of these lines on Saturday enabled the operator to make the decision to place the site in “the safest state – cold shutdown”. If lines continue to be damaged, the plant will rely on backup diesel generators, “the duration of which is limited by the technological resource and the amount of available diesel fuel”, Energoatom said. In a statement posted on Telegram, Energoatom said the sixth and last functioning reactor was disconnected from the national grid at 3.41am and that “preparations are under way for its cooling and transfer to a cold state”. Operations at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine have fully halted, Energoatom, the state agency in charge of the plant, said on Sunday. The agency said the restoration of power to the plant had allowed it to do the safest thing and power down its sixth and last working reactor. Kyiv on Wednesday called for residents of Russian-occupied areas around the plant, Europe’s largest, to evacuate for their own safety. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling the nuclear plant, risking a nuclear disaster."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/oct/11/power-giants-to-face-windfall-tax-after-all-as-liz-truss-delivers-u-turn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-11T21:30:14Z","webTitle":"Power giants to face ‘windfall tax’ after all as Liz Truss delivers U-turn ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/11/power-giants-to-face-windfall-tax-after-all-as-liz-truss-delivers-u-turn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/oct/11/power-giants-to-face-windfall-tax-after-all-as-liz-truss-delivers-u-turn","fields":{"headline":"Power giants to face ‘windfall tax’ after all as Liz Truss delivers U-turn ","bodyText":"Renewable power companies will have their revenues capped in England and Wales, after the government bowed to pressure to clamp down on runaway profits. The announcement late on Tuesday night provoked immediate accusations that Downing Street had performed “another screeching U-turn” – having previously rejected calls to impose a windfall tax on power giants. On the leadership trail, Liz Truss repeatedly resisted calls to cap huge profits being generated by power companies, after Boris Johnson’s government imposed a £5bn windfall tax on oil and gas companies in May, taking a slice of their profits. The business department said it was stepping in with a temporary “cost-plus revenue limit” for renewable and nuclear electricity generators in England and Wales. This will curb the amount generators can make, “allowing generators to cover their costs, plus receive an appropriate revenue”, and will come into force at the start of next year. The detail was contained in the government’s new energy prices bill, which limits power prices for households at an average of £2,500 a year and is estimated will cost taxpayers about £89bn. It has been estimated that taxing generators such as wind and solar farms could raise between £3bn and £4bn to help offset some of this cost. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate and net zero secretary, said: “The government has finally accepted the principle of Labour’s call for a windfall tax on excess profits of electricity generators. “After months of telling the country they were utterly opposed to the principle of a windfall tax, they have been dragged kicking and screaming to implement it. “Yet again this shows Labour leading the agenda in British politics with another screeching U-turn from a government in office but not in power. But the government’s delay in acting will have cost billions and the public will pay the price.” Truss ruled out a windfall tax on power generators when vying with Rishi Sunak to become prime minister, calling it “a Labour idea and all about bashing business and it sends the wrong message to international investors and to the public”. She reinforced her stance when announcing her household bills package last month, saying: “I believe it is the wrong thing to be putting companies off investing in the UK.” But after reversing plans to scrap the top rate of tax last week, Truss’s decision to limit profits at renewable power companies will be seen as another sign of weakness. The government has been accused by institutions including the IMF of making the Bank of England’s cutting-inflation job harder. Mortgage rates soared, along with government borrowing costs, after chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous mini-budget last month. An industry source said: “This is another U-turn as it’s 100% a windfall tax from the people that said they would never do one.” The business department argues that the measure differs from a windfall tax as it will be applied to excess revenues generators are receiving, rather than applying to all profits. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said renewable power generators have been benefiting from “abnormally high prices” because of the link between soaring gas prices and wholesale electricity prices, since Russia’s winvasion of Ukraine. “Low-carbon electricity generators are therefore benefiting from abnormally high prices, while consumers are having to pay significantly more for energy generated from renewables and nuclear, even though they often cost less to produce,” it said. The government said the limit would be a “temporary measure to deal with the exceptional market conditions driven by high global gas prices”. The decision to impose a cap on revenues earned by renewable power companies such as wind and solar farm operators follows months of painful wrangling between the government and industry. Ministers tried to encourage companies to voluntarily move on to contracts for difference (CfDs), that cap profits above a certain level, but without much success. BEIS said the revenue cap would remain in place until the markets returned to normal or generators moved on to other market arrangements, such as CfDs. “It will ensure consumers pay a fair price for low-carbon energy and has the potential to save billions of pounds for British bill payers, while allowing generators to cover their costs, plus receive an appropriate revenue,” BEIS said. Nevertheless, generators reacted with dismay. Keith Anderson, chief executive of ScottishPower, said: “We’re deeply worried at the suggestion renewables generators are making extraordinary profits when our power has been sold in advance at much lower pre-war prices – a fraction of today’s cost – protecting customers by hundreds of millions of pounds. “It’s disappointing that such a significant market intervention by the government has come with so little detail, all this does is create uncertainty. This crisis has been caused by the cost of gas and it’s strange the proposed solution is to cap the price of low-carbon generation and to leave the gas sector untouched.” A spokesperson for SSE said: “Any revenue cap must be set at a level that doesn’t discourage essential investment in the UK’s renewable energy sector and therefore should be comparable to other countries, particularly given the €180 [per megawatt hour] cap being implemented by the EU. After all, the key lesson of the current energy crisis is the need to bolster our homegrown energy defences. “It is also vital that the cap does not negatively impact on security of supply this winter, therefore flexible technologies, such as hydro, that require strong price signals to meet demand when most needed should be excluded.” The announcement was light on details, but the government said it had been working closely with industry on the proposal, and would launch a consultation shortly. BEIS is liaising with the Scottish government to confirm whether the measure will extend to Scotland. The legislation also allows for a temporary revenue limit to apply in Northern Ireland. In determining the limit, BEIS said it was taking into account the pre-crisis expectations for wholesale prices, and what a reasonable upper estimate for those might be. It intends to allow generators to keep a proportion of their revenue above the limit. Britain has a diverse energy generation sector, including companies supplying power from gas- and coal-fired power plants, windfarms and nuclear power stations. Centrica, ScottishPower and some others serve consumers directly, but many are focused on delivering power to retail suppliers. The biggest generators include SSE, E.ON, Ørsted and Drax, which runs a large eponymous power plant in North Yorkshire. Nevertheless, the announcement implied Drax and nuclear power plants and other so-called baseload power providers would be given special treatment under the scheme, given “the importance of continued investment in these supplies”. In May, the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced what he called a “temporary, targeted energy profits levy” of 25% on oil and gas firms, but with a 90% tax relief for companies that invest in oil and gas extraction in the UK. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the business and energy secretary, said: “We have been working with low-carbon generators to find a solution that will ensure consumers are not paying significantly more for electricity generated from renewables and nuclear.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/10/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-168-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-10T14:17:15Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 168 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/10/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-168-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/10/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-168-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 168 of the invasion","bodyText":"Without claiming explicit responsibility for an attack on a Russian airfield in Crimea on Tuesday, Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said on Wednesday that it had destroyed nine Russian planes within the last 24 hours. It did not specify the locations. The claim follows widely reported explosions at Russia’s Saki air base. Crimea’s regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said some 250 residents were moved to temporary housing after dozens of apartment buildings were damaged, but Russian authorities have generally sought to downplay the explosions. Unverified social media footage purports to show damage to planes on the ground at the airport. Crimea’s regional ministry of health has said that one person died and 13 people were injured as a result of explosions at the air base near Novofedorivka. The Russian military have said that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area at the facility. Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014. In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not discuss who was behind the attacks but vowed to “liberate” Crimea, saying: “This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea – with its liberation.” An adviser to the president, Mikhail Podolyak, said Ukraine was not taking responsibility for the explosions, suggesting partisans might have been involved. Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are reorienting the plant’s electricity production to connect to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, according to Ukrainian operator Energoatom. “To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system. From August 7 to 9, the Russians have already damaged three power lines. At the moment, the plant is operating with only one production line, which is an extremely dangerous way of working,” Energoatom president Petro Kotin told Ukrainian television. The plant, located not far from the Crimean peninsula, has six of Ukraine’s 15 reactors, and is capable of supplying power for four million homes. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power firm warned of the “very high” risks from shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-occupied south and said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in time for winter. Energoatom’s chief, Petro Kotin, told Reuters in an interview that last week’s Russian shelling had damaged three lines that connect the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Ukrainian grid and that Russia wanted to connect the facility to its grid. Russia’s daily military briefing for Wednesday has claimed to have shot down three Ukrainian planes overnight, and to have destroyed German-supplied anti-aircraft systems. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has said that in the last 24 hours two people have been killed and 25 civilians were injured in the territory it claims to control. At least 13 people have been killed overnight by shelling in Marhanets in Dnipropetrovsk. Regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said more than 20 buildings were damaged. Ukraine’s emergency service has distributed images which appear to show a school in Marhanets damaged by an attack. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, said that as a result of shelling at around 1.40am Wednesday morning, three people, including a 13 year-old girl, were injured in the city of Mykolaiv. He said residential buildings were damaged as a result of shelling. The leaders of Estonia and Finland want fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take holidays in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine. The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, wrote on Tuesday on Twitter that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right” and that it was “time to end tourism from Russia now”, the Associated Press reported. Denmark will send military instructors to Britain to train Ukrainian soldiers and also aims to train Ukrainian officers in Denmark, the Danish defence minister said in an interview with the Jyllands-Posten newspaper published Wednesday. The US state department has approved $89m worth of assistance to help Ukraine equip and train 100 teams to clear landmines and unexploded ordnance for a year, Reuters reported. US president Joe Biden on Tuesday signed documents endorsing Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato, the most significant expansion of the military alliance since the 1990s as it responds to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. The total number of grain-carrying ships to leave Ukrainian ports under a UN brokered deal to ease the global food crisis has now reached 12, with the two latest ships which left on Tuesday headed for Istanbul and Turkey. Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad has been struggling with quotas imposed by the EU for sanctioned goods that it can import across Lithuania from mainland Russia or Belarus, the region’s governor admitted. Lithuania infuriated Moscow in June by banning the land transit of goods such as concrete and steel to Kaliningrad after EU sanctions on them came into force, Reuters reported. Russia has launched an Iranian satellite from Kazakhstan amid concerns it could be used for battlefield surveillance in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Iran has denied that the Khayyam satellite, which was delivered into orbit onboard a Soyuz rocket launched from Baikonur cosmodrome, would ever be under Russian control. But the Washington Post previously reported that Moscow told Tehran it “plans to use the satellite for several months, or longer, to enhance its surveillance of military targets” in Ukraine, according to two US officials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/apr/02/mikhail-shishkin-my-russia-war-or-peace-interview-letter","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-02T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"Mikhail Shishkin: ‘The main enemy of Russian culture is the Russian regime’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/02/mikhail-shishkin-my-russia-war-or-peace-interview-letter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/apr/02/mikhail-shishkin-my-russia-war-or-peace-interview-letter","fields":{"headline":"Mikhail Shishkin: ‘The main enemy of Russian culture is the Russian regime’","bodyText":"Mikhail Shishkin was born in Moscow and is one of the most lauded writers in contemporary Russian literature, and the only one to receive all three of Russia’s most prestigious literary awards. An outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin and what he calls his “criminal regime”, he has lived in exile in Switzerland since 1995. In My Russia: War Or Peace?, his most recent book to be translated into English, he surveys the violent contours of Russia history and examines the troubled relationship between the Russian state and its citizens. You’ve spoken in the past of a civil war in Russian literature between nationalists and liberals. Has that deepened since the invasion of Ukraine? Twenty years ago we were all together in Kyiv at the literary festival – writers and poets writing in Russian in Ukraine. And I had the feeling that finally we are building the future Russian culture, where mutual understanding is important. And then later the Crimea annexation came and I saw people I’d been sitting at the table with shouting: “Crimea is ours! Crimea is ours!” It was like the famous play by [Eugène] Ionesco, Rhinoceros, where people turn into rhinoceroses. It wasn’t possible to talk to them. It was impossible to talk to my brother who lives in Moscow. So we became strangers. There is something like a civilisation gap between us in Russian culture. I can understand why people who don’t read books support this war. But it’s impossible for me to explain why cultured people support this war. In your book you say it’s the mission of all Russian writers and artists to show that not all Russians support this war. But as you say, many artists and writers don’t think that’s their mission. It’s a mission for me now. All my life I felt very solid ground under my feet. It was Russian culture. And now it’s blown away. One hundred years ago Russian immigrants were not ashamed of speaking Russian on the streets of Berlin or Paris. But now they are ashamed to speak their language. And my mission now is to do everything to return dignity to the Russian language. And that is possible only with the victory of Ukraine in this war against our common enemy, the Russian regime, because the main enemy of Russian culture is the Russian regime. You write that Russia will have a future only if it passes through total defeat. Is that a viable option for a nuclear power? Putin has the psychology of all dictators: “If I leave this world, the world must go with me.” They don’t have empathy. They don’t love people. They hate people. And so I’m sure he would press the red button. But nobody will fulfil his order to destroy the Earth. Nobody. And you know why? Because in Russia the main question is not like in Russian classical literature of 19th century: who is to blame? What is to be done? No, the main question is: is the tsar real or false? And you can prove that you are real by winning a war. Stalin killed millions of people but he is beloved by the population. Gorbachev was beloved in the west, but he lost the Afghanistan war and the cold war against the west. [So] he’s despised. Putin’s generals told him they would take Kyiv in three days, and he miscalculated. He failed. And now he is a false tsar. Nobody will fulfil an order from a false tsar. Your book is a warning against the corruption of language, the normalisation of the lie. But if a lie carries more power than the truth, who will be brave enough to challenge it, and risk imprisonment or death? When was the last time, for example, you were in Russia? Last time I was in Russia was in October 2014. At the Krasnoyarsk book fair. I was the only one who was talking from the stage about the war. This silence was so humiliating, it was my last visit to Russia. Now it’s impossible to go anyway. I get death threats, but what should I do? Should I keep silent? Should I stop talking or writing? Then my life doesn’t make any sense any more. I will not give up. You write about the “wild 90s” in Russia when oligarchs stole natural resources and criminals were empowered. It was the great missed opportunity. What could the west have done to support Russian democracy? I’m afraid the truth is that the west helped to introduce this criminal regime to Russian people. In the 90s people were ready for democracy but they had no idea how it works. What did western democracies show to the new Russian democracy? I worked as an interpreter in Switzerland and I saw how this huge laundry machine works. People with the stolen money, the dirty money came from Russia to open an account in Zurich. And lawyers, people from the banks, everybody was so happy to get this dirty money. They were absolutely aware that this was dirty money. The same thing happened in London, even worse I think. It’s of course the main responsibility of the Russians but without this support from western democracies, it would have been impossible to create this new dictatorship in Russia. Do you view the future of Russia with any sense of optimism? I am very optimistic for Ukraine. I’m sure they will have victory in this war. And I’m very pessimistic for the Russian future. I don’t think it will be a democratic, wonderful, beautiful country. One day Putin will not be here, and then we will see a huge fight for power. The collapse of the Russian empire will continue; all these national republics will leave the Russian Federation. Siberia will go. I think we will have new dictators and the west will support them because they will promise to take control of nuclear weapons, and Russian history will bite its tail again. You say in the book that hate is the disease, and culture is the cure. Can culture have a role in changing that bleak future? After this war, there will be such huge hate between Ukrainians and Russians. It will be not easy to make bridges. But we’ll have to make bridges.

It follows reports of an expected announcement from the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that researchers have managed to get more energy out of a nuclear fusion reaction than they put in. The coalition, led by the Australian laser fusion company HB11 Energy, also includes the University of Adelaide, the Institute of Laser Engineering at Osaka University, the Japanese laser fusion firm EX-Fusion, and the French engineering multinational Thales Group. It aims to develop an ultra-high intensity laser facility in Australia, with petawatt (one quadrillion, or one million billion watts) lasers. Dr Warren McKenzie, founder and managing director of HB11 Energy, said Australia was one of few developed countries without such a facility, adding that high-powered lasers could be used for energy generation through nuclear fusion. “The same lasers can be used, for instance, for the transmutation of fission radioactive waste – essentially reducing the half-life of radioactive waste from hundreds or thousands of years to tens of years,” he said. McKenzie also described the reported US fusion result as arguably “one of the biggest developments in energy science this century”. National Ignition Facility researchers have reportedly produced more energy from a nuclear fusion reaction than what was put in – a milestone known as net energy gain. In a development yet to be confirmed by the NIF, scientists are reported to have shot high-power lasers at a fuel pellet of deuterium and tritium – both isotopes of hydrogen – inside a metal capsule. “Lasers both heat the fuel … but they also compress it to much higher than its natural density, and the combination of the increase in density from the compression and the heat is what triggers fusion,” McKenzie said. Prof Ken Baldwin of the Australian National University described the NIF’s apparent advancement as “a truly groundbreaking achievement”, but said it was unlikely fusion power would “save us from climate change”. “All the heavy lifting for the energy transition will be done by renewable energy and nuclear fission (existing nuclear power) – with nuclear fusion at commercial scale unlikely to be available until later this century, well after the 2050 deadline needed to keep global warming below two degrees. But beyond that, fusion might provide limitless energy for centuries to come,” Baldwin said in a statement. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Mark Diesendorf, an associate professor and deputy director of the Institute of Environmental Studies at the University of New South Wales, agreed that fusion was “decades away from any possibility of commercial electricity generation”. “There’s a huge gap between this experiment – which I really would hesitate to call a breakthrough – and what has to be done to get commercial electricity out,” he said. “There’s an intense pulse of laser radiation for a tiny fraction of a second. Then the question is: during that tiny fraction of second, did they get more fusion energy out than they put in?” Diesendorf said. “To generate electricity, what you’ve got to do is to have thousands and thousands … perhaps millions of these pulses a day successfully getting more energy out. And then you’ve got to capture that energy.” Diesendorf also warned of the risk of nuclear proliferation, pointing out that the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the fusion breakthrough was made, is a nuclear weapons research facility. “Fusion produces neutrons and neutrons can be used to transmute elements – so you can get nuclear explosives such as plutonium-239 and uranium-233 and uranium-235,” Diesendorf said. “You can also produce lots of tritium … an essential component of nuclear bombs in missiles.” McKenzie said HB11 was the first modern private fusion company to demonstrate fusion involving lasers, and that unlike the NIF, it was not using tritium as fuel, but boron. “When we produce fusion, it doesn’t create any radiation or radioactive waste,” he said. HB11 is still “four orders of magnitude” away from achieving net energy gain. McKenzie said the firm was able to generate 0.01% of the energy input in its fusion reactions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/12/national-grid-coal-fired-plants-uk-icy-weather-electricity-blackouts-snow","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-12T11:44:12Z","webTitle":"National Grid stands down coal plants on standby in icy weather","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/12/national-grid-coal-fired-plants-uk-icy-weather-electricity-blackouts-snow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/12/national-grid-coal-fired-plants-uk-icy-weather-electricity-blackouts-snow","fields":{"headline":"National Grid stands down coal plants on standby in icy weather","bodyText":"Great Britain’s electricity system operator has stood down two coal-fired power stations that were put on emergency standby to keep the lights on amid a spell of cold weather. Earlier on Monday, National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) said the two “winter contingency coal units” would be available if required as temperatures dip below zero and demand soars. It said the public should continue to use energy as normal. But the units will not now be needed, with Great Britain’s energy needs met by other sources, including an anticipated pickup in wind power. The government this summer asked the owners of coal-fired power stations to slow closure plans as ministers looked to shore up energy supplies after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia was previously a big supplier of natural gas to Europe, so the invasion roiled global energy markets and prompted a scramble for alternatives. The coal plants in North Yorkshire that were preparing to operate on Monday are owned by the energy company Drax. They would only operate if instructed to do so by National Grid, and Drax would not have been able to sell the electricity on the open market. A Drax spokesperson said: “National Grid ESO instructed the units to be warmed earlier today so that they were ready to generate power should the country require it. That instruction has since been stood down.” It comes as snowfall and ice caused travel disruption and forced school closures across the UK. The drop in temperatures prompted UK power prices to hit a record high on Sunday. Great Britain’s electricity generation system has rapidly moved away from coal in recent years: its first coal-free day was achieved in 2017, while in 2020 the island ran without coal-powered electricity for a month during a sunny May. The use of zero-carbon renewables has increased rapidly to replace it, but the UK has also increased its reliance on natural gas, a fossil fuel. That reliance has proved problematic during 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine. Great Britain was heavily dependent on burning gas for electricity generation over the weekend, with low winds and cloudy skies. On Saturday, gas generated 62% of electricity in Great Britain, according to National Grid data. Nuclear power stations generated 14%, while wind and solar accounted for 8% and 1% respectively. Coal accounted for 4%. (Northern Ireland’s energy system operates separately.) National Grid ESO sought to emphasise that asking the coal-fired power stations to heat up did not mean it had any concern over blackouts on Monday. “This measure should give the public confidence in Monday’s energy supply,” National Grid ESO said. “The ESO as a prudent system operator has these tools for additional contingency to operate the network as normal and the public should continue to use energy as normal.” EDF, the French energy giant, said the nuclear fleet in the UK was running at full available capacity for the first time this winter after the return of Hartlepool Unit 1 from a planned refuelling outage. EDF operates the fleet, in which the British Gas owner, Centrica, is a minority investor. National Grid warned in October that severe conditions could trigger planned power cuts this winter. Fintan Slye, the executive director of the ESO, said that was still a possibility. But he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We remain cautiously optimistic through the winter that we will be able to manage it. We have enough supplies secured through the rest of the day that we can manage that and ensure there’s no disruption to customers’ supplies.” National Grid will run a test of its “demand flexibility scheme”, which encourages households to reduce their energy use during peak times, on Monday evening. Octopus Energy said its customers had been paid £1m for reducing their energy usage during the company’s first four “saving sessions” as part of the scheme. Customers saved on average more than £4 across the four sessions, with the top 5% of savers bringing in almost £20."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/09/walk-away-traditional-owners-defend-kakadu-against-a-new-push-from-uranium-miners","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-08T19:00:37Z","webTitle":"‘Walk away’: traditional owners defend Kakadu against a new push from uranium miners ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/09/walk-away-traditional-owners-defend-kakadu-against-a-new-push-from-uranium-miners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/09/walk-away-traditional-owners-defend-kakadu-against-a-new-push-from-uranium-miners","fields":{"headline":"‘Walk away’: traditional owners defend Kakadu against a new push from uranium miners ","bodyText":"The battle to protect Kakadu national park from uranium mining has reignited with a push to overturn an 18-year-old promise to First Nations people in order to access billions of dollars of radioactive ore. It is the resurrection of a decades-old campaign to mine Jabiluka, a proposal that was abandoned after a hard-fought campaign by the Mirarr people – traditional owners – and environmentalists. But the debate is also throwing the rehabilitation of Ranger, an open-cut uranium mine adjacent to Jabiluka imposed on the Mirarr in the 1970s, into doubt. Rio Tinto owns 86% of the mine operator, Energy Resources of Australia, and has agreed to spend the billions needed to restore the land at Ranger to the same quality as the surrounding park. Rio has also pledged not to mine Jabiluka as long as the traditional owners are against it. The Mirarr say they will never change their minds. They want to put mining in the past and instead build an economy out of the township of Jabiru that is based on tourism to Kakadu. The world heritage site on Australia’s northern tip is not only brimming with natural beauty, it also carries immense cultural and spiritual significance as the site of the oldest known site of human habitation in Australia. With the deposits at Ranger tapped out and just two years to go on the mining lease at Jabiluka, the fate of the mines seemed sealed. But minority shareholders in ERA reckon Jabiluka’s rich deposit should be mined to provide fuel for the transition to a low-carbon economy and that it’s also worth having another look at a second deposit deep underneath the Ranger site. Their cause was given a boost last week with the release of a valuation report, commissioned by members of the ERA board who aren’t affiliated with Rio, that suggested Jabiluka is worth more than $1bn. It provoked a furious response from the Mirarr, who have called for the Albanese government to intervene; and from Rio, which called on ERA’s chair to resign. The furore has thrown into doubt ERA’s ability to raise the $2.2bn needed to fulfil its promise to restore Ranger. This week, all the independent directors of ERA resigned. Rio agreed to give the company some breathing space by lending it up to $100m towards rehabilitation of Ranger. However, the fundamental dispute has yet to be resolved. ‘The white man is not likely to stop’ Right from the beginning, the Mirarr people opposed mining for uranium on their land. Their opposition was noted as early in 1977 when the final report of the Fox inquiry set up by the Whitlam government found that traditional owners opposed mining but “felt that having got so far, the white man is not likely to stop”. The head of the inquiry, Russell Fox, said that the wishes of the Indigenous people should be considered but continued: “In the end, we form the conclusion that their opposition should not be allowed to prevail.” The mine was approved by the Fraser government to open in 1980. That was it until 1998, when the ERA, then owned by North Ltd, began a campaign to start a new mine at Jabiluka. That was opposed by an alliance of the Mirarr, led by Yvonne Margarula, and green groups, who held a nine-month blockade of the mine site. About 5,000 people took part and more than 500 were arrested. “It was high stakes,” says Dave Sweeney, a nuclear campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation who was involved with the blockade. “The mining company was intent on developing this, it had the full support of the Northern Territory government – then the CLP, the Country Liberal party. They had the full support of the federal government. What Sweeney calls a “green-black” alliance also held protests outside the Sydney offices of ERA and North Ltd in Melbourne. “Both of those corporate headquarters were the focus of pretty sustained and sometimes pretty rowdy protests,” Sweeney says. North was taken over by Rio Tinto in 2000. Rio wanted North’s lucrative iron ore assets. It attempted to sell off ERA but, after failing to get a good price, hung on to the asset and continued to mine at Ranger. “We very quickly turned our attention to Rio Tinto. We expected a big argument with them,” says Justin O’Brien, the chief executive of the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, which represents the Mirarr. “And we found that they were willing to step back and to provide free prior and informed consent to Jabiluka.” Rio signed a care and maintenance agreement with the Mirarr people in 2005 that stops it mining Jabiluka unless the traditional owners consent. By 2012, the Ranger mine was tapped out. Processing of stockpiled uranium ore continued until last year, but since then the mine has been nothing but a vast hole in the ground that ERA is responsible for filling at an ever-increasing cost. When Rio looks at ERA, it sees little more than this multibillion-dollar liability. It values shares in the company at about 2c, about a tenth of their current market price. Rio also cannot afford any further damage to its relationship with First Nations people, after blowing up ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. That disaster cost the jobs of three senior executives, including the CEO. Kellie Parker, whose position of Australia CEO was created in response to the Juukan Gorge disaster, says the debacle taught the company that “Rio Tinto doesn’t have a home, we’re always hosted on someone else’s country”. “So, here in this situation, it’s the Mirarr people. They are the most important and understanding what they want and understanding how they want to see the future is critical,” Parker says. Rio also doesn’t currently think uranium is among minerals needed to decarbonise the world economy. “Of course there is a public conversation that needs to happen in Australia about whether they want uranium mining,” Parker says. “At the moment, we don’t see that that actually has public support. “So we’re fully committed to Ranger rehabilitation and we’re staying within our critical minerals – our copper, aluminium – and decarbonising iron ore.” A carbon-lite resource Where Rio sees an expensive hole, ERA’s minority shareholders see the opposite – a clean, green, multibillion-dollar opportunity. Willy Packer, of Packer &amp; Co, which owns 7.9% of ERA, describes Jabiluka as a “magical” deposit that can help fight global warming. “If Rio truly believes ERA shares are worth 2c, or less than one tenth of their market value, then Rio should put its stake in ERA on the market and let someone else with long-term commitment take control of this incredible asset,” he says. Another minority shareholder, Richard Magides, of Zentree Investments, says previous estimates value the uranium at Jabiluka and below Ranger as high as $25bn. “Nuclear power is without doubt a vital source of zero-carbon base load power and has been described by many environmental scientists as critical in addressing [climate change],” he says. Sweeney says that while it is true that nuclear power is low carbon, “that’s not the only lens for what is desirable, responsible, or less desirable and risky”. “If it was easy, if it was sensible, if it was good, they would have done it,” he says. While Magides and Packer dream of a nuclear boom that would make Jabiluka worth tens of billions of dollars, the valuation report released last week came up with a more conservative price tag of $1.1bn. But O’Brien says the valuation is “completely absurd”. “The traditional owners have said no so many times,” he says. “It is never going to happen. Its value is zero.” To those still pushing uranium mining in Kakadu, he had one message: “It’s over. Walk away.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/19/scholz-stalls-on-ukraine-tanks-decision-but-looks-poised-to-give-go-ahead","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T19:54:57Z","webTitle":"Scholz stalls on Ukraine tanks decision but looks poised to give go-ahead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/19/scholz-stalls-on-ukraine-tanks-decision-but-looks-poised-to-give-go-ahead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/19/scholz-stalls-on-ukraine-tanks-decision-but-looks-poised-to-give-go-ahead","fields":{"headline":"Scholz stalls on Ukraine tanks decision but looks poised to give go-ahead","bodyText":"Less than a year ago it would have seemed barely imaginable that the German state would be supplying arms in a conflict. Yet now the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, finds himself under mounting international pressure to give an unconditional green light for German-made tanks to be sent to Ukraine – having tentatively signalled his readiness to do so, but only if the US agrees to do the same. Even though Germany is often reluctant to spread the message itself, it is among Ukraine’s leading supporters in terms of defence aid and humanitarian and economic help. It has given refuge to hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, a very underreported aspect of its support. Its policy shift on Russian gas – from which German industry profited for so long, and which it has managed to wean itself off in double-quick time (even as it has opened a new brown coal opencast mine and extended the life of three nuclear power plants) is a reminder of how good at swift U-turns Germany can be. Scholz has made clear he wants to protect Germany from accusations of going it alone. Since the start of the invasion, he has repeatedly expressed his insistence that Germany will only commit to an increase in military support if it is in conjunction with a decision from other countries to do the same. Ukraine has continuously stressed that the tanks are necessary to give its troops the mobile firepower they need to drive out Russian troops. Scholz used an address to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday to insist that Germany would “continue, together with our partners” to deliver weapons in large quantities. He went on to cite at length the list of specific items Germany had already sent, including anti-aircraft systems, artillery guns and armoured personnel carriers, calling it part of a deep and extensive “sea change” in German foreign and security policy. But he stopped short of responding to Ukraine’s request for Leopard 2 tanks, even as he was repeatedly pushed to do so. Wolfgang Ischinger, a former head of the Munich Security Conference, warned Scholz that he was in danger of isolating Germany. “The whole world is waiting for Germany – with or without the USA – to give the green light,” he told the broadcaster DLF. Observers of the Scholz government believe that even as its message over arms to Ukraine has more often than not appeared ambivalent, the fact that Germany has so far committed to the effort in a manner that would have seemed almost unthinkable before the invasion is a strong indication that it will soon say yes to the tanks. It nevertheless remains morally trapped, on the one hand by the haunting fact that continues to horrify many Germans – that under the Nazis, it was fighting on Ukrainian soil against ancestors of the very people it now wants to protect – and on the other by the fact that it is as a direct result of that war that it has more of an obligation than any other country towards Ukraine. Scholz’s struggle has been to communicate domestically, in particular, the necessity to protect Ukrainians, even as he fears that to upgrade to contributing fighter tanks could risk an escalation of the conflict, with Germany pinpointed as an aggressor. Critics meanwhile are quick to point out that Germany’s defence industry has made billions from exporting lethal weapons to highly questionable regimes around the world. In this light, they argue, its hesitancy to provide a fledgling democracy on its doorstep with the means – in the form of its bestselling Leopard – to defend itself against Russian aggression is perverse. An editorial in the Süddeutsche Zeitung said Scholz could be expected to deliver the tanks, explaining it was in his manner to put off making decisions until there was no other choice. It expressed sympathy for his hesitancy. “It is far from being cut and dried that Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, will continue to take it on the chin that Nato states are increasingly involved in the war. Might he consider the use of atomic weapons in the case he feels he is at an impasse? No one can exclude this possibility,” it said. But it said Scholz would have no other option than to deliver the tanks, owing to his promise to “support Kyiv until the war is over” and the “undeniable” fact that tanks would help Ukraine fend off attacks from Putin’s army. “He will jump through the hoop – just too late for many who have been holding it up for him for months,” the paper wrote. Ralf Stegner, of the Social Democrats, stuck up for Scholz during a Bundestag debate on the future of weapons to Ukraine on Thursday. What others called “hesitation” was “in truth intelligent leadership”, he said, while one member of the conservative CDU said history was in danger of remembering the current German government as being most efficient as “a brake block”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/12/ukraine-russia-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-201-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-12T13:10:16Z","webTitle":"Ukraine-Russia war latest: what we know on day 201 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/12/ukraine-russia-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-201-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/12/ukraine-russia-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-201-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine-Russia war latest: what we know on day 201 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukrainian forces have recaptured about 500 sq km of territory in the south of the country over the past two weeks, Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command, said on Monday. This includes five settlements in the Kherson region, Humeniuk said. The Kremlin responded Monday to Ukraine’s weekend advances by doubling down and saying that Russia will achieve the goals of its “special military operation”. In this same call, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said that there were no discussions taking place about the possible demilitarisation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, despite it being one of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s key recommendations from its visit to the plant. Russian missile strikes on Monday have once again knocked out power and halted the water supply in Kharkiv, said Ihor Terekhov, the mayor of Kharkiv city, on Telegram. The shelling targeting the region’s infrastructure came after rescue workers had restored about 80% of the power and water to the region following more targeted attacks the day before. Both Terekhov and Volodymyr Zelenskiy have decried these attacks on infrastructure as “Russian terrorists”. “No military facilities [were attacked],” the Ukrainian president said in a statement on social media. “The goal is to deprive people of light and heat.” At least 1,000 people have been killed in the last six months fighting in Izium, a city in north-eastern Ukraine. Izium is one of the more than 20 towns and villages that Ukraine’s general staff said its forces had recaptured in the past days, as part of a counteroffensive that has forced Russian forces to abandon their positions and leave behind huge stocks of ammunition and equipment. Now with the city back in Ukrainian hands, officials are able to assess its losses and warned that the real figure of people killed since Russian forces took the city as a main stronghold is probably much higher. Russian forces launched 11 missiles against eastern Ukraine overnight, the Ukrainian air force announced in a tweet on Sunday night, causing a total blackout in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, and partial blackouts in the Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy regions. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, said Kharkiv’s CHPP-5 electricity station – one of the largest in Ukraine – had been hit. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, said later that power had been restored in some regions. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, denounced Russia’s strikes on the power and water facilities. “Russia’s apparent response to Ukraine liberating cities and villages in the east: sending missiles to attempt to destroy critical civilian infrastructure,” Brink tweeted. The general commanding Russia’s western army group has been sacked after the retreat in the Kharkiv region, according to Ukrainian military intelligence. It reported on its Telegram channel that Gen Roman Berdnikov has been replaced after only 17 days in his post, the GUR said. The success of Ukrainian forces in pushing Russian troops out of the Kharkiv region “have significant implications for Russia’s overall operational design”, according to the UK Ministry of Defence, and for the morale of its soldiers on the ground. “The majority of the force in Ukraine is highly likely being forced to prioritise emergency defensive actions. The already limited trust deployed troops have in Russia’s senior military leadership is likely to deteriorate further.” Kirill Stremousov, one of the leaders of the Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Kherson in southern Ukraine, has questioned the situation to the north, saying that “Kherson is and will be a Russian city. No one is going to surrender the city, let alone retreat. Regarding the situation in the Kharkiv region, many of us are at a loss about the current situation.” Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish long-term ally of Russia’s president, and currently deputy chairman of the security council of Russia, has threatened Ukraine again, saying: “Zelenskiy said that he would not engage in dialogue with those who put forward ultimatums. The current ‘ultimatums’ are a child’s warm-up for the demands of the future. And he knows them: the total capitulation of the Kyiv regime on Russia’s terms.” Western governments are mobilising their arms manufacturers to ramp up production and replenish stockpiles heavily diminished by supplying Ukraine’s six-month-old battle against Russia’s invasion. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, is organising a meeting of senior national armaments directors from allied countries to make long-term plans for supplying Ukraine and rebuilding their own arms reserves. The acting United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Nada al-Nashif, said on Monday morning that Russia was intimidating opponents of the war in Ukraine. “In the Russian Federation, the intimidation, restrictive measures and sanctions against people voicing opposition to the war in Ukraine undermine the exercise of constitutionally guaranteed fundamental freedoms, including the rights to free assembly, expression and association.” Joe Biden’s new ambassador in Berlin has urged Olaf Scholz’s government to “take more of a leadership role”, as calls grow for Germany to support Ukraine’s advances in the north-east by delivering tanks. After praising Germany’s military and financial support for Kyiv, the US ambassador, Amy Guttmann, told broadcaster ZDF “my expectations for Germany are higher”. Ukraine on Sunday shut down the last operating reactor at Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant to guard against a catastrophe as fighting rages nearby. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia plant, risking a release of radiation. The International Atomic Energy Agency said a backup power line to the plant had been restored, providing the external electricity it needed to carry out the shutdown while defending against the risk of a meltdown. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, told Putin in a phone call on Sunday the plant’s occupation by Russian troops is the reason why its security is compromised, the French presidency said. Putin blamed Ukrainian forces, according to a Kremlin statement. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-appointed leader of Chechnya, has criticised the Russian army’s leadership after it appeared to be caught off-guard by Ukraine’s fightback against the Russian invasion in the north-east. In a sign that the Kremlin may face serious fallout over the loss of territory that the Russian occupation administrations had repeatedly stated they planned to keep “forever”, Kadyrov also suggested that Vladimir Putin might not be aware of the real state of affairs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-330-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T10:51:42Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 330 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-330-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-330-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 330 of the invasion","bodyText":"Oleksiy Kuleba, governor of Kyiv, said Thursday that ten adults and six children remain in hospital following Wednesday’s helicopter crash which claimed the life of interior minister Denys Monastyrskiy and 14 other people. Kuleba said families of the victims will receive financial assistance, and that children from the kindergarten damaged when the helicopter fell are studying in nearby preschools. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne is reporting that eleven people are still considered missing after Saturday’s attack on a high-rise building in Dnipro. The Kremlin said on Thursday that Ukrainian strikes on Russian-annexed Crimea would be “extremely dangerous”, after the New York Times reported that US officials were warming to the idea of helping Kyiv strike the peninsula. “This will mean raising the conflict to a new level that will not bode well for European security”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters at his daily briefing. Crimea, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, was annexed by Russia in 2014. The comments came as the Sweden announced it would be sending the Archer artillery system for use by Kyiv, a vehicle-mounted self-propelled gun howitzer made by Bofors BAE. The country has also committed to sending infantry fighting vehicles in a move announced in a press conference in Stockholm on Thursday morning. The British and Polish defence ministers will meet with their counterparts from the Baltic states in Estonia, in a Ramstein pre-meeting – ahead of a wider defence summit on Friday – designed to put further pressure on Germany to move forward with sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. A government source in Berlin told Reuters Germany will send German-made tanks to Ukraine so long as the United States agrees to do likewise, as Nato partners remained out of step over how best to arm Ukraine in its war against Russia. Germany’s president Frank-Walter Steinmeier promised further military support to Ukraine and warned the incoming defence minister that Germany’s armed forces must once again become capable of protecting the nation. Social Democrat Boris Pistorius was officially made minister on Thursday in a ceremony attended by Steinmeier. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy”. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish long-term ally of Vladimir Putin, has warned of a nuclear escalation if Russia is defeated in Ukraine, saying that western politicians “repeated like a mantra: ‘To achieve peace, Russia must lose’”, but “it never occurs to any of them to draw the following elementary conclusion from this: the loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the outbreak of a nuclear war”. Peskov later said the comments made by the deputy chairman of the security council of Russia were fully in accordance with Russia’s nuclear doctrine. Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, said people can spend too much time obsessing about Putin, and worrying about escalating the conflict. “How can you escalate against a guy who is doing all out war against a civilian population?”, he said. He also cast doubt on whether Russia would use nuclear weapons and internationally isolate itself from countries like China. Canada announced Wednesday it would donate 200 armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”, referring to the helicopter crash in Brovary. Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country – one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow – provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel. Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, saying current levels of assistance were inadequate. Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts. “We notice a gradual increase in the number of shelling occasions and attempts at offensive actions by the occupiers,” Zelenskiy said in his latest address."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/10/morning-mail-mps-hillsong-claims-climate-coffee-shock-catholic-order-in-court-over-school-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T19:55:02Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: MP’s Hillsong claims, climate ‘coffee shock’, Catholic order in court over school abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/10/morning-mail-mps-hillsong-claims-climate-coffee-shock-catholic-order-in-court-over-school-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/10/morning-mail-mps-hillsong-claims-climate-coffee-shock-catholic-order-in-court-over-school-abuse","fields":{"headline":"Morning Mail: MP’s Hillsong claims, climate ‘coffee shock’, Catholic order in court over school abuse","bodyText":"Morning everyone. Armed with two large stacks of folders, the independent MP Andrew Wilkie ended the parliamentary week with an extraordinary set of accusations about the Hillsong church, including using funds for shopping that “would embarrass a Kardashian”. We’ve got the full story, plus how climate change could cause a shortage of your favourite coffee beans, and the day that cricket met Game of Thrones. Australia Coffee shock | Australians could run short of their favourite beans because changing climate conditions that reduce the yield have become more frequent over the past four decades, raising the prospect of “systemic shocks” to production, researchers say. Hillsong claims | Andrew Wilkie has used parliamentary privilege to accuse the mega-church Hillsong of money laundering and tax evasion which he says is proved by leaked documents. Wilkie claimed the church had used “private jets like Ubers” and lavished money on luxury watches, luggage sets and holidays. But the church has disputed many of the accusations as false or out of context. Church charge | A Catholic order is expected to argue today it should be shielded from abuse claims relating to one of the worst paedophiles in the New South Wales Catholic school system because he is dead, despite allegedly concealing his crimes from authorities for decades. NSW election | The Perrottet government has introduced new rules that will grant coalmines licences for water from the drinking catchment for Sydney and the Illawarra region, in what opponents called a “cynical” move. ‘It’s ginormous’ | An out-of-control bushfire in New South Wales’s central west could keep going for weeks, the Rural Fire Service has warned, after it blazed through properties and scorched bushland. World ‘No evidence’ | Dominion Voter Systems and Fox News have exchanged further barbs. The voting machine company is asking a judge to settle its $1.6bn libel case in its favour because Fox had “produced no evidence” supporting its claims of vote rigging in the 2020 election. Missile barrage | Russia has unleashed its largest missile attack on Ukraine in weeks, targeting energy infrastructure including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, while Kyiv’s forces are still holding on in Bakhmut despite heavy casualties. Trudeau pressure | Justin Trudeau is under mounting pressure to explain how his government has responded to the threat of Chinese interference in Canadian elections after damning intelligence leaks. ‘Jaw-dropping’ | The pay packet for the recently departed chief executive of Shell jumped more than 50% to nearly £10m (A$18m) in 2022 including a bonus labelled “jaw-dropping” by campaigners. ‘Are you kidding?’ | Basic Instinct star Sharon Stone says judicial prejudice caused her to lose custody of her son after the presiding judge in her 2004 divorce case asked the four-year-old whether he knew his mother made “sex movies”. Full Story Is the UK adopting Australia’s cruel mistakes? – with Lenore Taylor As the British government launches its own “stop the boats” policy, Lenore Taylor and Mike Ticher discuss the enduring inhumanity of Australia’s immigration regime and whether the UK will learn from our mistakes. In-depth Australia is expected to buy both US and British-designed nuclear submarines in a deal that is anticipated to be unveiled next week when Anthony Albanese attends an Aukus defence pact summit with the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US president, Joe Biden, in San Diego. Our defence correspondent, Daniel Hurst, has been talking to the man in charge of the nuclear subs project, V Adm Jonathan Mead, who has hailed it as a “generational challenge” that will transform Australia’s “strategic personality”. Not the news Our writers have been sifting through the best Australian books to be published this week (pictured) and they include Sam Neill’s eagerly awaited memoir, Did I Ever Tell You This?, as well as Infidelity and Other Affairs by Kate Legge, which details the impact of her husband’s 30-year-long philandering. We’ve also got Margaret Simons’s biography of Tanya Plibersek, forged, apparently, by a mutual love of Jane Austen. The world of sport Cricket | Usman Khawaja’s resilient century has put Australia into a position of dominance after the first day of the fourth Test, confirming his place as currently the team’s most important batsman. The cricket was preceded by a bizarre political rally for Indian PM Narendra Modi which also featured Anthony Albanese, pictured. Football | Manchester United have added Chelsea’s Mason Mount to a list of attacking midfield targets including Jude Bellingham, along with a possible bid for Harry Kane. Women’s World Cup | Corinne Diacre has been sacked a coach of the French women’s team after some stars refused to play in the World Cup. Media roundup The Herald Sun says there are fears for jobs at the Maryvale Mill, Latrobe Valley’s biggest employer, with the state government accused of not doing enough to save the sector. The NT News reports on a “dramatic” navy rescue of six people on board a luxury yacht that got into difficulties in the Arafura Sea off Indonesia. And the Australian reports on a Senate committee that’s recommending the government set up a trial of a four-day work week.

The video was taken down, but not before it received 18m views. Welcome to the Russia-Ukraine conflict on TikTok. TikTok has 1 billion users worldwide and is an important news source for adults and particularly those under 25. A quarter of US adults say they always use TikTok to get the news, with nearly half of US millennial and Gen Z adults – under-41s and under-25s respectively – indicating the same, according to analysis firm Forrester Research. Mike Proulx, a research director at Forrester, says TikTok’s algorithm, which curates what users see, has combined with the app’s popularity to make it a compelling outlet for people looking for information on the conflict. “The confluence of social media and mobile has enabled everyone to be instant, on-the-ground publishers. Add TikTok’s algorithm and popularity into the mix, and you get the perfect storm of content virality,” he says. According to Forrester, half of adults under 25 in the UK use TikTok at least once a week. Ukraine footage on TikTok varies wildly, from satirical commentary to false footage and accurate news clips. A London-based TikToker, Nikita Redkar, has received nearly 3m views for her tongue-in-cheek clip describing the conflict like a relationship breakdown: “Back in the 90s Russia and Ukraine used to be a thing but things got really messy and they broke up.” An even more popular follow-up post, captioned “Will there be a WW3?” continues with the theme, describing Nato as a “group of besties” who cannot support Ukraine because “you don’t roll with the crew”. Pdotz, a popular British TikToker with more than half a million followers, has received about 3m views for his explainers on the conflict. Other posts are from TikTok users presenting looped footage as live images from the conflict. An example of this included a video flagged by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) in which live footage purportedly from the point of view of a Ukrainian soldier was in fact on a loop. The account that posed the footage, and similar videos, received millions of views before disappearing. CCDH says it is problematic that TikTok videos do not show where a clip was posted, meaning that viewers are unable to discern whether footage ostensibly from the frontlines of the conflict is posted from Moscow, for instance. Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of CCDH, says TikTok has unique features that allow the rapid spread of false information. “The algorithm is currently aggressively promoting Ukraine-related content, irrespective of whether it’s true or not,” he said. “Unlike other platforms, it also provides users with little metadata with which users can do their own verification work – or even find out where this footage is coming from.” TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, says it took down the “RUSIA NUCLEAR BOMB” video for violating its community guidelines on integrity and authenticity. TikTok says it will also remove accounts that violate those guidelines although the account behind the nuclear video is still live. A TikTok spokesperson said: “We continue to respond to the war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources to detect emerging threats and remove harmful misinformation and other violations of our community guidelines. We also partner with independent factchecking organisations to support our efforts to help TikTok remain a safe and authentic place.” TikToks about misinformation, and how to spot it, are also proving popular. Abbie Richards, a TikToker with 536,000 followers who regularly posts on misinformation, has received more than half a million views for her guide to spotting false videos – including overdubbed audio and recycling old footage. Old footage has proved popular. One video captioned “Ukrainian soldiers saying goodbye to their families” has had 2.8m views but is clearly footage of US soldiers and their loved ones. Video game footage has also been adapted, with one clip purportedly showing a Ukrainian jet downing a Russian fighter – which has had nearly 10m views and is still live – but can be traced to a YouTube video made on a flight simulator game. The ITV News TikTok account is posting regularly on Ukraine and is garnering up to 400,000 views for its posts, but pales in comparison with less expert accounts with the same, or fewer, followers. There is nothing unusual about TikTok’s algorithm compared with other platforms, according to Julian McAuley, a professor of computer science at the University of California, San Diego. “TikTok uses fairly ‘standard’ recommendation technology that will mostly recommend content that’s consistent with what users have previously engaged with. If users frequently consume misinformation (or slanted content), they’re likely to see more of it.” Russian influencers are also getting involved. Niki Proshin, a 27-year-old Russian TikToker with 765,00 followers, posted a video in which he said he was speaking for “regular Russians” and “normal people in Russia do not support this [war]”. Meanwhile, Marta Vasyuta, a Ukrainian-British TikToker with 187,000 followers, has been regularly posting footage of the conflict that has attracted millions of views from users on the platform. Asked why she was posting the footage, Vasyuta said: “I want more people to be aware about what is going on in my country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/04/sainsburys-renames-chicken-kievs-kyivrussian-made-vodka-uk-supermarket-soviet-spelling-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T19:13:00Z","webTitle":"Sainsbury’s renames chicken kievs and pulls Russian-made vodka","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/sainsburys-renames-chicken-kievs-kyivrussian-made-vodka-uk-supermarket-soviet-spelling-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/04/sainsburys-renames-chicken-kievs-kyivrussian-made-vodka-uk-supermarket-soviet-spelling-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Sainsbury’s renames chicken kievs and pulls Russian-made vodka","bodyText":"Sainsbury’s is changing the name of its chicken kiev to chicken kyiv and is joining Waitrose, Aldi and Morrisons in withdrawing a Russian-made vodka from the shelves in the latest action by British retailers to signal solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The UK’s second biggest supermarket said the packaging for the poultry dish would change in the next few weeks, switching the Soviet-era name for the country’s capital for the Ukrainian version. The move comes after several smaller operators announced a switch to chicken kyiv, including the Better Naked brand and Essex-based Our Local Butcher. Marks &amp; Spencer, which popularised the dish in the UK after making chicken kiev one of the first ready meals in 1979, has also come under pressure to rename the dish. A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s said: “We stand united with the people of Ukraine. We have reviewed our product range and have decided to remove from sale all products that are 100% sourced from Russia. “This means that from today we will no longer sell two products – Russian Standard vodka and Karpayskiye black sunflower seeds.” Sainsbury’s said it had also reviewed JJ Whitley products, a range of vodkas and other spirits made in Russia. It said those would continue to be sold in its supermarkets as the drinks company had said it was moving all production to Chorley in Lancashire by the end of this month. Waitrose said on Friday it would be removing one Russian vodka, while its sister department store chain, John Lewis, will remove a line of pizza oven pellets that are sourced from Russia. Aldi said it would remove Russian vodka on Friday after the Co-op and Morrisons did the same earlier in the week. Carmen Bryan, consumer analyst at GlobalData, said: “Governments have been implementing sanctions, however, it is interesting to see similar moves from the wider public and independent businesses. “GlobalData’s survey reveals that brand loyalty is heavily influenced by alignment to one’s values. This puts Russian vodka brands in a precarious position, as prolonged conflict will not only damage immediate sales, but may also cause permanent disillusionment against Russian commodities in the long-term.” The removal of Russian vodka from supermarket shelves comes after M&amp;S suspended shipments to its franchisee’s business in Russia on Thursday. It joined a rush of western firms halting operations in Russia, including Swedish furnishing retailer Ikea, which announced that it had temporarily closed all stores and factories across the country in a move affecting 15,000 workers. On Friday, JD Sports, which sells to Russia via its website, said it was joining British online retailers Boohoo and Asos in suspending sales in the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/mar/04/uk-to-speed-up-sanctions-on-russian-oligarchs-by-copying-allies-decisions","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T19:10:02Z","webTitle":"UK to speed up sanctions on Russian oligarchs by copying allies’ decisions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/04/uk-to-speed-up-sanctions-on-russian-oligarchs-by-copying-allies-decisions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/mar/04/uk-to-speed-up-sanctions-on-russian-oligarchs-by-copying-allies-decisions","fields":{"headline":"UK to speed up sanctions on Russian oligarchs by copying allies’ decisions","bodyText":"The UK government is planning emergency powers to immediately sanction people who have already been sanctioned by the US or EU, in response to a barrage of criticism that it has been too slow to target Russian oligarchs. Amendments to sanctions laws tabled by Priti Patel, the home secretary, would introduce a new “urgent procedure” to give the UK the legal ability to sanction individuals on the basis of other countries while it builds up its own cases. Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, prompting a wave of financial sanctions from the EU and the US. However, on Friday the UK had only imposed sanctions on 15 individuals and 205 companies. The urgent designation will be limited to 56 days, according to the amendment, seen by the Guardian. That would mean that Foreign Office officials would still have to build up a legal case for the sanctions to the same standards. However, it could allow UK officials to move more quickly to follow allies. Officials in EU member states have expressed frustrations about the UK’s slow pace. On Thursday, Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s first vice-president said the UK would “continue to follow the [EU’s] lead because the pressure of the public opinion in the UK is very clear about this”. The changes are being brought as part of amendments to a long-delayed economic crime bill that has been spurred by the invasion. They are aimed at “streamlining the process by which an appropriate minister can make designations for the purposes of sanctions regulations”, according to an attached explanatory statement. The amendment says that the minister can rely on “corresponding” provisions brought under laws in the USA, the EU, Australia and Canada, as well as any other country specified by ministers. Dame Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP who has long campaigned for tougher anti-corruption laws, said the amendments appeared to be “a win for parliament” that would give the power to sanction Russian oligarchs more quickly. “The government is seeing sense and putting in place the emergency legislation that we have been calling for to ensure that we can quickly sanction the Russian oligarchs propping up Putin’s regime,” she said. “For too long the UK has been the jurisdiction of choice for dirty money. And now we are a global laughing stock as we have lagged behind our allies with our utter failure to effectively sanction Putin’s oligarch cronies.” Tom Keatinge, a financial crime expert at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank (RUSI), said the changes may reflect a realisation in government that it has been unable to act quickly enough during the crisis. “Clearly the UK’s frustration with its ability to enact its own laws means it is going to have to rely on the designations of other countries,” he said. Other amendments include reducing an implementation period for foreign owners to declare their beneficial ownership of UK property from 18 months to six months – as called for by Hodge and other MPs – as well as raising minimum daily fines for failing to disclose information required under the economic crime bill from £500 to £2,500. Hodge said: “Tougher financial penalties and a six-month implementation period will make the new property register more effective in shining a light on any crook or kleptocrat that wishes to use our property market to hide their ill-gotten gains.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2022/mar/04/uk-universities-impact-sanctions-russia-academmics-boycott","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T10:17:25Z","webTitle":"UK universities brace for impact of sanctions against Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/04/uk-universities-impact-sanctions-russia-academmics-boycott","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2022/mar/04/uk-universities-impact-sanctions-russia-academmics-boycott","fields":{"headline":"UK universities brace for impact of sanctions against Russia","bodyText":"Researchers at UK universities are bracing themselves for sanctions affecting science partnerships with Russia, including in climate science and space research, as the government seeks to isolate Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine. Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Oxford, said most academics would support a research boycott with heavy hearts and concerns for Russian colleagues. “All the Russian academics I know oppose the war. The internal situation in Russia will get nastier and they will need solidarity, so there is a case for maintaining ties,” he said. Germany announced that all collaboration with Russia on education and research was being halted immediately. Its ministry of education said Russia had “turned its back on the international community” by invading Ukraine and was committing a “grave breach of international law” with no justification. This week George Freeman, the UK science minister, said he had ordered “a rapid review” of all Russian beneficiaries of UK science and technology funding. Experts say possible sanctions could include a ban on British academics collaborating with Russian scientists, the freezing of any joint funding, and the exclusion of Russian scientists from reading or publishing in international scientific journals. Prof Colin Riordan, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, a member of the prestigious Russell Group, said some Cardiff academics had withdrawn from events in Russia of their own accord. If the government were to tell his university to cut ties with Russia, it would do so because of the “bigger things at stake”. But he said the government should be careful about any blanket ruling banning all collaboration with Russian academics. “We need to distinguish between the government and citizens of Russia who find themselves in an extremely difficult position,” he said. Prof Steve West, the president of the vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK, told the Guardian: “I think we have to expect science sanctions. The position of universities is always that scientific collaboration and research are a vital global endeavour. However, what is happening is a challenge on democracy and the safety and stability of the free world.” Academics in Russia, thousands of whom have signed open letters opposing the war, say their international relationships are fracturing. They say academics from across Europe are cancelling trips and pulling out of partnerships. Almost 4,000 academics, students and graduates of the prestigious Moscow State University, Russia’s oldest university, have signed a letter saying they “categorically condemn the war that our country unleashed in Ukraine”. The letter says: “There is no room for euphemisms or excuses. War is violence, cruelty, death, loss of loved ones, powerlessness and fear that cannot be justified by any goal.” Another condemnatory open letter on Thursday had been signed by more than 15,000 Russian academics and students. A senior Russian scientist, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said some science leaders had been accused of “betraying the motherland” by speaking out against the war. Many were afraid to sign the letters because of a “culture of fear”. “People in the west do not fully understand the pain we feel,” he said. “It is like England invading Scotland. Many of us have relatives in Ukraine or were born there.” He said he knew academics in Russia who had written privately to research partners in the UK and other countries, stressing that they did not support the invasion of Ukraine, and expressing hope that they might find a way of continuing to work together. A Russian scientist in St Petersburg, who said he had been chased by riot police this week, tweeted: “I’m so disgusted with rejection letters, invitation cancellations, grant withdrawals against Russian scholars from Western academics who fight Putinism by attacking those who have suffered from it for decades.” A Russian climate scientist based at a leading Russell Group university in the UK, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his field work, which was based in Russia and involved Russian scientists in different disciplines, looked likely to grind to a halt. A joint expedition he had been planning with colleagues in Moscow has been cancelled. “Russia is such a huge territory and we will lose so much empirical data. This will be a really big blow for climate science.” The scientist, who said he was “appalled and devastated” by the invasion of Ukraine, added: “The majority of academics in Russia are not fans of the current regime, and of course sanctions will strike right at them.” Paul Nightingale, a professor of strategy at Sussex’s University’s science policy research unit, said measures should be adopted that would “be brutal and would achieve the aim of turning more people against Putin”. In addition to curbs on collaboration and publishing, Britain and the US could consider offering five-year working visas to every Russian with a PhD, he said, to prompt a brain drain from the country, although he added that this could damage hopes of Russia becoming a more liberal society in the future. Nightingale, formerly a director of special projects at the UK government’s Economic and Social Research Council, said he was in favour of sanctions to isolate Putin in the coming weeks, but they must be imposed carefully to avoid killing the possibility of useful academic diplomacy. “Even during the worst of the cold war, American, European and Russian scientists would work together on important problems,” he said. “Those social networks provided really important back channels for communication. “Unfortunately the people we would be hurting most in trying to damage Putin would be our friends.” Isak Froumin, professor of higher education at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said global science had been very important to Putin’s regime. Until 2018 the Russian government was pushing universities hard to play more of a role in global science by collaborating with researchers abroad and publishing in international journals, he said. “International collaboration in science was considered absolutely necessary and prestigious.” He added: “The idea that might be all broken is a great shock to scientists.” Prof James Wilsdon, the director of the Research on Research Institute, based at Sheffield University, said the UK government was likely to focus sanctions on areas with strategic security implications for Russia, including climate science in the arctic and space research. He warned that in the longer term ministers must be careful not to “choke off the good”. “Links in science are a very important part of maintaining what spark of freedom there is in Russia,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/15/russia-ukraine-war-moscows-forces-attempt-advance-in-donetsk-putin-vows-to-expand-relations-with-north-korea-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T18:00:34Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Moscow’s forces attempt advance in Donetsk; Putin vows to expand relations with North Korea – live ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/15/russia-ukraine-war-moscows-forces-attempt-advance-in-donetsk-putin-vows-to-expand-relations-with-north-korea-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/15/russia-ukraine-war-moscows-forces-attempt-advance-in-donetsk-putin-vows-to-expand-relations-with-north-korea-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: at least three people die in Donetsk shelling; Kyiv mayor warns of cold winter due to gas shortages – as it happened","bodyText":"It is just after 9pm in Ukraine. Here are some things you might’ve missed: At least three civilians have been killed in Russian shelling in the eastern region of Donetsk. Thirteen were wounded in artillery barrages from the Russian military, Ukrainian officials said on Monday. Ukraine says it has struck a base used by the Wagner paramilitary group, according to reports. A bridge near the occupied city of Melitopol was also hit, according to reports from AFP. Five people have been injured in Kharkiv after Russian shelling. Two of them in a serious condition, a top Ukrainian official has said. Putin says Russia is ready to offer allies in Latin American, Asia and Africa ‘advanced’ weapons. The UN has said it can facilitate an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visit to Ukraine’s damaged Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant if both Russia and Ukraine agree. A total of 42 countries have called on Russia to immediately withdraw military forces from the plant, including the US, Japan and the UK, plus the EU. The IAEA has warned of a possible nuclear disaster unless fighting stops. On Poland’s Armed Forces Day on Monday, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief Valeriy Zaluzhnyi released a video statement commemorating the national holiday. In the video, he says, speaking in Polish, “Today, just like 102 years ago, we once again face a centuries-old enemy together” The holiday celebrates the anniversary of the 1920 victory over Soviet Russia at the Battle of Warsaw. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, says Russia and North Korea will expand bilateral relations. Pyongyang’s state media reported on Monday. Putin told North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that the two countries would “expand the comprehensive and constructive bilateral relations with common efforts”, Pyongyang’s state media reported on Monday. In a letter to Kim for North Korea’s liberation day, Putin said that closer ties would be in both countries’ interests, and would help strengthen the security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the north-eastern Asian region, North Korea’s KCNA news agency said. Kyiv Mayor warns of a cold winter for citizens, due to gas shortages. Former boxing champion and mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko said he did not want to reassure residents that “everything will be fine” and that there were “harsh realities” in the country. That is all from us today. Thanks for reading along, we will be back with the latest Ukraine news tomorrow. The UN has said it can facilitate IAEA visit to power plant if Russia and Ukraine agree. The United Nations has the logistics and security capacity to support a visit by International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant if both Russia and Ukraine agree, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Monday. The plant, built in the Soviet era, is the largest nuclear reactor in Europe and was damaged by Russian shelling in early August. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has accused the Russians of using the plant as a “nuclear shield”. Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, described the ongoing crisis of safety oversight as a dire threat to public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond, describing the situation as “completely out of control.” “You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,” he said. While Grossi has suggested a mission to the plant, Ukraine has been blocking the initiative, arguing as recently as June that any visit would legitimise Russia’s presence there. Five foreign nationals captured fighting with Ukrainian forces have been charged with being mercenaries on Monday, with three facing the death penalty, Russian media has reported. The trial was carried out by a Russian-backed separatist court in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk. U.K. national John Harding, Croatian Vjekoslav Prebeg and Swedish citizen Mathias Gustafsson, who were captured in and around the port city of Mariupol, face a possible death sentence, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported. TASS cited the judge as saying that the trial would resume in early October, according to reports from Reuters. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz questioned the Russian tourist ban, following a meeting with leaders of the Nordic countries in Oslo on Monday. “What is important for us is that we understand there are a lot of people fleeing from Russia because they disagree with the Russian regime,” he said. “All the decisions we take should not make it more complicated to leave the country, for getting away from the leadership and the dictatorship in Russia,” he added. Finland’s Prime Minister Sanna Marin who was also at the meeting, has called for Russian tourists to be banned from the EU to ensure that they too pay a penalty for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny says he is in solitary confinement. In a Twitter thread posted on Monday, Navalny said he had been placed in a ‘special housing unit’ following his efforts to create a labour union in jail. Navalny had been serving two-and-a-half years for violating parole on old fraud charges but in March 2022, his jail time was extended to nine years after he was found guilty of embezzlement. Navalny and his allies say the charges are politically motivated. In 2020, Navalny narrowly survived a poisoning attack with Novichok, a Soviet-designed military-grade nerve agent. He has accused Russian authorities, but the Kremlin has denied any involvement. Ukraine on Monday said it had struck a base used by a Russian paramilitary group as well as a bridge near the occupied city of Melitopol, according to reports from AFP. Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine, told AFP the strike was aimed at a base of the Wagner group. The Guardian hasn’t been able to independently verify this report. Wagner, Russia’s private military contractor, was established in 2014 to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. The US and others say it is funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a powerful businessman closely linked to Vladimir Putin who is under western sanctions. Prigozhin denies any links to the group. My colleague Pjotr Sauer wrote a piece about the Wagner group’s involvement in Russia’s war with Ukraine, read it here: Russia’s private military contractor Wagner comes out of the shadows in Ukraine war Gen Darryl Williams, the new commanding general of United States Army Europe and Africa, attended the ceremony in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Solider in downtown Warsaw. Williams told the Associated Press that the US presence was meant to deliver a message of “strength and resilience”. “It is about deterrence, about being strong, Nato is strong, the Polish people are strong, and we are standing shoulder to shoulder with them,” he said. “Today, just like 102 years ago, we once again face a centuries-old enemy together” Ukraine’s commander-in-chief said in a statement on Poland’s annual Armed Forces Day. Poland celebrated on Monday its annual Armed Forces Day, a national holiday commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over Soviet Russia at the Battle of Warsaw. Speaking Polish, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, greeted the Polish military, saying: On behalf of the Armed Forces and in my own name, I congratulate you on the occasion of the Polish Armed Forces Day. In the Battle of Warsaw, your people defended their statehood and saved Europe from the Bolshevik invasion. Poland’s ally in that war was the Ukrainian People’s Republic. Today, just like 102 years ago, we are once again facing a centuries-old enemy together. I am deeply grateful to the Polish people for their help and support in this difficult time. We are fighting for our freedom and yours. Together we will win. According to UN figures from May, more than 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled to Poland since the Russian invasion began. At least three Ukrainian civilians have been killed and 13 wounded in artillery barrages from the Russian military in the eastern region of Donetsk, Ukrainian officials said on Monday. The barrage has damaged dozens of residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, reports Reuters. The eastern region of Donetsk – one of the two provinces making up the country’s industrial heartland of Donbas that has been the focus of a Russian offensive – has faced the most intense shelling. Regional officials said at least three people died and a further 13 were wounded by Russian shelling that hit numerous towns and villages in the Donetsk region during the last 24 hours. Russia will do “everything necessary” to allow specialists from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, a top Russian official said on Monday. In a statement reported by Reuters on Monday foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: In close cooperation with the Agency and its leadership, we will do everything necessary for the IAEA specialists to be at the station and give a truthful assessment of the destructive actions of the Ukrainian side. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the biggest in Europe, was captured by Russia during its invasion of Ukraine and has since been the source of intense fighting between the two sides. Both Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of risking a nuclear accident. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Mariano Grossi, previously described the situation as “completely out of control” and suggested a mission to the plant. However, this was blocked by Energoatom – Ukraine’s nuclear power plant operator – who thought any visit could legitimise Russia’s occupation of the area. My colleague Peter Beaumont wrote a piece about the issues at the nuclear plant, read it here: How dangerous is the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant? Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Moscow valued its ties with countries in Latin American, Asia and Africa and was ready to offer modern weapons to its allies, reports Reuters. Putin used a speech at an arms show near Moscow to boast of Russia’s advanced weapons capabilities and declare its willingness to share technology with like-minded countries. Putin told the the opening ceremony of the “Army-2022” forum near Moscow: (We) are ready to offer our allies the most modern types of weapons, from small arms to armoured vehicles and artillery to combat aviation and unmanned aerial vehicles. Almost all of them have been used more than once in real combat operations. The Russian president’s comments come just a day after he offered to expand relations with North Korea. In a letter to Kim Jong-un for Korea‘s liberation day, Putin said closer ties would be in both countries’ interests, and would help strengthen the security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the north-east Asian region, North Korea‘s KCNA news agency said. Russian soldiers are taking their families out of Melitopol, according to the BBC’s Russian service. The broadcaster reports the city’s mayor, Ivan Fedorov, saying: After the partisans and the armed forces of Ukraine have actively worked for another week, the Russian military is taking their families out of the city.” It comes after authorities in Kherson reportedly said on Sunday that some Russian commanders had left the city. Andrew Roth has the latest on Brittney Griner’s appeal against her nine-year jail sentence: Lawyers for American basketball star Brittney Griner have filed an appeal against her nine-year prison sentence for drug possession. Griner, a centre for the Phoenix Mercury who had been playing in Yekaterinburg during the WNBA off-season, was arrested in February at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport after vape canisters containing cannabis oil were found in her luggage. She was convicted on 4 August. Lawyer Maria Blagovolina said on Monday the appeal had been filed, but declined to give details. Alexander Boykov, a lawyer at Moscow Legal Centre who represented Griner in court, told Reuters the appeal would be mainly based on alleged violations in the course of the investigation. Griner’s defence team argued in court that some of her case files had been drawn up without being translated for her into English. It was not clear how soon an appeal could be heard. Read more here: Brittney Griner lawyers appeal against nine-year Russian jail sentence Former boxing champion and mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko said he did not want to reassure residents that “everything will be fine” and that there were “harsh realities” in the country. He said there will be gas for people living in the capital and it will not increase in price, but residents needed to be prepared for “different scenarios”. In an interview with Babel, he added: This is the expectation. But we do not rule out that there may be acts of terrorism, attacks on gas stations. We also take this scenario into account. We bought generators, fuel for these generators. First of all, they will go to hospitals, kindergartens and schools. We will do everything possible and impossible, which depends on us, to keep the houses warm. He urged Ukrainians living in Kyiv to prepare warm blankets and clothes at home and to be prepared for temperatures to be lower than normal, at around 18-19C. These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. Shelling in Kharkiv, a city in north-west Ukraine, has left five people injured, with two of them in a serious condition, a top Ukrainian official has said. Posting on Telegram, the head of the Kharkiv regional state administration Oleg Synegubov, said: As a result of the morning shelling of Kharkiv, 5 people were injured. According to the information of the Regional Center of Emergency Medical Assistance, 4 people were hospitalized, 2 of them are in serious condition. 1 person was treated on the spot. Medical and rescue services continue to work at the sites of the hits. It is just after 1pm in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Ukrainian forces reported heavy Russian shelling and attempts to advance on several towns in the eastern region of Donetsk that has become a key focus of the near six-month war, but said they had repelled many of the attacks. Ukraine’s military command said on Sunday that Russian soldiers had continued unsuccessfully to attack Ukrainian positions near Avdiivka, which, since 2014, has become one of the outposts of Ukrainian forces near Donetsk. Russia is probably in the advanced planning stages to hold a referendum for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) to join Russia, according to British intelligence. On 11 August, Russian media reported that the Moscow-installed administrative head, Denis Pushilin, said that the date of a referendum on the DPR joining Russia would be announced after the DPR’s “complete liberation”. However, it is unclear if the final decision to go ahead with a vote has yet been taken, the UK’s Ministry of Defence reports. Mykolaiv came under sustained overnight fire from Russian forces, a Ukrainian official has said. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, posted on his Telegram account that an educational facility and hotel had been struck on the outskirts of the city. He added there were no casualties. The defence team of US basketball star Brittney Griner has appealed against her conviction for drugs possession and trafficking, Griner’s lawyer Maria Blagovolina told Reuters on Monday. Griner, who had played for a Russian club, was arrested at a Moscow airport on 17 February after cannabis-infused vape cartridges were found in her luggage. She pleaded guilty to the charges but said she had made an “honest mistake” by entering Russia with cannabis oil, which is illegal in the country. She was convicted on 4 August and jailed for nine years. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, says Russia and North Korea will expand bilateral relations, Pyongyang’s state media reported on Monday. Putin told North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that the two countries would “expand the comprehensive and constructive bilateral relations with common efforts”, Pyongyang’s state media reported on Monday. In a letter to Kim for North Korea’s liberation day, Putin said that closer ties would be in both countries’ interests, and would help strengthen the security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the north-eastern Asian region, North Korea’s KCNA news agency said. The first UN ship to carry Ukrainian grain for Africa is ready to depart with 23,000 tonnes of wheat. The MV Brave Commander will head to Africa and “Ethiopia will be the last country where the 23,000-tonne cargo of wheat will be delivered”, said Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov. It will be the first shipment of food aid since Kyiv and Moscow agreed a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey in July to unblock Black Sea grain deliveries. The first ship to depart Ukraine when grain exports resumed was approaching the Syrian port of Tartus on Sunday. The ship left Ukraine two weeks ago but cargo on the Razoni was refused by its original Lebanese buyer, two shipping sources told Reuters. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his forces will target Russian soldiers who shoot at or from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. “Every Russian soldier who either shoots at the plant, or shoots using the plant as cover, must understand that he becomes a special target for our intelligence agents, for our special services, for our army,” he said. A total of 42 countries have called on Russia to immediately withdraw military forces from the plant, including the US, Japan and the UK, plus the EU. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned of a possible nuclear disaster unless fighting stops. Zelenskiy has warned those with Russian citizenship against being complicit and silent in supporting Putin’s war on Ukraine. “People’s silence approaches the level of complicity. And the rejection of the real fight against evil becomes the assistance to it. Therefore, if you have Russian citizenship and you are silent, it means that you are not fighting, it means that you are supporting it,” he said in his latest national address. Ukraine’s forces continued to strike at strategic bridges supplying Russian troops holding the city of Kherson, the only major site held by the invaders on the west bank of the Dnieper, including the Antonovsky road bridge and the crossing at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant upstream. Ukraine said Russian troops who crossed the Dnieper River during their offensive in the southern region were facing growing difficulties after bridges were damaged. Russia says it has taken control of Udy, a village in the eastern Kharkiv region, according to its latest military briefing. The village has been under heavy shelling by Russian forces. Russia’s priority over the past week has likely been to reorient units to strengthen its campaign in southern Ukraine, British military intelligence said on Sunday. The UK Ministry of Defence said Russia also appeared to be intensifying attacks on the eastern Donbas front, in what is likely to be an attempt to ensure Ukraine is not able to concentrate forces in the south against Kherson. Countries throughout Europe have called for the EU to limit or block short-term Schengen visas for Russian citizens. Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Finland and the Czech Republic all urged new restrictions. Poland is also considering restrictions for Russian tourist visas. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has published its latest map showing Russian military attack and troop locations in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to target Russian troops at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant who fire on Ukrainian towns and cities. In a video statement on Saturday evening, Ukraine’s president said: Every Russian soldier who either shoots at the station or shoots under the cover of the station must understand that they are becoming a special target for our intelligence, for our special services, for our army. Both Ukraine and Russia have accused one another of shelling the nuclear plant, which is the largest in Europe, following multiple incidents in recent weeks. Russian troops captured the station early in the war. G7 nations have called on Moscow to withdraw from the plant to avoid risking nuclear catastrophe. The defence team of US basketball star Brittney Griner has appealed against her conviction for narcotics possession and trafficking, Griner’s lawyer Maria Blagovolina told Reuters on Monday. Griner, who had played for a Russian club, was arrested at a Moscow airport on 17 February after cannabis-infused vape cartridges were found in her luggage. She pleaded guilty to the charges but said she had made an “honest mistake” by entering Russia with cannabis oil, which is illegal in the country. She was convicted on 4 August and jailed for nine years. The US government says Griner was wrongfully detained. It has offered to exchange her for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year prison sentence in the US.

Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, posted on his Telegram account that an educational facility and hotel had been struck on the outskirts of the city. He added there were no casualties. The report could not been independently verified. Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer report: “A city with a Russian history,” proclaim billboards across the Ukrainian city of Kherson, occupied by the Russian army since the first days of March. Others display the Russian flag, or quotes from Vladimir Putin. Over the past five months, Moscow has appointed an occupation administration to run the Kherson region and ordered schools to teach the Russian curriculum. Local people are encouraged to apply for Russian passports to access pensions and other benefits. The next stage of the Kremlin’s plan is a referendum, to add a dubious sense of legality to these facts on the ground, and create a pretext for bringing Kherson and other occupied parts of southern Ukraine into Russia, using an updated version of the 2014 Crimea playbook. In a series of telephone interviews, people in Kherson reported minimal enthusiasm for a referendum, and described a nervous, unpredictable atmosphere in the city. Residents remain unsure about what the next few months might bring: a swift Ukrainian counteroffensive to regain control, a protracted battle that turns the city to rubble, or Russia carrying out its sham referendum and annexing the territory. Read more here: ‘A referendum is not right’: occupied Kherson looks to uncertain future These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent is reporting that Russian forces shelled Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine, overnight and hit a factory. No further information was given about possible casualties. Simon Tisdall argues locking up Vladimir Putin is a strategic aim the west should pursue: The west’s strategic aims in Ukraine – to repulse Russia’s invasion, restore national sovereignty and score a victory for global democracy over “the forces of darkness” – were clearly set out by US president Joe Biden in Warsaw in March and subsequently endorsed by UK and European leaders. What has always been less clear is whether they honestly expect to achieve these aims, given Nato’s less than heroic refusal to get directly involved. An uncomfortable, even distressing question now arises: should Ukrainians prepare for a stab in the back this winter? Nearly six months into the war, the widening gap between rhetoric and reality grows potentially fatal. Public outrage over the invasion is giving way to concern, bordering on panic, about its alarming knock-on effects on energy and food prices and the cost of living. That in turn is feeding doubts about western staying power. How long before Europe’s already shaky unity crumbles, if and when Russia’s gas tap is finally turned off? Read more of Simon Tisdall’s piece here: As Putin’s war spreads panic across Europe, Ukrainians must fear a stab in the back Russian troops are using Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, as cover to fire missiles into Ukraine-held territory. Guardian foreign correspondent Luke Harding talks to residents and Ukrainian military officials, who say they cannot retaliate. The Philippines is looking to buy heavy-lift Chinook helicopters from the US, after scrapping a deal with Russia worth 12.7bn pesos ($227.35m) in order to avoid sanctions, Manila’s ambassador to Washington said on Monday. In June, days before President Rodrigo Duterte ended his six-year term, the Philippines scrapped a deal to buy 16 Mi-17 Russian military transport helicopters because of fears of US sanctions linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reports Reuters. Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez told journalists in a virtual forum. This cancellation of this contract is precipitated mainly by the war in Ukraine. While there are sanctions expected to come our way, from the United States and western countries, obviously it is not in our interest to continue and pursue this contract. Romualdez said the Chinooks would replace existing hardware used for the movement of troops and in disaster preparedness in the Southeast Asian country. The US is willing to strike a deal for the amount the Philippines was set to spend on the Russian helicopters, Romualdez said, adding the deal with Washington will likely include maintenance, service and parts. The Philippines is pursuing discussions with Russia to recover its $38m down payment for the helicopters, the delivery of which was supposed to start in November next year, or 24 months after the contract was signed. Rustem Umerov, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, posted a picture of the Canadian military on Twitter and thanked them for helping train members of the Ukrainian armed forces. Another six ships have received permission to pass through the maritime humanitarian corridor in the Black Sea, according to a statement released by the UN-backed Joint Coordination Centre (JCC). Two of the vessels, MV Kafkam Etler and MV Zelek Star, have reportedly already passed inspection in the Sea of Marmara and can go to Chornomorsk, Odesa, for loading. The inspection of the remaining four vessels – MV Great Arsenal, MV Zumrut Ana, MV Ocean S, MV Kubrosliy – is scheduled for Tuesday. If the inspection is successful, the ships are set to go to Chornomorsk, according to Ukrainian media reports. The shipments are part of a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey with Kyiv and Moscow in July to unblock Black Sea grain deliveries. Russian proxies are continuing to consolidate administrative control of occupied areas by enforcing payments in rubles, according to a recent report from the institute for the study of war. The US thinktank cited Ukraine’s main intelligence directorate (GUR) as saying that Moscow-installed authorities in the occupied city of Kherson are pressuring local ambulance workers to sign forms consenting to work for the new occupation government and receive payments in rubles. Russian occupation authorities are also reportedly continuing to collect personal passport data from recipients of humanitarian aid, civilians who contact the occupying forces’ government, and customers of Russian mobile phone services. Russia is probably in the advanced planning stages to hold a referendum for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) to join Russia, according to British intelligence. On 11 August, Russian media reported that the Moscow-installed administrative head, Denis Pushilin, said that the date of a referendum on the DPR joining Russia would be announced after the DPR’s “complete liberation”.

Ukraine’s military command said on Sunday that Russian soldiers had continued unsuccessfully to attack Ukrainian positions near Avdiivka, which, since 2014, has become one of the outposts of Ukrainian forces near Donetsk. Ukraine’s military command said “fierce fighting” had continued in Pisky, an eastern village that Russia had earlier in the day said it had under full control. “The occupiers are trying to break through the defence of our troops in the directions of Oleksandropol, Krasnohorivka, Avdiivka, Maryinka, and Pisky,” Ukraine’s general staff said in its nightly briefing. “Fierce fighting continues.” Oleg Zhdanov, a Ukrainian military expert, said the situation was particularly difficult in Avdiivka and nearby towns, such as Pisky. “We have insufficient artillery power in place and our forces are asking for more support to defend Pisky,” he said in a video posted online. “But the town is basically under Ukrainian control.” The Guardian could not immediately independently verify the battlefield accounts. Our Wellington-based correspondent, Eva Corlett, brings us this report from New Zealand. The island nation will send another 120 troops to the UK to help train Ukrainian soldiers to defend the country against Russia’s “unjustified invasion”, in its latest show of solidarity. At a press conference on Monday, Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand prime minister, said the extra defence force personnel would take over from 30 New Zealand soldiers deployed in May. It forms part of a wider measures to support Ukraine, including more than NZD$40m in financial support and the sanctioning of 840 people and entities. Ardern said the deployment would enable two teams to train Ukrainian personnel in frontline combat including weapon handling, first aid and operational law. The latest deployment brought the total number of personnel sent to support Ukraine in the war to 224 – comparable to partner nations like Denmark (130) and Sweden (120), Ardern said. We know that one of the highest priorities for Ukraine right now, is to train its soldiers, and New Zealand is proud to stand in solidarity alongside a number of other countries to answer that call.” Training will be conducted exclusively on UK soil until late November, and New Zealand troops will not enter Ukraine. Ardern was pressed on whether she would take up President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s offer to visit Ukraine in person, but said she had no plans to do so. A total of 42 countries have called on Russia to immediately withdraw military forces from Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, including the US, Japan and the UK, plus the EU. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) warned of a possible nuclear disaster unless fighting stops. The statement called the deployment of Russian military personnel and weaponry at the nuclear facility unacceptable in that it “disregards the safety, security, and safeguards principles that all members of the IAEA have committed to respect”. The presence of Russian military forces at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant prevents the operator and the Ukrainian authorities from fulfilling their nuclear and radiation safety obligations in accordance with international conventions and IAEA safety standards, and prevents the IAEA from fulfilling its safeguards mandate. We urge the Russian Federation to immediately withdraw its military forces and all other unauthorised personnel from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, its immediate surroundings, and all of Ukraine so that the operator and the Ukrainian authorities can resume their sovereign responsibilities within Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders and the legitimate operating staff can conduct their duties without outside interference, threat, or unacceptably harsh working conditions.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said his forces will target Russian soldiers who shoot at or from Europe’s largest nuclear power station, amid warnings that the Kremlin may falsely claim Kyiv has directly hit the critical site. Zelenskiy said anyone giving orders for attacks on the site or nearby towns and cities should face trial by an international court, as concern about the safety of the nuclear site remained high. “Every Russian soldier who either shoots at the plant, or shoots using the plant as cover, must understand that he becomes a special target for our intelligence agents, for our special services, for our army,” Zelenskiy said in a video address. He called for new sanctions against Russia that would “necessarily block the Russian nuclear industry”, and he argued that “absolutely all officials of the terrorist state, as well as those who help them in this blackmail operation with the nuclear power plant, must be tried by an international court”. The Russian ambassador in Kabul has said working with the Taliban is necessary where it is in the interests of Moscow. The Taliban, no matter how you treat them, is a reality that cannot be avoided. Therefore, we must work with them where it suits our interests and where it is required to solve the tasks facing Russia,” Dmitry Zhirnov said in an interview with RIA Novosti. Talks were set to begin in Moscow between a delegation of the Afghan ministry of industry and trade sent by the Taliban government and Russian partners, Zhirnov added. Kabul also planned to discuss the supply of oil, grain, sunflower oil. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has said Russia and North Korea will expand bilateral relations, Pyongyang’s state news agency, the KCNA, reported on Monday. Putin told the North Korean ruler, Kim Jong-un, that the two countries would “expand the comprehensive and constructive bilateral relations with common efforts”, the KCNA reported on Monday. In a letter to Kim for North Korea’s liberation day, Putin said closer ties would be in both countries’ interests, and would help strengthen the security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the north-eastern Asian region, the KCNA said. Kim also reportedly sent a letter to Putin saying Russian-North Korean friendship had been forged in the second world war with victory over Japan. Their “strategic and tactical cooperation, support and solidarity” had since reached a new level in their common efforts to frustrate threats and provocations from hostile military forces, Kim said in the letter, as reported by Reuters. KCNA did not identify the hostile forces, but it has typically used that term to refer to the US and its allies. Kim predicted cooperation between Russia and North Korea would grow based on an agreement signed in 2019 when he met with Putin. North Korea in July recognised two Russian-occupied “people’s republics” in eastern Ukraine as independent states, and officials raised the prospect of North Korean workers being sent to the areas to help in construction and other labour. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while.

Saudi Arabia’s largely state-owned energy firm recorded one of the largest quarterly profits in history, highlighting the colossal profits made by gas and oil-rich nations during the energy crisis linked to the war in Ukraine. Saudi Aramco profits in the three months to the end of June were up 90% to $48bn (£40bn) to beat the near $26bn it made a year earlier. Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding invested in Russian energy groups Gazprom, Rosneft and Lukoil between 22 February and 22 March, it said on Twitter on Sunday.

Many people do. Unsurprisingly, livestock farmers are often furiously opposed. More surprisingly, so are some vegans: “Why can’t people eat tofu and lentils, like me?” Well, the new products – plant-based, microbial and cell-cultured meat and dairy – are not aimed at vegans, but at the far greater number who like the taste and texture of animals. Many others instinctively recoil from the idea of food that seems familiar, but isn’t. So here’s a question for all the sceptics. What do you intend to do about the soaring global demand for animal products, and its devastating impacts? Already, 60% of the mammals on Earth by weight are livestock. Humans account for 36%, wild mammals for just 4%. Of birds, poultry make up 71%, wild species only 29%. While the human population is growing at 1% a year, the livestock population is growing at 2.4%. Global average meat consumption per person is 43kg a year, but swiftly heading towards the UK level of 82kg. The reason is Bennett’s Law: as people become richer, they eat more protein and fat, especially the flesh and secretions of animals. So, if you don’t like the new technologies, what solution do you propose? I keep asking, and the response is either furious or evasive. “It’s the wrong question!” “Who’s paying you?” “Do you want us to eat slime?” So far, only one of the people I’ve asked has answered it directly: the food campaigner Vandana Shiva. “You blindly echo the myth that as people get richer they eat more meat. Indians continue to be vegetarians even when they become rich. Food cultures are shaped by cultural and ecological values.” But meat-eating in India is rising rapidly, though many people do it secretly. In other words, despite religious proscriptions, enforced with vigilantism and, in some cases, murder, Bennett’s Law still applies. It’s as if we were urging people to burn less fossil fuel without offering a replacement: no solar, wind, geothermal or nuclear power. This issue is just as urgent, arguably even more so, as livestock farming attacks every Earth system. It’s the primary agent of habitat destruction and wildlife loss. It’s causing rivercide and dead zones at sea. It generates more greenhouse gas emissions than all the world’s transport. It sprawls across vast tracts of the planet, inflicting massive carbon and ecological opportunity costs. Both historically and currently, livestock farming is probably the world’s most powerful agent of colonial land grabbing and the displacement of Indigenous people. Meat is consuming the planet. Substitutes for animal products can greatly reduce this damage. They can allow vast areas to be returned to dispossessed people and the ecosystems they defended. The first cell-cultured meat recently gained regulatory approval in the United States. At the same time, the taste and texture of plant-based alternatives has greatly improved. I’ve recently eaten three products that are almost indistinguishable from the originals: a steak made by a Slovenian company called Juicy Marbles, a “lamb” fillet from the Israeli company Redefine Meat, and sushi and tempura “seafood” at the London restaurant 123V. In response, Big Meat has ramped up its campaign of demonisation. That’s understandable. Less so is the support the animal industry receives from people who claim to be green, but happily recite its misleading propaganda. The professor of food and agricultural policy Robert Paarlberg compares this alliance to the inadvertent coalition of Baptists and bootleggers in the US a century ago. By lobbying successfully for the prohibition of alcohol, the Southern Baptists opened the door to gangsters trading in stronger and more dangerous drink. True environmentalists have a duty to break this ultra-conservative consensus. Adoption of the new technologies is likely to follow an S-curve: slow, then sudden. At first, uptake will be low and will suffer repeated setbacks. But as scale rises and prices fall, market penetration is likely to reach 10% or more. That’s the point at which linear growth suddenly switches to exponential growth. It’s a trend we’ve seen in dozens of technologies, from refrigerators to smartphones. The biggest hurdles will be political. As governments are pressurised by Big Meat, they will raise the kind of obstacles that, in the UK and US, have delayed the rollout of renewable electricity. The UK government, for example, is reported to be considering a ban on calling plant-based products “milk” and “butter”. What it will do about coconut milk and peanut butter is anyone’s guess. No VAT is charged on meat and milk here, but most plant-based alternatives must pay 20%. The regulators that might approve the new products are often overwhelmed. Brexit has dumped a massive workload on the UK’s Food Standards Agency and its budget falls far short of what it needs. At the same time, it has been flooded with applications for CBD (cannabidiol) products: it could be years before it can assess alternative proteins. None of these questions should be left to industry and government. Environmental campaigners should be working not to destroy the green alternatives but to ensure they are regulated properly and, through effective anti-trust laws, do not become as concentrated in the hands of a few corporations as the meat trade is. As always, this will be a political struggle as much as a technological one. And we need to decide which team we are on.

Here’s where we stand: Finland will become the 31st member of the world’s biggest military alliance on Tuesday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. Stoltenberg said Turkey, the last country to ratify Finland’s membership, would hand its official texts to the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Tuesday. Stoltenberg said he would then invite Finland to do the same. Stoltenberg’s announcement prompted a warning from Russia that it would bolster its defences near their joint border if Nato deployed any troops inside the country. “We will strengthen our military potential in the west and in the north-west,” Grushko said in remarks carried by the RIA Novosti state news agency. Ukraine’s western allies have sent the country €65bn (£57bn) in military aid to help in its fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion, Stoltenberg said. He was speaking as Nato foreign ministers prepare to meet in Brussels on Tuesday to “discuss how we can step up our support, including by continuing to strengthen Ukraine’s armed forces”. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has paid tribute to the courage of nearly 400 villagers in north Ukraine who were held in a school basement under Russian occupation for 27 days before they were set free a year ago. The Ukrainian leader travelled to Yahidne on Monday, where he gave an emotive speech recalling how villagers were kept captive in a space of less than 200 sq metres during the first month of Russia’s February 2022 invasion. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, will visit the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on Wednesday, an IAEA spokesperson said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is scheduled to visit Poland on Wednesday for talks with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. Zelenskiy will be accompanied by his wife, Olena Zelenska, during his first official visit to Warsaw since Russia’s invasion 13 months ago. Zelenskiy is also expected to hold talks with Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. Poland has already delivered the first batch of Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, according to the Polish presidential office’s head of international policy, Marcin Przydacz. He did not specify how many jets had been transferred. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, last month said Warsaw would hand over the first four MiG-29 to Ukraine. Ukraine has said Russian forces are “very far” from capturing the eastern town of Bakhmut and that fighting raged around the city administration building where the Wagner mercenary group claims to have raised the Russian flag. “Bakhmut is Ukrainian, and they have not captured anything and are very far from doing that to put it mildly,” Serhiy Cherevatiy, a spokesperson for the eastern military command said. President Zelenskiy has said overnight the fighting in Bakhmut is “especially hot”. His comments came as the Wagner founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his troops had raised a Russian flag on the city’s administrative building. However, there was no indication from Ukrainian officials that Bakhmut had fallen into Russian hands and Prigozhin has previously made premature claims about Wagner’s military progress in the city. Russian police have arrested a woman suspected of delivering a bomb that killed a prominent pro-war Russian military blogger in a blast in a cafe in central St Petersburg on Sunday. Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed by a bomb blast as he hosted a discussion with other pro-war commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of the city. Police said they had identified a woman called Darya Trepova as the suspect and that she was arrested in a flat in St Petersburg after a search on Monday morning. Evan Gershkovich, the US journalist arrested on espionage charges in Russia last week, has appealed against his detention through his lawyers, according to a report. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Gershkovich’s arrest was “of concern” and called for his “immediate release”. The US government is “pushing hard” for the release of Evan Gershkovich, the White House said on Monday. Many people could have wanted to kill Vladlen Tatarsky, the pro-war Russian blogger who died in a bomb blast in a St Petersburg cafe on Sunday. Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, was notorious for his vehement support for the invasion of Ukraine, where he regularly called for Russia to commit to a total war and advocated for extreme violence that included war crimes. “We’ll defeat everyone, we’ll kill everyone, we’ll loot whoever we need to, and everything will be just as we like it,” he said last year on camera after a Kremlin ceremony confirming the “annexation” of four Ukrainian regions. A former coalminer from east Ukraine, Fomin was convicted of bank robbery and was serving a prison sentence in east Ukraine when Russian proxy forces launched their war against the government. Fomin claimed he then fled custody and joined the Russian-backed forces. Later, he became a blogger and moved to Moscow several years before Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022. After the war began, he claimed to have joined a volunteer battalion and fought in Mariupol. At the beginning of the war he became a member of a small but influential group of military bloggers who have been vocally supportive of the conflict, regularly posting updates citing troops on the frontlines or dangling scoops about potential offensives or big political decisions such as mobilisations. At the same time, they have also been some of the most virulent critics of Russia’s military effort, condemning the army’s top brass as ineffective and lazy, and uncaring for the lives of Russian troops sent into battle. Read the full story here: The German arms maker Rheinmetall is building a military maintenance and logistics hub in Satu Mare, Romania, that is expected to begin operation this month to service weapons used for the war in Ukraine, the company has said. The hub, located near the Ukrainian border, will service self-propelled howitzers, Leopard 2 and Challenger tanks, Marder infantry fighting vehicles, Fuchs armoured transport vehicles and military trucks, it said. A Rheinmetall spokesperson said on Sunday: The service hub should play a central role in maintaining the operational readiness of western combat systems in use in Ukraine and ensuring the availability of logistical support. The chief executive of the company, Armin Papperger, said it was a “key concern” to provide Nato forces and Ukraine “with the best possible support”. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, travelled to Romania today for talks with its president, Klaus Iohannis, that focused on security, economy and energy. They also discussed defence cooperation on Nato’s eastern flank and security in the Black Sea region. Scholz highlighted the strong relations between Germany and Romania and again promised to “give Ukraine military support for as long as it is necessary, and we are working on that constantly and together”. He did not directly answer questions on the Rheinmetall facility being set up in Romania. Iohannis and Scholz were later joined by Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, for talks on ways to support her embattled country. Moldova is Ukraine’s “most vulnerable neighbour”, Mandu told reporters, adding that “when our values are under attack, democratic countries must help each other”. Ukraine has received the first $2.7bn (£2.2bn) tranche under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) extended fund facility programme, finance minister Sergii Marchenko has said. The IMF said on Friday that its executive board had approved a four-year $15.6bn (£12.6bn) loan programme for Ukraine, part of a global $115bn (£92.8bn) package to support the country’s economy as it battles Russia’s invasion. The extended fund facility (EFF) loan is the first major conventional financing programme approved by the IMF for a country involved in a large-scale war. The decision cleared the way for the immediate disbursement of $2.7bn to Kyiv, and requires Ukraine to carry out ambitious reforms, especially in the energy sector, the Fund said in a statement. While we’re on the subject of western aid for Ukraine, the White House has said the US will send a new package of assistance to Ukraine this week. Ukraine is still fighting hard for the eastern city of Bakhmut and the battle is not over, White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. Ukraine’s western allies have sent the country €65bn (£57bn) in military aid to help the country in its fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said. “We cannot allow Russia to continue to chip away at European security,” Stoltenberg told a news conference as Nato foreign ministers prepare to meet in Brussels tomorrow to “discuss how we can step up our support, including by continuing to strengthen Ukraine’s armed forces”. Earlier we reported that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy travelled to Yahidne in northern Ukraine, where nearly 400 residents were kept captive in a school basement under Russian occupation for 27 days before they were set free a year ago. Eleven people died during the ordeal, Zelenskiy said. The Ukrainian leader was joined on the visit to the village in Chernihiv region by the German vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, and the Council of Europe secretary general, Marija Pejčinović Burić. Zelenskiy thanked Habeck and Burić for attending and said the basement was important for Ukraine’s allies to see. He said: It’s important to see this and to be in these basements to understand whether to help Ukraine or to keep thinking how to find a way to talk with Russia. Russian troops and the country’s leadership, including Vladimir Putin, were responsible for the tragedy, he said. He added: Having seen all this, I can wish the president of Russia to spend the rest of his days in a basement with a bucket for a toilet. The US government is “pushing hard” for the release of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia on espionage charges, the White House has said. National security council spokesperson, John Kirby, told reporters: We have been pushing hard since the moment we found out the reporter was detained. The US is “keenly, strongly, closely” tracking his detention, he added. The UN’s nuclear watchdog has said its head, Rafael Grossi, will travel to Russia’s Kaliningrad territory on Wednesday for talks on the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Russian news agencies had earlier reported that Grossi would visit Moscow, citing a senior diplomat. But a spokesperson for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said he would visit the Russian Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad. Grossi will visit Kaliningrad “as part of his ongoing consultations aimed at ensuring the protection of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant during the military conflict”, the IAEA spokesperson said. Grossi visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is in territory occupied by Russia since early in its invasion, last week. He said the situation had grown worse and military activity around the site had intensified in recent months. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Finland will become the 31st member of the world’s biggest military alliance on Tuesday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. Stoltenberg said Turkey, the last country to ratify Finland’s membership, would hand its official texts to the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Tuesday.

Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Gershkovich’s arrest was “of concern” and called for his “immediate release”. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, has said Moscow will strengthen its military in its western and north-western regions in response to Finland joining Nato tomorrow. He told Russian state-owned Ria news agency: In the event that the forces and resources of other Nato members are deployed in Finland, we will take additional steps to reliably ensure Russia’s military security. Finland has a 1,300km (810 mile) border with Russia, and joining Nato will roughly double the alliance’s frontier facing Moscow. Evan Gershkovich, the US journalist arrested on espionage charges in Russia last week, has appealed against his detention through his lawyers, Interfax news agency reported, citing the court. Gershkovich, 31, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, was detained on Wednesday in the Urals city of Ekaterinburg and accused by Russia’s FSB internal security agency of collecting “classified information” on a company in its military industrial complex. The WSJ says it “vehemently denies the allegations” and the White House has described the charges as “ridiculous”. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday paid tribute to the courage of nearly 400 residents of a village in north Ukraine who were held in a school basement under Russian occupation for 27 days before they were set free a year ago. The Ukrainian leader travelled to Yahidne, where he gave an emotive speech recalling how villagers were kept captive in a space of less than 200 sq metres during the first month of Russia’s February 2022 invasion. He said that 11 people died during the ordeal. “These people somehow lived and waited for Ukraine in the dark,” said Zelenskiy, who appeared visibly moved on the anniversary. “They lived standing and sitting.” Reuters reports that Zelenskiy was joined on the visit to Yahidne, a village in Chernihiv region, by the German vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, and the Council of Europe secretary general, Marija Pejčinović Burić. On his official Telegram channel, Zelenskiy wrote: I want to thank the residents of Yahidne. They endured torture, a terrible path, the path of absolute heroes. I thank Ukraine for having such fighters for life. Catherine Russell, the executive director of Unicef, the UN children’s fund, has commented on the announcement by the OHCHR Ukraine civilian casualty update team that the number of children killed in the conflict since February 2022 has risen to at least 501. She said: This is another tragic milestone for Ukraine’s children and families. Since the escalation of the war in February 2022, at least 501 children have been killed. This is just the UN-verified number. The real figure is likely far higher, and the toll on families affected is unimaginable. Almost 1,000 children have been injured, leaving them with wounds and scars – both visible and invisible – that could last for life. Children and families in Ukraine are paying the highest price for this brutal war. Behind every number is a family torn apart and changed for ever. It is heart-wrenching. War is always the worst enemy of children, whether in Ukraine, or countless other conflicts around the world. Every child, no matter where they live, deserves to grow up in a peaceful environment. Tatiana Moskalkova, commissioner for human rights in the Russian Federation, has told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass that Ukraine and Russia have swapped five injured prisoners of war in recent days. It quotes her saying: “Today, five wounded servicemen of the armed forces of Ukraine have been repatriated to Ukraine. We continue to work in this direction.” Tass reports that according to her, at the end of March, Ukraine handed over five wounded Russian soldiers who are currently being treated. “I wish them a speedy recovery and I believe that they will soon return to their families and friends, who will greet them as real heroes,” she is reported as saying. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that in the last day, in the Ukrainian-held areas of Kherson region, pyrotechnicians defused 56 explosive object in de-occupied settlements. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, will visit Russia on Wednesday, Russia’s permanent representative to international organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, told state television on Monday. Reuters reports Ulyanov said Grossi would meet a Russian delegation and that they would discuss the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, located in a Russian-occupied part of Ukraine, near the frontline of fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Russian forces captured Europe’s largest nuclear power station in March 2022, and since then have been forcing Ukrainian staff to continue to operate it. Both sides have accused the other of shelling the power plant and risking a nuclear accident. Grossi recently visited and inspected the plant for a second time since the war began. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has called for the “immediate release” of the US national Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was arrested in Russia last week. Stoltenberg, speaking at a news conference, said he joined the US in their call on Russia to release Gershkovich. He added: His arrest is of concern. It is important to respect freedom of the press, the rights of journalists, and the rights to ask questions and to do their jobs. Therefore, we call on his immediate release. Russian police have been pictured guarding the site of yesterday’s explosion in a cafe in central St Petersburg that killed the prominent pro-war Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky. Tributes have been laid near the scene of the blast, which took place as Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was hosting a discussion with other pro-war commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of the city. More than 30 people were wounded and 10 of them remain in grave condition from the explosion, according to authorities. Police have arrested a woman, Darya Trepova, whom they have identified as the suspect. Authorities claim she was a supporter of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Belarus has started combat readiness inspections of its armed forces, the defence ministry has said in a statement published on Telegram. The ministry said inspections would determine the capacity of military units to perform at “the highest levels of combat readiness”.

Nato has not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture since Vladimir Putin’s announcement that he would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Stoltenberg says. So far, we haven’t seen any changes in their nuclear posture that requires any change, changing our nuclear posture. Nato’s position on Ukraine’s bid “remains unchanged” and that is that “Ukraine will become a member of the alliance”, Stoltenberg says. The main focus however is to “ensure that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent nation in Europe”, he says. So the first and most urgent step is for Kyiv’s allies to sustain and further step up military, lethal, non-lethal and economic support to Ukraine, he says. Nato is also looking into how it can develop a political relationship with Ukraine, and how it can expand its work on more long-term reforms in institutional building, he says. It is extremely important to continue to demonstrate that Nato’s door remains open, as we’ll do tomorrow, when Finland will become a full member. As we do when we finalise the accession process for Sweden hopefully in the near future. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has been speaking at a news conference after the announcement that Finland will officially join the military alliance tomorrow. Finland joining Nato on Tuesday “will be a good day for Finland’s security, for Nordic security and for Nato as a whole”, he says. On the subject of Sweden – which applied to join Nato at the same time as Finland last May but whose membership bid is still being blocked by Turkey – Stoltenberg said the raising of Finland’s flag “is also good for Sweden”. He says he will continue to work on finalising the Swedish accession process. Finland will officially become a member of the Nato military alliance on Tuesday, the Finnish president’s office has said. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, confirmed Finland will join the alliance tomorrow. Germany’s vice chancellor, Robert Habeck, has been pictured arriving in Kyiv for talks in an unannounced visit. A spokesperson for Germany’s energy and economy ministry confirmed the visit, saying Habeck, who also serves as minister for energy and the economy, arrived in the Ukrainian capital early today. Habeck was accompanied by a small business delegation including Siegfried Russwurm, president of the federation of German industries. It is Habeck’s first visit to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion 13 months ago. Habeck said the aim of the talks was to “give Ukraine hope” that the country will be rebuilt after the war. He said the purpose of his visit was to send a clear signal to Kyiv: A signal that we believe it will be victorious, that it will be rebuilt, that there is an interest from Europe not only to support it in times of need, but that Ukraine will also be an economically strong partner in the future. Poland has already delivered the first batch of Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, according to the Polish presidential office’s head of international policy, Marcin Przydacz. Przydacz, in an interview with Polish radio RMF today, said: According to my information, this process has already been completed, i.e., the transfer of this first part. Of course, there will be talks about possible further support. He did not specify how many jets had been transferred. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, last month said Warsaw would hand over the first four MiG-29 to Ukraine. Duda said at the time: We still have a dozen of these [aircraft]. We got them in the early 1990s from the East German army. These are the last years of their operation in accordance with their technical capabilities but are still functional. Kyiv has urged its allies to provide fighter jets to defend its airspace and more effectively counterattack the Russian forces on its territory. So far, only Poland and Slovakia, which approved the transfer of 13 MiG-29 jets, have answered that call. We reported earlier that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is scheduled to visit Poland on Wednesday for talks with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. We have some more details of the visit. Zelenskiy will be accompanied by his wife, Olena Zelenska, during his first official visit to Warsaw since Russia’s invasion 13 months ago. He has held a number of secret working meetings in the country while travelling to other countries. The visit will begin with an official meeting at the royal castle between Zelenskiy and Duda, with the pair expected to discuss security issues, regional politics, and economic cooperation, as well as the transit of Ukrainian grain and other farm produce through Poland, according to Marcin Przydacz, the head of Duda’s international office. The talks with be followed by a meeting with the public, according to Duda’s office. Zelenskiy is also expected to hold talks with Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, regarding regional security, the situation at the front, and bilateral cooperation including the situation at border crossings and with Ukrainian grain, according to Morawiecki aide Michal Dworczyk. Ukraine has said Russian forces are “very far” from capturing the eastern town of Bakhmut and that fighting raged around the city administration building where the Wagner mercenary group claims to have raised the Russian flag. “Bakhmut is Ukrainian, and they have not captured anything and are very far from doing that to put it mildly,” Serhiy Cherevatiy, a spokesperson for the eastern military command said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said overnight the fighting in Bakhmut, the heavily fought over city in Ukraine’s Donbas region, is “especially hot”. His comments came as the Wagner founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his troops had raised a Russian flag on the city’s administrative building. However there was no indication from Ukrainian officials that Bakhmut had fallen into Russian hands and Prigozhin has previously made claims about Wagner’s military progress in the city that were premature. Russian police have arrested a woman suspected of delivering a bomb that killed a prominent pro-war Russian military blogger in a blast in a cafe in central St Petersburg on Sunday. Russian authorities say Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed by a bomb explosion as he was hosting a discussion with other pro-war commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of St Petersburg. Russian police said they had identified a woman called Darya Trepova as the suspect, adding that she was arrested in an apartment in St Petersburg after a search on Monday morning. Sources in the country’s interior ministry told the RBK news outlet that the attack was “carefully planned in advance by several people”. Russian tactical nuclear weapons will be moved close to Belarus’ borders with its Nato neighbours, the Russian ambassador to Belarus has said amid tensions between Russia and the west over Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that in the last 24 hours “the Russian army carried out 29 strikes on 12 populated areas of Donetsk region”. It adds “46 residential buildings, a kindergarten, an administrative building, factory workshops, power lines, gas pipelines and cars were destroyed and damaged.” The Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting an explosion in occupied Melitopol. It reports the city administration said a car was blown up in the city centre, and that one person was injured. The Telegram channel of the Russian-imposed authority in the city has named the injured person as Maxim Zubarev, the head of the occupying authority in the Yakymivka settlement in the region. Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, has arrived in Ukraine on a surprise visit, the German energy and economy ministry has said, in his first trip to the country since the outbreak of war. Poland’s president has said he expects Zelenskiy, to visit on 5 April. The visit would coincide with the next summit of Nato foreign ministers, which is taking place in Brussels, and which the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is expected to attend. Russia’s security forces are confiscating the passports of senior officials and state company executives due to paranoia over potential leaks and defections, the Financial Times is reporting. Russia plans to form a division of special-purpose submarines that will carry Poseidon nuclear-capable torpedoes as part of the country’s Pacific Fleet by the end of 2024 or first half of 2025, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported. Our video team have also put together this report on the death of Vladlen Tatarsky at the weekend. Pjotr Sauer rounds up the latest developments after Sunday’s St Petersburg café explosion: Russian police have arrested a woman suspected of delivering a bomb that killed a prominent pro-war Russian military blogger in a blast in a cafe in central St Petersburg on Sunday. Russian authorities say Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed by a bomb blast as he was hosting a discussion with other pro-war commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of St Petersburg. Russian news reports said the bomb was hidden in a bust of the blogger that the suspect had given to him as a gift moments before the explosion, which also wounded more than 30 people. Russian police said they had identified a woman called Darya Trepova as the suspect, adding that she was arrested in an apartment in St Petersburg following a search on Monday morning. Sources in the country’s interior ministry told the RBK news outlet that the attack was “carefully planned in advance by several people”. Tatarsky, who had more than 560,000 followers on Telegram, was one of the country’s most influential military bloggers. He emerged as one of the loudest critics of Russia’s defence ministry over the last year for its inability to achieve military gains in Ukraine, and frequently travelled with Russian troops on the frontlines. In one instance he called for a tribunal for the Russian military leadership, describing Moscow’s top officers as “untrained idiots”. He was also among the attendees at a Kremlin ceremony last September where Vladimir Putin proclaimed Russia’s annexation of four partly occupied regions of Ukraine, a move widely condemned by the international community.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said overnight the fighting in Bakhmut, the heavily fought over city in Ukraine’s Donbas region, is “especially hot”. “I am grateful to our warriors who are fighting near Avdiivka, Maryinka, near Bakhmut … Especially Bakhmut! It’s especially hot there today!” he said in his nightly address without elaborating further. His comments came as Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said his troops had raised a Russian flag on the city’s administrative building. However there was no indication from Ukrainian officials that Bakhmut had fallen into Russian hands and Prigozhin has previously made claims about Wagner’s military progress in the city that were premature. Russian forces have for months been trying to encircle and capture Bakhmut, a town of 70,000 before the Russian invasion launched over a year ago. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that in the last 24 hours “the Russian army carried out 29 strikes on 12 populated areas of Donetsk region”. It adds “46 residential buildings, a kindergarten, an administrative building, factory workshops, power lines, gas pipelines and cars were destroyed and damaged.” The claims have not been independently verified. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports that the suspect in the explosion that killed military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky has been detained by the authorities. She has been named as Daria Trepova. Tass quotes a statement from employees of the investigative committee which says: On suspicion of involvement in the explosion in a cafe in St Petersburg, employees of the Russian investigative committee, together with operational services, detained Daria Trepova. Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, had more than 560,000 followers on Telegram and was one of the country’s most influential military bloggers. More than 30 people were wounded in the blast on Sunday. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that in the last 24 hours, Russian forces have shelled 16 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region. Zaporizhzhia is one of the partially occupied areas of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Russia’s interior ministry on Monday named a woman called Darya Trepova as a suspect in the killing of prominent war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in a St Petersburg cafe and placed her on its wanted list, Reuters reports, citing Interfax. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting an explosion in occupied Melitopol. It reports the city administration said a car was blown up in the city centre, and that one person was injured. The Telegram channel of the Russian-imposed authority in the city has named the injured person as Maxim Zubarev, the head of the occupying authority in the Yakymivka settlement in the region. This is unconfirmed. Video circulating on social media appears to show a damaged car in the street. The claims have not been independently verified. Reuters has a quick snap to say that Poland’s president has said he expects Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to visit on 5 April. The visit would coincide with the next summit of Nato foreign ministers, which is taking place in Brussels, and which the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is expected to attend. Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, has arrived in Ukraine on a surprise visit, the German energy and economy ministry has said, in his first trip to the country since the outbreak of war. A spokesperson for the ministry confirmed the visit, saying Habeck, who also serves as minister for energy and the economy, arrived in Kyiv early on Monday. The spokesperson did not give further details to Reuters, citing security precautions. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. In case you missed it, the Guardian reporters Shaun Walker, Pjotr Sauer and Tom Phillips have the story of a pair of highly unusual Russian spies who left emotional devastation in their wake when they fled back to Russia earlier this year, amid fears they were about to be unmasked. Gerhard Daniel Campos Wittich managed 3D printing companies in Brazil, which among other things produced novelty resin sculptures for the Brazilian military and sausage dog key chains. His alleged wife, Irina Romanova, posed as a Greek-Mexican photographer named Maria Tsalla and ran a knitting supplies shop in Athens. Here’s an excerpt: Illegals often work in pairs as married couples, but the case of Campos Wittich and Tsalla is the first alleged example of two halves of an illegal couple working in separate countries with separate lives. “We have very little doubt that they were married,” said the Greek official, adding that it was an unusual case. He claimed that the pair had engineered meetings in Greece, Cyprus and France in recent times, possibly romantic encounters mixed with espionage catch-ups. Interviews in Greece and Brazil suggest both halves of the couple left emotional devastation in the wake of their hurried departures. Both had long-term romantic partners in their cover identities, who had no suspicion they were involved with Russian spies. Campos Wittich lived for at least two years in Rio with his Brazilian girlfriend, who coordinated the social media search for him when he disappeared. She is a veterinarian who works for the country’s ministry of agriculture. Read on here: Russia plans to form a division of special-purpose submarines that will carry Poseidon nuclear-capable torpedoes as part of the country’s Pacific Fleet by the end of 2024 or first half of 2025, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported. Russia said in January that it had produced the first set of the Poseidon torpedoes, four years after president Vladimir Putin announced the fundamentally new type of strategic nuclear weapon, confirming it would have its own nuclear power supply, according to Reuters. In late March, Russia said that the coastal infrastructure for the submarines that would carry the Poseidon torpedoes will be finished on the Kamchatka Peninsula, where Russia’s Pacific Fleet’s ballistic nuclear missile submarine base is located. “The decision to form a division of special-purpose nuclear submarines in Kamchatka has been made,” Tass cited an unidentified defence source as saying. “We are talking about December 2024 or the first half of 2025.” There are few confirmed details about the Poseidon in the public domain, but military analysts say it is essentially a cross between a torpedo and a drone which can be launched from a nuclear submarine. Russia’s security forces are confiscating the passports of senior officials and state company executives due to paranoia over potential leaks and defections, the Financial Times is reporting. Citing several people familiar with the matter, the paper’s Moscow bureau chief Max Seddon writes in a paywalled report: The increased pressure reflects deep suspicion in the Kremlin and FSB, the KGB’s successor agency, about the loyalty of Russia’s civilian elite, many of whom privately oppose the war in Ukraine and are chafing over its impact on their lifestyles. A spokesperson for Putin confirmed that Russia had tightened its restrictions on foreign travel for some people workers in “sensitive” areas. The assassination of prominent pro-war Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, may reveal further fractures within the Kremlin and its inner circle, the US-based Institute for the Study of War has written in its daily analysis. The Russian Foreign Ministry blamed Kyiv for the attack – which took place in a St Petersburg cafe reportedly belonging to Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin – and praised Russian military bloggers for their war coverage, “seemingly ignoring the fact that Fomin and other milbloggers routinely criticize the Russian Ministry of Defense and the Russian Foreign Ministry,” ISW analysts wrote. They also noted that Prigozhin stated on 2 April that he would not “blame the Kyiv regime” for the deaths of Fomin and Russian ultranationalist figure Daria Dugina, who was assassinated in August, suggesting that Ukrainian agents were not in fact responsible. The ISW continued: Fomin’s assassination at Prigozhin’s bar is likely part of a larger pattern of escalating Russian internal conflicts involving Prigozhin and Wagner. Fomin had attended another event earlier in the day without incident, so it appears that the attack was deliberately staged in a space owned by Prigozhin. Advisor to Ukrainian Presidential Office Mykhailo Podolyak stated that Fomin’s death was a result of antifighting and political competition among Russian actors. Some Russian political analysts also speculated that Prigozhin was supposed to attend Fomin’s event, although there is no confirmation of that speculation. Fomin’s assassination may have been intended as a warning to Prigozhin, who has been increasingly questioning core Kremlin talking points about the war in Ukraine and even obliquely signaling an interest in the Russian presidency, whether in competition with Putin or as his successor.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the fighting in Bakhmut, the heavily fought over city in Ukraine’s Donbas region, is “especially hot”. “I am grateful to our warriors who are fighting near Avdiivka, Maryinka, near Bakhmut... Especially Bakhmut! It’s especially hot there today!” he said in his nightly address without elaborating further. His comments came as Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said his troops had raised a Russian flag on the city’s administrative building, according to Reuters. However there was no indication from Ukrainian officials that Bakhmut had fallen into Russian hands and Prigozhin has previously made claims about Wagner’s military progress in the city that were premature. Russian forces have for months been trying to encircle and capture Bakhmut, a town of 70,000 before the Russian invasion launched over a year ago. Prigozhin, in an audio message posted on his press service’s Telegram account, said: From a legal point of view, Bakhmut has been taken. The enemy is concentrated in the western parts.” A senior Ukrainian official had earlier described the situation around the town as “tense,” with the military command carefully considering every move. Deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces were continuing to defend their positions, with Russian forces paying scant attention to their losses as they mounted attacks. The situation in Bakhmut remains tense,” Maliar said on Telegram. “But every military decision and every step is weighed carefully ... We respond to the prevailing situation appropriately, taking into account all circumstances, tasks and the principle of military feasibility.” Zelenskiy and military commanders agreed last month to maintain the defence of Bakhmut amid public debate over whether it was best to remain or adopt other defensive positions. Russian tactical nuclear weapons will be moved close to Belarus’ borders with its Nato neighbours, the Russian ambassador to Belarus has said amid tensions between Russia and the west over Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Associated Press reports: Ambassador Boris Gryzlov’s comment followed Russian president Vladimir Putin’s recent statement about plans to station tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Russia’s neighbour and ally. The announcement marked another attempt by the Russian leader to dangle the nuclear threat to discourage the west from supporting Ukraine. Putin has said that construction of storage facilities for tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus will be complete by 1 July and added that Russia has helped modernise Belarusian warplanes to make them capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The two neighbours have an agreement envisioning close economic, political and military ties. Russia used Belarusian territory as a staging ground for invading Ukraine and has maintained a contingent of troops and weapons there. Gryzlov, speaking in remarks broadcast late Sunday by Belarusian state television, said the Russian nuclear weapons will be “moved up close to the western border of our union state” but did not give any precise location. “It will expand our defence capability, and it will be done regardless of all the noise in Europe and the United States,” he said in a reference to western criticism of Putin’s decision. Belarus shares a 1,250-kilometre border with Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Tactical nuclear weapons, which are intended to destroy enemy troops and weapons on the battlefield, have a relatively short range and a much lower yield compared with nuclear warheads fitted to long-range strategic missiles that are capable of obliterating whole cities. The deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus would put them closer to potential targets in Ukraine and Nato members in Eastern and Central Europe. Belarus’ authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko said Friday that some of Russia’s strategic nuclear weapons might be deployed to Belarus along with part of Russia’s tactical nuclear arsenal. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Livingstone and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments as they happen. Our top story this morning: Russia’s ambassador to Belarus says Moscow will deploy tactical nuclear weapons close to Belarus’s border with Nato neighbours Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The comment follows Russian president Vladimir Putin’s recent statement about plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. The weapons “will be moved to the western border of our union state and will increase the possibilities to ensure security”, Boris Gryzlov told Belarusian state television. “This will be done despite the noise in Europe and the United States.” We’ll have more on this stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Prominent pro-war Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky has been killed in a blast at a cafe in central St Petersburg, Russia’s interior ministry has said. Russian media said a bomb was hidden in a statue presented to Tatarsky in a box as a gift. Another 30 people were injured. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has called for Russia to free the detained American journalist Evan Gershkovich in a rare phone call with his Moscow counterpart. The American’s plea was rejected by Sergei Lavrov, who responded by saying that US officials and media outlets must “not make a fuss” or try to politicise the plight of the Wall Street Journal reporter. More than three dozen editors of news organisations from across the world have signed a letter condemning Gershkovich’s detention. “Russia is sending the message that journalism within your borders is criminalized and that foreign correspondents seeking to report from Russia do not enjoy the benefits of the rule of law,” says the letter. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the heavily fought over city of Bakhmut is “especially hot” right now. The comment, in his regular evening address, came as the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said that his forces had raised the Russian flag over Bakhmut’s administration building. Prigozhin has issued some premature success claims before and the Guardian could not verify his claim. Saudi Arabia and other Opec+ oil producers including Russia have announced further cuts in their production amounting to around 1.16 million barrels per day in a surprise move that analysts said would cause an immediate rise in prices. Russia has suffered up to 200,000 casualties in the war in Ukraine but a “significant number” of these are due to “non-combat causes”, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. “Other leading causes of non-combat casualties likely include poor weapon handing drills, road traffic accidents and climatic injuries such as hypothermia,” it said. Russia plans to form a division of special-purpose submarines that will carry Poseidon nuclear-capable torpedoes as part of the country’s Pacific Fleet by the end of 2024 or first half of 2025, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/extended-visa-scheme-ukrainians-join-family-in-uk-russia-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T19:39:55Z","webTitle":"Extended visa scheme launched to let Ukrainians join family in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/extended-visa-scheme-ukrainians-join-family-in-uk-russia-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/extended-visa-scheme-ukrainians-join-family-in-uk-russia-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Extended visa scheme launched to let Ukrainians join family in UK","bodyText":"An extended visa scheme to allow more people from Ukraine to join relatives in the UK has been launched by the government, but plans for a humanitarian refugee scheme to help those without family ties in Britain have yet to be announced. The Home Office said it had increased its weekly visa processing appointments in the region from 500 to 6,000 a week to speed up applications from individuals hoping to join relatives in Britain, and increased the amount of time people will be allowed to stay in Britain from one to three years. Officials said it was too soon to say how many people would apply. With the UN reporting that 1 million people have already left their homes in Ukraine, and warning that 4 million could flee the country if the conflict escalates, refugee organisations called on the government to speed up the announcement of a wider humanitarian scheme. Officials have promised that an “unlimited sponsorship route” will open soon for Ukrainian’s without family ties here, allowing communities, local authorities and others to sponsor and support those in need to come to the UK, but say that details of how it will operate are still being worked out. The British Red Cross welcomed the family visa announcements, but called for the government to allow Ukrainians to travel here without a visa, “in line with the approach taken in the EU”, adding it was “vital that people who don’t have family in the UK are able to get here safely too”. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said it was not yet clear whether the schemes being devised by the government would match those already announced by the EU. “Any Ukrainian who wants to get to the UK should be able to do that through a safe and immediately accessible route. The most effective way would be to grant them humanitarian visas, to allow them to come as a refugee and be entitled to all the support that they need.” The Ukraine family scheme will allow parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren and siblings of British nationals and people settled in the UK to join relatives in the UK; they will be granted the right to work and to claim benefits. The scheme is radically different from the evacuation programme launched in response to the Afghanistan crisis in August, because officials assume that those who apply will stay with relatives and are not proposing to block book hotel rooms to accommodate them. More than 250 British immigration lawyers have come together to offer pro-bono assistance to people applying for visas; CJ McKinney, coordinating the Ukraine Advice Project, said dozens of emailed requests for help were coming in every hour. The home secretary, Priti Patel, visited Poland to look at the UK’s visa processing systems on Friday, and said: “While we want people to be able to return to their homes at the end of this diabolical invasion, giving thousands of people a route to the UK is the right thing to do.” Despite the launch of an expanded scheme, several Ukrainians trying to flee to the UK told the Guardian of difficulties they were having in obtaining visas. Yakiv Voloshchuk, 60, a British citizen, rescued his Ukrainian wife, Oksana Voloshchuk, 41, and their diabetic daughter, Veronika, 15, from Poland’s border with Ukraine on 26 February and drove them to the UK visa centre in Paris. They began to queue for a visa for Oksana and Veronika on Monday morning but say that even though they were eligible for the earlier visa scheme announced by the Home Office, Oksana and Veronika have still not obtained their visas. The family is becoming increasingly desperate and is running out of money. Adil Arslan is a British citizen living in the UK with his Ukrainian wife, Tetiana Hill, but her children, Maksym and Alina, Arslan’s stepchildren, are stranded in Ukraine, spending much of their time sheltering in an underground bunker. No visa has yet been granted even though the scheme announced on Friday includes stepchildren. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has said there should be a more flexible “emergency protection visa”. “People need a simple and safe route to sanctuary right now,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/property-of-russian-elites-could-be-handed-to-ukrainian-refugees-says-raab","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T17:54:01Z","webTitle":"Property of Russian elites could be handed to Ukrainian refugees, says Raab","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/property-of-russian-elites-could-be-handed-to-ukrainian-refugees-says-raab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/property-of-russian-elites-could-be-handed-to-ukrainian-refugees-says-raab","fields":{"headline":"Property of Russian elites could be handed to Ukrainian refugees, says Raab","bodyText":"Russian elites could have their property seized and handed over to Ukrainian refugees, the deputy prime minister has suggested. Dominic Raab made the remarks as he defended the UK’s response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Asked whether Britain could capture property assets owned by Russian oligarchs, he told LBC: “If we’ve got the evidence and the legal basis, then we’ll do it.” Pressed on whether he would back using those properties to house Ukrainian refugees – a move called for by the Liberal Democrats and reportedly argued for in government by the housing secretary, Michael Gove – Raab replied: “Yes, absolutely. “We are looking at everything in the round, it is a team effort across government, from the foreign and defence secretary through to Michael Gove and, of course, the prime minister is driving this very hard.” The UK’s strategy appears to be based on trying to cause the whole Russian economy pain, which is why it has focused more on banking, state institutions and companies than individuals so far. However, government sources have repeatedly said they are planning to target more oligarchs and politically connected people in “weeks and months”. Also on the list will be all members of the Russian parliament from both houses, and members of the Russian security council who voted for the invasion. Two more oligarchs, Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov, faced sanctions on Thursday and their assets in the UK have been frozen. However, the Foreign Office refused to confirm whether any assets belonging to Vladimir Putin himself have been identified and frozen after sanctions against him last week. The Foreign Office is understood to be confident that Shuvalov owns flats in Westminster worth an estimated £11m, and that Usmanov owns a £48m mansion in Hampstead and a Tudor manor in Surrey, though a spokesperson for Usmanov on Wednesday denied he was the owner. It was unclear which property or properties the spokesperson was referring to, but it raises the prospect Usmanov may have tried to offload property or is contesting the asset freeze. Sources said individuals who had faced sanctions would no longer be allowed to repair their property without a licence, or rent or sell it. The UK government has faced criticism for being too slow in its approach to implementing sanctions against Russian figures and linked assets. The Labour party chair, Anneliese Dodds, said the UK had to “stop dragging” its feet in clamping down on funds that have come from figures linked to Putin. She told Sky News: “I certainly would say that we have been far too soft, especially over the last 10 years, on those funds that have come from Putin-linked oligarchs and business people.” She added: “We see, even with the new measures that finally have been extracted from the government now that they say they will announce on Monday, an 18-month window before they will come into action – that’s just not good enough. “We need immediate action now. We can put those registers of foreign-owned property into place in 28 days, we believe we could get those running and force that transparency.” Raab, however, said the UK was “at the vanguard” of imposing sanctions on Kremlin-linked money. Asked why the EU had imposed sanctions on more individual Russian elites than Britain had, he said on BBC Breakfast it was a “false distinction”, adding: “The question is not whether it is individuals or companies – it is where the money is flowing.” Separately, he said: “There has been a running commentary that the UK has somehow been slow – we’ve not been slow. We’ve been at the vanguard of taking action and, of course, what is really important is we act in concert with our allies, European, American and other Nato allies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2020/oct/21/welsh-politicians-urge-openness-on-impact-of-mud-from-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-21T17:45:34Z","webTitle":"Welsh politicians urge openness on impact of mud from nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/21/welsh-politicians-urge-openness-on-impact-of-mud-from-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2020/oct/21/welsh-politicians-urge-openness-on-impact-of-mud-from-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Welsh politicians urge openness on impact of mud from nuclear power station","bodyText":"The builders of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station must be completely open about the potential environmental impact of dumping tens of thousands of tonnes of mud in the sea near Cardiff, politicians in Wales have said. EDF is proposing to deposit mud excavated as part of the huge construction project on the Somerset coast in the waters off the Welsh capital next year. The Welsh parliament debated the issue on Wednesday after 10,000 people signed a petition calling for a full environmental impact assessment (EIA) to be carried out on the proposal. Petitioners, led by the musician Cian Ciarán, of the band Super Furry Animals, fear the mud could be contaminated and may cause environmental damage and harm the health of people who live in south Wales. Ahead of the debate, EDF confirmed it would carry out a full EIA but members of the Welsh parliament, or Senedd Cymru, said it was vital the findings – and the workings – were published in full. Llyr Gruffydd, a Plaid Cymru member of the Senedd, said there were “real concerns” that the dumping may harm marine life and put public health in danger. “Radioactive particles from the outflow pipes of Hinkley Point A and Hinkley Point B have been flushed out for the last 55 years,” he said. “We know there were plutonium leaks in the 1970s that might also have contaminated the mud they want to dump in Welsh waters.” Andrew RT Davies, the Tory shadow health minister in the Senedd, said people had “genuine concerns” about the mud. He said it was important EDF was not allowed to “mark its own homework” and the workings behind its EIA had to be shown. Outside the Senedd chamber, Ciarán expressed concern about the possible scope of the EIA. He said: “Irrespective of the debate, our campaign isn’t going away quietly. The strength of the public’s feeling, as demonstrated by the petition, means that Senedd members, Natural Resources Wales, EDF and Westminster cannot take the Welsh people for granted.” EDF insists that previous testing has shown that the mud it intends to deposit is no different from that found elsewhere in the Bristol Channel and is not classed as radioactive under UK law. But it said that it had listened to concerns raised during a previous drop of mud in 2018 and would carry out the EIA. Chris Fayers, head of environment at Hinkley Point C, said: “For this second phase of dredging, we intend to go further than normal regulatory requirements in order to provide the public with additional reassurance. We have proposed a testing plan that goes above and beyond internationally recognised best practice, with more samples at greater depth and with a greater range of analysis – including tests for pure alpha-emitting particles and tritium. “We also intend to conduct a full environmental impact assessment as part of our disposal licence application. We believe it is right to go beyond technical arguments to provide the necessary public confidence that all concerns have been addressed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/sep/15/hitachi-to-pull-plug-on-north-wales-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-16T09:46:38Z","webTitle":"Hitachi to pull plug on north Wales nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/15/hitachi-to-pull-plug-on-north-wales-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/sep/15/hitachi-to-pull-plug-on-north-wales-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Hitachi to pull plug on north Wales nuclear power station","bodyText":"The Japanese conglomerate Hitachi has conformed it is abandoning plans to build a new nuclear power station on Anglesey, off the coast of north Wales, dashing hopes for thousands of jobs involved in its construction and knocking the UK’s ambition to become a “net zero carbon” emission country by 2050 off course. The Tokyo-based multinational said Wednesday it was permanently scrapping plans for the £16bn Wylfa power station. “Hitachi made this decision given that 20 months have passed since the suspension, and the investment environment has become increasingly severe due to the impact of Covid-19,” it said in a statement. The company said it would coordinate with the British government and relevant organisations regarding the handling of the planned construction sites and other issues. The decision to scrap the project, which would have provided around 6% of Britain’s electricity, was not expected to have significant impact on Hitachi’s business results as the company has already written down most of the related assets, it added. Work on the Wylfa Newydd project, which is next door to an existing, decommissioned power plant, had already been suspended after Hitachi failed to reach a funding agreement with the UK government, but the planning process continued. Justin Bowden, national officer of the GMB union, said: “This utterly predictable announcement from Hitachi is the outcome of successive government failures to act decisively around new nuclear, and in particular how it is financed. New nuclear is vital in achieving decarbonisation, especially when teamed up with hydrogen. “It’s no coincidence that around the world – almost without exception – it’s governments who finance these projects, as they are the lender of last resort when it comes to keeping the lights on. The fanciful experiment of trying to get foreign companies or governments to fund our future energy needs leaves most ordinary citizens in this country bewildered.” A group of 100 organisations, including unions and businesses, backing plans to build a nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk, also voiced concern about the Wylfa decision. Cameron Gilmour, spokesman for the Sizewell C Consortium said: “This news will have serious ramifications for companies both in Wales and across the UK. The Wylfa nuclear project would have been another important milestone for the UK’s nuclear supply chain and would have created thousands of jobs. “Unless Sizewell C, a replica of the under-construction Hinkley Point C, is given the go-ahead, there is now a serious risk to the future of the UK’s civil nuclear construction capability and the tens of thousands of jobs that go with it.” Dr Doug Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said: “Nuclear power’s ever-rising costs overtook the ever-falling costs of renewables years ago, and a new reactor now supplies electricity at more than double the price of a new offshore windfarm. “Propping up this dying industry has become more and more difficult and expensive for the handful of governments still hoping for a nuclear renaissance. We’re hoping the UK government will take Hitachi‘s decision to abandon Wylfa as final confirmation of what the energy market has long been trying to tell them – Britain’s future is renewable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/berliners-rally-to-support-ukraine-refugees-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T15:26:02Z","webTitle":"‘Tip of the iceberg’: Berliners rally to welcome refugees from Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/berliners-rally-to-support-ukraine-refugees-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/berliners-rally-to-support-ukraine-refugees-germany","fields":{"headline":"‘Tip of the iceberg’: Berliners rally to welcome refugees from Ukraine","bodyText":"When Iman Abdikarim joined a Telegram group to help Ukrainian refugees on a whim earlier this week, it had only 17 members and only vague ideas of what it might do. By Friday morning, the masters student was directing a chaotic throng of arrivals inside Berlin’s main station, as Germany’s “welcome culture” returned to the foreground. The Telegram group now has almost 8,000 volunteers and is central to efforts to provide refugees with temporary accommodation, food and clothes. “I’ve been working 10 hours every day this week, and I’ve got to work shifts at the clinic at night,” said the 27-year-old with Somali roots in an upbeat tone. “But we are learning what the people who come here need.” Her mobile phone buzzes every few seconds with new messages, some of them from Ukraine, others from more Berliners who want to help. Behind her back, another volunteer coordinator shouts into a megaphone: “If you speak Russian or Ukrainian, stay. If you don’t, please come back tonight.” Scenes at Berlin’s central station mirror those from the summer of 2015, when large parts of German civic society rallied to aid asylum seekers arriving from Syria. In terms of sheer numbers, however, the challenge is starker: at the height of the influx of arrivals in 2015 and 2016, authorities in Berlin had to coordinate shelter for about 700 people and struggled, temporarily repurposing sports halls. This Thursday alone, 6,500 refugees arrived in the city by train, according to Berlin’s senator for social affairs. In each of the previous two days more than 1,000 people have arrived. Operator Deutsche Bahn, which has been handing out free travel tickets to refugees from Ukraine, says it has doubled its number of direct trains to the Polish border. “We have to prepare for the fact that the largest movement of refugees since the end of the second world war is headed for Europe,” said senator Katja Kipping. “What we have seen so far is only the tip of the iceberg.” The hope in Germany’s administrative apparatus is that relaxed visa rules will avoid bottleneck situations: since 2017, Ukrainians with biometric passports have been able to travel to the Schengen zone and stay for 90 days out of every 180 without needing a visa. Sixteen-year-old Viktor Levchenko arrived at Berlin central station on Friday morning, with his mother and cousin, having left Kyiv 48 hours before. Carrying a backpack each and a paper bag with basic supplies such as flour, toilet rolls and soap given to them by volunteers, they waited on the cold ground floor of the station for a Berlin-based Ukrainian friend to pick them up and host them for a few days. “We are working out what to do,” Levchenko said. “For now, we must stay in Germany. But afterwards, we must go back.” After arriving in Berlin, they called his aunt and uncle who had stayed behind in Kyiv to serve in the military. As they were speaking over the phone, they could hear air-raid sirens in the background. Even before Vladimir Putin’s army started its incursion on to Ukrainian soil last week, asylum applications in Germany had risen to a four-year high in 2021, following a drop during the first year of the pandemic. As shelters in the capital were close to full capacity at the start of the year, the senate proposed renting empty hotels and hostels on an ad hoc basis. On Friday, Kipping said the city was planning to erect a tent outside the central station that would provide temporary resting places and sanitary facilities to those arriving from Ukraine before they were transported by shuttle buses to shelters in Berlin or nearby cities like Leipzig. But until now, the brunt of the aid effort has been facilitated by volunteers, such as Mirjam König, who was waiting by the side of arrival point at Hauptbahnhof with her toddler son on her arm. A cardboard sign rested on the buggy next to her, saying: “One room for woman with 1/2 children.” König said she had posted her offer of a room on a volunteering website three days earlier but did not get a response. “Maybe it’s more practical this way,” she said, while bouncing her son in her arms. “I wanted to exhaust all my options.” “If something like this happened to me, I would hope there will be people offering me their help too. When injustice happens on this Earth, you want to do something about it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2022/mar/04/airbnb-suspends-all-operations-in-russia-and-belarus","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T13:13:59Z","webTitle":"Airbnb suspends all operations in Russia and Belarus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/04/airbnb-suspends-all-operations-in-russia-and-belarus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/mar/04/airbnb-suspends-all-operations-in-russia-and-belarus","fields":{"headline":"Airbnb suspends all operations in Russia and Belarus","bodyText":"Airbnb has suspended all operations in Russia and Belarus, and also stopped users of the home rental site from both countries from making any bookings, in the company’s latest response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The home rental firm, which has almost 100,000 short-term rentals available across both countries according to the market research firm AirDNA, has been vocal in its support of Ukraine. Brian Chesky, the co-founder and chief executive of Airbnb, who has added the Ukrainian flag to his Twitter profile, tweeted the suspension in a one-line post. The company elaborated on Chesky’s tweet, adding that the ban would extend to Airbnb members of those countries trying to make any bookings on the site. “This means that we will block calendars from accepting new bookings in both countries until further notice,” said a spokesperson for the company. “We will also restrict users in Belarus and Russia from making new reservations as guests. We certainly hope that as we look to the future, a path to peace is forged.” Russia has more than 93,000 listings on Airbnb, and Belarus almost 4,000, according to AirDNA. On Thursday, Airbnb waived fees for hosts and those booking rentals in Ukraine. It took the decision after members of the public began making bookings in Ukraine with no intention of travelling as a way of providing financial support to residents facing hardship during the invasion. Ukraine has more than 17,000 active short-term rental listings. On Monday, Airbnb pledged to offer free housing to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. The company has said it has received “overwhelming support” for the initiative, with more than 260,000 visitors so far to a dedicated web page where it is possible to sign up to be a host or to donate. Earlier this week, Chesky said the company was assessing its options regarding its Russian operation. “We don’t have a large business in Russia,” he told CNN. “It is not one of our major markets. [But] we are absolutely revisiting our relationship [about whether] to do business in Russia.” Last year, Airbnb took bookings for 300m nights across 4 million hosts globally, worth a total of $46.8bn (£35.3bn). The company, which was founded in 2008, was floated in 2020, soaring to a market value of about $100bn. Airbnb joins a rapidly increasing and extensive list of companies that are severing ties or pausing operations in Russia, including Ikea, the global recruitment company Hays, Apple, Netflix and all the major Hollywood studios, the retailers H&amp;M, Marks &amp; Spencer, Burberry and Boohoo, and car manufacturers including Ford, BMW and Mercedes-Benz."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-421-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-20T13:12:27Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 421 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-421-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-421-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 421 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine’s future lies in Nato, the western military alliance’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Thursday during his first visit to the country since Russia’s invasion 14 months ago. He pledged continued military support for Ukraine, saying that, so far, Nato allies had trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops and provided €65bn ($71.31bn) of military aid alone. “Nato stands with you today, tomorrow and for as long as it takes,” Stoltenberg stated, before inviting Vladmir Zelenskiy to the Nato summit in Vilnius in July. Zelenskiy said Nato needs to invite Ukraine to become a member and give it a timeframe for accession. “I am grateful for the invitation to visit the summit, but it is also important for Ukraine to receive the corresponding invitation,” he told reporters. “There is not a single objective barrier to the political decision to invite Ukraine into the alliance and now, when most people in Nato countries and the majority of Ukrainians support Nato accession, is the time for the corresponding decisions.” Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s longtime foreign minister, will meet the UN secretary general António Guterres on Monday, according to Russia’s ambassador to the UN. The two last met at the G20 summit in Bali in November. According to ambassador Vassily Nebenzia the Black Sea grain deal will be an item for the meeting on Monday. Denmark, together with the Netherlands, is to donate 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Denmark’s acting defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen said they are not Danish tanks, but tanks “which are bought in collaboration with the Netherlands”. Foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen described it as “a very significant contribution”. Russian state-owned news agency Tass has cited Ismini Palla, spokesperson for the UN office at the joint coordination centre for the deal in Istanbul, saying that “inspections of vessels under the grain deal resumed on 19 April and are scheduled for 20 April”. The Donetsk People’s Republic, the Russian-imposed authority in Ukraine’s occupied Donetsk region, has claimed that overnight a woman has been killed in the city of Donetsk by shelling from Ukrainian armed forces. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine which Russia captured last year will stop using US-produced nuclear fuel as quickly as possible, the Interfax news agency quoted a Russian official as saying. The admiral of Russia’s Pacific fleet has left his position after a check of its combat readiness. Adm Sergei Avakyants left his post as commander on Thursday as it was announced he will oversee a new centre for military sports training and “patriotic education”. Units from the Pacific fleet had been taking part in inspection exercises that were announced by the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, last week. A flash in the sky over Kyiv prompted confusion and alarm as city authorities said it was caused by a Nasa satellite reentering the atmosphere, while the US space agency denied involvement. A “bright glow” was observed over Kyiv around 10pm local time and shortly after, the Ukrainian air force said the flash was “related to the fall of a satellite/meteorite”. Russia’s federal security service, the FSB, seems to be conducting “a large-scale overhaul of domestic security organs,” the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, reports in its update today. The overhaul appears to be related to leaks of data to Ukraine, the ISW reports. The Financial Times has reported that a leaked US intelligence report shows that China refused a request from the Wagner mercenary group for weapons. Wagner’s request in early 2023 suggested “it had some confidence Beijing would be open to arming Moscow, going beyond other non-lethal forms of support for the military campaign provided by Chinese companies,” the FT reported. Switzerland will add the private military Wagner group and news agency RIA to its list of Russian sanctioned entities. A group of Ukrainian servicemen have been accused of treason for giving away information during an unauthorised mission that enabled Russia to attack a military airfield, Ukraine’s SBU security agency said on Thursday. The SBU said in a statement that the servicemen had attempted, “without coordination with the relevant state authorities”, to seize a Russian plane last July after its pilot said he would defect. Ukraine has received two types of air defence system ahead of the Ramstein military group meeting on Thursday, where it will ask for more supplies. A Patriot air defence system delivery was confirmed by the defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, on Wednesday. The second of four promised German Iris-T system were also delivered, according to a German newspaper which had spoken to government officials. No official announcements have been made. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has criticised the delays in the EU plan for jointly buying ammunition for Ukraine. The EU agreed the purchase of 1m artillery rounds for Ukraine in March, but there are still discussions about the plan’s details. The US and other allies of Ukraine are considering an outright ban on most exports to Russia in an attempt to increase economic pressure on Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The report by the Bloomburg business website says discussions are under way ahead of the G7 leaders’ summit in May. It is thought that it will be followed by similar actions by EU member states. The United States announced $325m in new military aid for Ukraine, including additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, advanced missiles and anti-tank mines. It is the 36th security package since the war began in February 2022. The European Commission is proposing €100m (£88m) in compensation for EU farmers affected by the recent influx of Ukrainian grain as well as restrictions on selling wheat and maize in affected countries, in a move to calm tensions with central and eastern Europe. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the commission, has written to the leaders of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, setting out support measures after four of those countries banned the import or sale of grain and other food products inside their borders earlier this week. Bulgaria had confirmed its temporary halt on Wednesday. A Ukrainian military spokesperson accused Moscow of a “provocation” after Russian proxy forces said Ukrainian forces had blown up four buildings in the eastern city of Bakhmut, killing 20 civilians. The spokesperson said Ukrainian forces never target civilians. Russia also denies targeting civilians. A Ukrainian brigade that vows to “destroy Russian troops” simulated a skirmish in the woods near Kyiv on Thursday, as the country pushes ahead with plans for a counteroffensive – with the hope of getting similar results to the one that swept across south-eastern Ukraine in autumn 2022. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Wednesday during a visit to Sweden that the US looks forward to welcoming Sweden as a Nato member before the alliance’s summit in July, and will encourage Turkey and Hungary to ratify accession. Along with Finland, Sweden applied to join Nato in May last year. Finland’s application was processed in record time and it became the 31st member of the alliance earlier this month. A joint investigation by the public broadcasters of several Nordic countries alleges that Russia has established a programme using spy ships disguised as fishing vessels aimed at giving it the capability to attack windfarms and communications cables in the North Sea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/29/french-teachers-and-transport-workers-strike-over-pay-and-pension-age","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-29T11:54:30Z","webTitle":"French teachers and transport workers strike over pay and pension age","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/29/french-teachers-and-transport-workers-strike-over-pay-and-pension-age","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/29/french-teachers-and-transport-workers-strike-over-pay-and-pension-age","fields":{"headline":"French teachers and transport workers strike over pay and pension age","bodyText":"Street demonstrations have been held across France as schools and transport services were disrupted by the first major strike since Emmanuel Macron won re-election as president in April. Primary school teachers stopped work on Thursday, as did train and bus drivers on certain regional services and nuclear power industry workers, in what was seen as a test for trade unions’ ability to mobilise support. Workers marched in cities across France as unions pushed for salary increases to address the impact of inflation and rising prices. Unions also called for the scrapping of Macron’s plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65 progressively over several years. The president’s insistence on pushing through changes to the pensions system – one of his main re-election campaign pledges – remains broadly unpopular in polling. It has mobilised leftwing trade unions as well as opposition parties on the left and far right who have threatened to block the government’s path. Ministers said on Thursday that draft legislation on pensions changes would be ready by Christmas, with a consultation process to begin next week. But Macron’s centrist party lost its parliament majority in June elections, which has seriously undermined its ability to push through major legislative changes such as the pensions plan. The labour minister, Olivier Dussopt, said he could not rule out Macron dissolving parliament if opposition parties teamed up to block the government. This would immediately trigger fresh parliament elections. The government is leaning on rightwing politicians from the Les Républicains party to try to gain their support for its pension measures in order to get the bill through. “We are against pushing back the age of retirement because we consider it an aberration when there are so many unemployed people in this country,” Philippe Martinez, the head of the leftwing CGT union, told BFM television. He added: “Wages must be increased as there is a cost of living problem in this country.” Mathilde Panot, the parliamentary leader of the left’s France Unbowed party, tweeted ahead of the strikes: “If the president insists on declaring a social war on the people, we will respond with all the means at our disposal.” The government argues that Macron has approved wage increases for civil servants and teachers and put in place one of Europe’s most generous anti-inflation safety nets that has capped energy prices for households and held down inflation. But unions said wages were still being eroded by inflation and more needed to be done. The promised salary increases for teachers are not expected until late next year, with confusion surrounding which teachers would benefit and by how much. “We can really see that teachers are fed up with their salaries … if on top of that, there’s the issue of pensions, it risks creating some sparks,” said Guislaine David from the Snuipp-FSU union. About one in 10 schools in Paris are expected to shut for the day on Thursday, while 300 will close in the southern Bouches-du-Rhone area which includes Marseille."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/04/government-chaos-delays-uk-sahara-energy-link","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-04T23:42:12Z","webTitle":"£18bn project to link UK to huge wind and solar farm in Sahara delayed by a year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/04/government-chaos-delays-uk-sahara-energy-link","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/04/government-chaos-delays-uk-sahara-energy-link","fields":{"headline":"£18bn project to link UK to huge wind and solar farm in Sahara delayed by a year","bodyText":"An £18bn project to connect Britain with a huge wind and solar farm in the Sahara through an undersea cable has been delayed by at least a year because of political ructions in Westminster. The energy startup Xlinks hopes to provide 8% of Britain’s electricity supplies through a 3,800km (2,360-mile) cable linking Morocco with the UK, powering 7m homes by 2030. The project had been expected to begin generating power by 2027. However, that target date now appears unlikely. The Xlinks’ executive chair, Sir Dave Lewis, a former chief executive of Tesco, warned that the recent political turmoil that has seen off three prime ministers in less than six months has stalled its progress. He has been trying to secure a government “contract for difference” – a mechanism under which public subsidies are used to offer low-carbon generators, such as windfarms, a fixed price for power. The arrangement aims to encourage investment by making revenues more predictable. Lewis told the Guardian: “We spent a long time with the then business secretary [Kwasi Kwarteng] who said: ‘We like it a lot but it needs to go through Treasury.’ There was a review with Treasury, Cabinet Office and the business department, which was very positive. “Then we came back to them to start the detail and the political world exploded and, as a result, everything stopped. And everybody has changed, so it’s sort of like you’re starting again. “Time is important for the UK to meet its net zero ambitions, to secure energy supplies and to reduce bills. We have lost a year.” Xlinks was founded in 2019 by its chief executive, Simon Morrish, who has grown the environmental services business Ground Control across the UK. When the Morocco-UK link is complete, Xlinks expects to generate 20 hours of reliable renewable energy a day using the Sahara’s sunshine and breezy night-time conditions. The plan is to build almost 12m solar panels and 530 windfarms over the 960 sq km area of desert. The site, in the Guelmim-Oued Noun region, will also have 20 gigawatt hours of battery storage. The cable transporting power from the site will hug the Moroccan coastline, then pass alongside Portugal, northern Spain and France before looping around the Isles of Scilly to terminate at Alverdiscott in north Devon, where Xlinks has already agreed to 1.8 gigawatt connections. Morocco has an established wind, solar and hydroelectric power industry, and its solar intensity, a measure of generation power, is second only to Egypt and double that of the UK, according to data from Xlinks. The power lines will be laid by the world’s largest cable-laying ship and buried beneath the seabed to mitigate the risk of damage from fishing boats. The company is in the process of studying the seabed and gaining offshore permits. Xlinks hopes to land a strike price of £48 per megawatt hour, lower than the £92.50 agreed for the delayed Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset. The company argues that despite the scale of the project, it can be more reliable for the security of UK energy supplies than domestic options because UK wind power can be hugely variable. Last week National Grid issued, and later cancelled preparations to launch its emergency winter plan after low wind and solar power left supplies tight. Lewis has personally invested in the Xlinks project, along with Octopus Energy and its founder Greg Jackson. Growing demand for renewable power has stretched supplies across the industry. In response, its sister company XLCC plans to build two factories to manufacture cables in Hunterston on the west coast of Scotland and another at a yet to be announced site in north-east England. The first received planning permission in June, and is expected to create 900 jobs. Lewis, who worked for the consumer goods company Unilever for 27 years, became Tesco’s chief executive in 2014. He quickly had to tackle an accounting black hole and is credited with turning around Britain’s largest retailer before leaving in 2020. He is now chair of Haleon, the consumer goods company spun off from GlaxoSmithKline earlier this year. • This article was amended on 5 and 7 December 2022.

But we’ve been sold a dud","bodyText":"These are unsettling times. As scientists have issued ringing warnings about the dangers we face from continued fossil fuel burning, an energy crisis has been triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This unprecedented double threat clearly requires an urgent response, which the government supplied last week in the form of its energy security strategy. And it includes some eye-catching headlines, particularly on the expansion of nuclear power. But does it deliver what it says on the tin? The answer is straightforward. It fails. At the heart of most definitions of energy security is reliability of supplies for households and businesses. This is usually complemented by a focus on affordability. It is no good if energy is available, but the price is too high for businesses to function or households to keep warm. The new strategy does very little to deal with the immediate impacts of high fossil fuel prices. While the government has announced some help for households via loans and a council tax reduction, this is simply not enough. The energy price cap has already risen to almost £2,000 a year and a further rise is due in the autumn. This comes on top of a wider cost of living crisis and high levels of inflation. While more money to help people pay their bills is needed, this must be accompanied by action to prevent these acute impacts in future. This means making homes more efficient and switching away from fossil fuels for heating. It is nearly a decade since effective policies for home energy efficiency were cancelled and replaced with new approaches, such as the green deal, which have failed spectacularly. As a result, the steady improvements in efficiency and financial benefits to households have virtually stopped. A new programme of home upgrades is urgently needed. This would not only reduce our dependence on gas, but would also cut bills and carbon emissions. According to many headlines, nuclear power is the “centrepiece” of the strategy. The government’s plans are ambitious, but delivery will be difficult. New nuclear plants will not have an impact for many years. The Treasury’s fingerprints are visible in the careful caveats in the strategy, including an insistence that new projects are “subject to a value for money and relevant approvals”. This reflects the long history of rising costs within the nuclear sector and the financial risks that consumers or taxpayers will be exposed to. British nuclear power programmes have been the subject of many false dawns. In 1979, energy minister David Howell announced a programme of 10 nuclear reactors over the next decade. Only one reactor was built, at Sizewell in Suffolk. In 2010, the coalition government agreed to another eight-reactor programme. That new programme has also produced only one plant: Hinkley C in Somerset, which is due to start operating in 2026. While nuclear can reduce emissions and improve some aspects of energy security, the new plans will only be realised if the industry can bring down costs. The real heart of the strategy is increased ambition for offshore wind, which is due to expand at least fourfold by 2030. This is a genuine British success story from which politicians should learn lessons. Initially very expensive, it has been supported by a series of policies by successive governments – and that has brought costs down dramatically. Pushing further with an increased target makes a lot of sense. But it will require more investment in electricity network infrastructure, not just the wind turbines themselves. The government’s willingness to learn from success has clear limits, though. When the strategy turns its attention to onshore wind and solar, logic fails. The costs of both technologies have also fallen dramatically in recent years. They get some warm words, including aspiration that solar capacity will expand by five times by 2035. There are also innovative plans for a few local communities to share the benefits of new onshore wind farms. But a target to double capacity by 2030 was taken out at the 11th hour and very restrictive planning rules for onshore wind remain. Realising these increased ambitions for renewable electricity will require further market reforms. At the moment, cheap renewable power does not translate into low bills for consumers. This is because gas plants often set the wholesale price and their costs are very high. Reforms are needed so that businesses and households can get access to the economic benefits of cheaper renewables. Reforms are also needed to ensure that there is enough flexibility in the system to deal with higher and higher shares of generation that depends on the wind and sun. Finally, what of the role of fossil fuels, which are at the root of the crisis? Plans to produce more in the UK are understandable, but are not the long-term solution to climate change or energy security. They will have very little impact on prices, but could help to squeeze out some Russian imports. The promise of a new independent study of fracking is a distraction, however. It is clear that fracking in the UK is nowhere near as easy to implement as it has been in the United States. Its contribution to gas needs will be modest at best. Industry claims that fracking could produce a large share of the UK’s gas demand are not credible, based on the evidence we have so far. In short, the government has pulled its punches and avoided measures that would have a more immediate impact on energy security – mainly by reducing the amount of energy we need to use. Instead, it has produced a mixed bag of energy supply proposals. While some are credible, a large nuclear power programme will require huge amounts of political and financial capital. History suggests that this will be very difficult to deliver. • Professor Jim Watson is director, UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/10/competition-watchdog-examining-energy-market-interventions-including-possible-price-caps","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-10T08:14:01Z","webTitle":"Competition watchdog examining energy market interventions including possible price caps","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/10/competition-watchdog-examining-energy-market-interventions-including-possible-price-caps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/10/competition-watchdog-examining-energy-market-interventions-including-possible-price-caps","fields":{"headline":"Competition watchdog examining energy market interventions including possible price caps","bodyText":"The Albanese government will receive advice on possible interventions in the energy market as early as next week, including potential price caps, bargaining provisions for smaller energy users, and a legally binding code of conduct for the gas sector. At Senate estimates on Thursday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it was preparing advice on a range of options for a new mandatory code of conduct for the sector, along with guidance on other “regulatory gaps” in the market. It is expected that the government will adopt a suite of reforms to address the 56% increase in electricity prices and the 44% increase in gas prices forecast over the next two years outlined in the October budget. The federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said all options are on the table. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Treasury this week gave the green light to an intervention, arguing that war-induced price shocks being felt by households and businesses required the government to step in. The ACCC chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, told parliament the agency was looking at “enhancements” to the current regulatory framework that would “in legal terms provide greater transparency, certainty and binding outcomes”. She said this included a mandatory code of conduct for the gas sector – as has been widely expected – which would include a reference to prices in contract negotiations. The treasurer had asked the ACCC to look at whether making the voluntary code of conduct around gas purchase negotiations mandatory would assure supply and lead to reasonable pricing, she said. The Greens senator Nick McKim asked whether the scope of the ACCC’s review had “hard boundaries” or whether the regulator could potentially look at capping retail prices. In response, Cass-Gottlieb said that while the first part of the treasurer’s request related to wholesale prices between gas producers and their purchasers, the ACCC had also been asked to look at any other “regulatory gaps” relevant to the current circumstances facing the east coast gas market. “So there is a possibility that the second more general one would address that [retail price caps],” she said. Capping the wholesale price of gas or coal was also “a possible option” the ACCC would consider as part of its work, she said. The regulator flagged new measures to help smaller purchasers of gas negotiate better deals with producers, with Cass-Gottlieb saying the agency was looking at collective bargaining to improve purchasing power “in multiple ways.” Ahead of the likely government intervention, the Coalition has been targeting Labor over energy prices, with the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, arguing for nuclear power to be considered to help ease the pressure on prices. Speaking on 2GB radio, Dutton said the technology for storing renewable energy was not yet available and he accused the government of being “ideologically driven” to switch off coal and gas off before being able to store renewable energy. “In that scenario, the prices continue to go up because there’s this uncertainty in the market and the lights will go out,” Dutton said. “You can have renewables – everyone’s in favour of that, and if the storage comes along, that’s great – but at the moment, you can’t turn off the old system until a new technology is discovered or the science changes.” In parliament, the energy minister, Chris Bowen, ridiculed the opposition for its anti-renewable stance. “The battery was invented by Alessandra Volta in 1800 … but the leader of the opposition is still catching up with this fact,” Bowen said. “The leader of the opposition doesn’t get it … they don’t understand that renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy.

According to the New Scientist, the pleasant reverie in which you imagine yourself in the Desert Island Discs studio modestly explaining your myriad achievements to Lauren Laverne might be bad for you. “Normal” daydreaming is still fine: it fosters creative and lateral thinking, and letting the mind wander could enhance our capacity to learn. But when daydreams prevent you from engaging with life and interfere with your ability to make and maintain relationships, work or learn, researchers call them “maladaptive”. Maladaptive daydreamers use fantasy as a release from stressful thoughts and a difficult present; loneliness, distress and boredom are triggers. Given all that, I don’t suppose you’ll be surprised to hear maladaptive daydreaming seems to be becoming more prevalent. A 2020 study covering 70 countries found participants were more likely to struggle with intense, all-consuming daydreaming in lockdown than during normal life. A 2021 survey of 6,000 Italians found that 17% were atypically preoccupied with their fantasy life. You wouldn’t bet against it reaching epidemic proportions as 2022 staggers on. I wonder if maladaptive is the right characterisation. Who are you calling maladapted? Isn’t retreating to a gentler imaginary world an entirely appropriate way to cope with financial and ecological catastrophe, war playing out around an actual nuclear power plant, Covid, monkeypox and langya (the new zoonotic virus on the block, do keep up)? The typical themes of maladaptive daydreams are, apparently, “love, friendship, self-idealisation, social support and imaginary family”. It would be nicer if we all felt we had those in real life, of course, but who can blame anyone for dreaming of them as the world burns? I’m about ready to give up on reality and surrender to my daydreams, but before I do, I need to train myself to have nicer ones. Mine are all of death, illness, destruction and the bitter settling of scores; day-mares, really. Imagining things are even worse than they actually are: now that’s really maladaptive.

Executives in the energy industry are coordinating efforts with government agencies to assess security arrangements at offshore and onshore sites, to determine whether any best practices employed in other countries, in particular Norway, should be introduced. If the situation escalates, MI5, the Royal Navy and RAF could be called on to provide support for the industry. The move comes after multiple gas leaks were discovered in the Nord Stream pipelines that connect Russia and Germany, leaving natural gas pouring into the Baltic Sea. Sweden found a new leak on Thursday, the fourth discovery of the week. Nato has said the incidents were “deliberate, reckless and irresponsible acts of sabotage”, while Russia has denied it attacked its own pipelines. On Monday, Norway’s oil safety regulator urged oil companies to be more vigilant over unidentified drones seen flying near Norwegian offshore oil and gas platforms. It warned they could pose a risk of accidents or attacks. The developments have prompted the UK energy industry and officials to review risks to its sites. The trade body Offshore Energy (OEUK) said it was in touch with the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on the matter. The CPNI, a government agency, is tasked with reducing the vulnerability of key UK assets – including nuclear power stations and datacentres – to a variety of threats such as terrorism and sabotage. Mark Wilson, the safety director at OEUK, said the action was “precautionary” and a “proportionate, pragmatic response”. He said there was an aspect of uncertainty after the incidents in Europe, adding: “We are not concerned but we are making sure, should anything come up. There is no evidence of any drones or unusual activities around the areas of concern.” A resilience support group spanning industry, regulators and unions has been in place since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February and will study how best to protect Britain’s 11,000 offshore workers. Offshore rigs typically have a 500-metre exclusion zone into which unauthorised vessels, such as fishing boats, cannot enter. No-fly zones and radar monitoring systems are also used to protect assets. There are also ongoing efforts to protect cybersecurity at energy sites. Vladimir Putin has weaponised energy supplies into Europe since the start of the war, cutting gas flows and triggering concerns about blackouts this winter. Danish and Swedish authorities are reviewing the incidents at the Nord Stream pipelines. Their prime ministers have indicated that the leaks were not accidental. Wilson said the outcome of that review would inform any action in the UK, although it could take days for the gas to drain from the Nord Stream pipelines to allow investigators to fully examine the damage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-investigating-fatal-helicopter-crash-british-polish-and-baltic-defence-ministers-to-meet","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T18:49:25Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv to receive ‘hundreds’ of tanks from several nations, says Lithuania – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-investigating-fatal-helicopter-crash-british-polish-and-baltic-defence-ministers-to-meet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-investigating-fatal-helicopter-crash-british-polish-and-baltic-defence-ministers-to-meet","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv to receive ‘hundreds’ of tanks from several nations, says Lithuania – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Lithuania’s defence minister, Arvydas Anušauskas, has said several countries will announce sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at Friday’s meeting of defence ministers at the Ramstein airbase in Germany. The total number of armoured vehicles pledged at tomorrow’s meeting would go into hundreds, Anušauskas told Reuters. A group of 11 Nato countries have pledged a raft of new military aid for Ukraine, ahead of a crunch meeting on arms for Kyiv in Germany on Friday. The aid from countries including Britain, Estonia, Latvia and Poland will include tens of stinger air defence systems, S-60 anti-aircraft guns, machine guns and training, according to a statement. Britain plans to send 600 Brimstone missiles to Ukraine to support the country in its fight against Russia, defence minister Ben Wallace has announced. Speaking at a meeting with other defence ministers at the Tapa army base in Estonia, Wallace outlined a previously announced package of military support for Ukraine, including sending Challenger tanks. “We’re in it for the long haul,” he said. Sweden’s government has announced a new package of military aid to Ukraine that will include armoured infantry fighting vehicles and the Archer artillery system. Poland said it was sending S-60 anti-aircraft guns with 70,000 rounds of ammunition and was ready to donate a company of German-made Leopard 2 tanks, “pending (a) wider coalition” of Leopard donors. Estonia’s defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, announced his country will send military equipment to Ukraine worth €113m in its latest package of support. Denmark announced it will donate 19 French-made Caesar howitzer artillery systems to Kyiv. The US and German defence ministers met today as Berlin faces pressure to allow the transfer of German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine. The meeting between Lloyd Austin and Boris Pistorius came as a German government source told Reuters that Berlin would allow Leopard tanks to be sent to Ukraine to help its defence against Russia if the US agreed to send its own tanks. But US officials have publicly and privately insisted that Washington has no plans to send US-made tanks to Ukraine for now, arguing that they would be too difficult for Kyiv to maintain and would require a huge logistical effort to simply run. A German government spokesperson has said it has yet to receive a request from any country for permission to re-export German-made tanks to Ukraine. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has signalled that it could send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine as part of a wider coalition even without Germany’s approval. “Consent is of secondary importance here, we will either obtain this consent quickly, or we will do what is needed ourselves,” Morawiecki said. He later said he was “moderately pessimistic” about Germany giving other countries permission to send the tanks to Ukraine. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, has said the EU “must spare no effort” in helping Ukraine join the EU during a visit to Kyiv where he met Volodymyr Zelenskiy and members of his government. Michel delivered an address to Ukraine’s parliament, hailing the country’s resilience amid Russia’s invasion and saying “Ukraine is the EU and the EU is Ukraine”. The Kremlin has said Russia will achieve its goals in Ukraine “one way or another” and the sooner Kyiv accepts its demands, the sooner the conflict will end. The Kremlin has repeatedly said Russia is ready to halt military operations if Ukraine meets its demands, but Moscow has not publicly outlined details of its negotiating position or what it is seeking from Kyiv in order to end hostilities. The Kremlin said Ukrainian strikes on Russian-annexed Crimea would be “extremely dangerous” after the New York Times reported that US officials were warming to the idea of helping Kyiv strike the peninsula. “This will mean raising the conflict to a new level that will not bode well for European security,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters at his daily briefing. Crimea, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, was annexed by Russia in 2014. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish longtime ally of Vladimir Putin, has warned of a nuclear escalation if Russia is defeated in Ukraine, saying that western politicians “repeated like a mantra: ‘To achieve peace, Russia must lose’”, but “it never occurs to any of them to draw the following elementary conclusion from this: the loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the outbreak of a nuclear war”. Peskov later said the comments made by the deputy chairman of the security council of Russia were fully in accordance with Russia’s nuclear doctrine. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, says he worries the world is becoming complacent about the dangers posed by the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Grossi, speaking to reporters in Kyiv, said a nuclear accident could happen any day and reiterated the situation at the plant was very precarious. Moldova has requested air defence systems from its allies with the aim of strengthening its capabilities as the war in neighbouring Ukraine continues, its president, Maia Sandu, said. Moldova’s spy chief, Alexandru Musteata, warned last month of a “very high” risk of a new Russian offensive towards his country’s east and said Moscow still aimed to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria. A Swedish court has sentenced two brothers to prison for spying for Russia and its military intelligence service GRU for a decade. Iranian-born Peyman Kia, 42, was sentenced to life, while his younger brother, Payam Kia, was sentenced to nine years and 10 months. Between 2014 and 2015, Peyman Kia worked for Sweden’s domestic intelligence agency, and worked with a top-secret unit within the agency that dealt with Swedish spies abroad, according to local media. The case is believed to be one of the most damaging instances of espionage in Sweden’s history. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, says he worries the world is becoming complacent about the dangers posed by the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. The Soviet-era plant, Europe’s largest, was captured by Russian forces in March and has repeatedly come under fire in recent months, raising fears of a nuclear disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the Zaporizhzhia facility. Grossi, speaking to reporters in Kyiv, said a nuclear accident could happen any day and reiterated the situation at the plant was very precarious. He said: I worry that this is becoming routine, that people may believe that nothing has happened so far, so is the director general of the IAEA crying wolf? He said it was his “duty to do everything I can to prevent” an accident from happening at the plant. A German government spokesperson has said it has yet to receive a request from any country for permission to re-export German-made tanks to Ukraine. The comment came as Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, told reporters he was “moderately pessimistic” about Germany giving other countries permission to re-export Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Morawiecki said: I am moderately sceptical, moderately pessimistic because the Germans are defending themselves against this like a devil protects himself against holy water. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, has said the EU “must spare no effort” in helping Ukraine join the EU during a visit to Kyiv where he met Volodymyr Zelenskiy and members of his government. Michel delivered an address to Ukraine’s parliament, hailing the country’s resilience amid Russia’s invasion and saying “Ukraine is the EU and the EU is Ukraine”. He said: I dream that one day, I hope soon, a Ukrainian will hold my job as president of the European Council, or as president of the European parliament, or the commission.” Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, tweeted a photo of him with Michel in the capital, and said the pair discussed the country’s path to EU membership and defence assistance. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Bakhmut, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine. Moldova has requested air defence systems from its allies with the aim of strengthening its capabilities as the war in neighbouring Ukraine continues, its president, Maia Sandu, said. Moldova’s spy chief, Alexandru Musteata, warned last month of a “very high” risk of a new Russian offensive towards his country’s east and said Moscow still aimed to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria. Moldova has long had Russian troops based in Transnistria, a predominantly Russian-speaking region in eastern Moldova. The area has been controlled by pro-Russia separatists since 1992, after a short war when Moscow intervened on the side of the rebels. Russian efforts to destabilise Moldova have so far failed, Sandu told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Lithuania’s defence minister, Arvydas Anušauskas, has said several countries will announce sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at tomorrow’s meeting of defence ministers at the Ramstein airbase in Germany. Anušauskas told Reuters: Some of the countries will definitely send Leopard tanks to Ukraine, that is for sure. The total number of armoured vehicles pledged at tomorrow’s meeting would go into hundreds, Anušauskas said. Mykhailo Podolyak, a political adviser to the Ukrainian president, has called on allies to “stop trembling at Putin and take the final step” to send tanks to Kyiv. “True leadership is about leading by example, not about looking up to others,” he said in a tweet likely aimed at Germany, after a German government source said Berlin will send German-made tanks to Ukraine as long as the US agrees to do likewise.

Peskov later said the comments made by the deputy chairman of the security council of Russia were fully in accordance with Russia’s nuclear doctrine. Boris Johnson has urged the west not to fall for Russia’s threat of nuclear war but instead increase its supply of heavy weaponry to Ukraine. The former UK prime minister appeared at the World Economic Forum in Davos to discuss Ukraine – with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, joining via video link. The number of children confirmed dead in Wednesday’s helicopter crash in Brovary is one, Ukraine’s state emergency services has said, not three, as previously stated. The crash took place near a nursery outside Kyiv, killing interior minister Denys Monastyrskiy and 14 other people. As of Thursday morning 16 victims were still in hospital, including six children, and 14 people were confirmed dead, including the child, according to the head of Kyiv region, Olekskiy Kuleba. A Swedish court has sentenced two brothers to prison for spying for Russia and its military intelligence service GRU for a decade. Iranian-born Peyman Kia, 42, was sentenced to life, while his younger brother, Payam Kia, was sentenced to nine years and 10 months.

The case is believed to be one of the most damaging instances of espionage in Sweden’s history. Serbian and pro-Ukraine activists have filed criminal complaints against Russia’s Wagner paramilitary group and its supporters, accusing it of recruiting Serbs to fight in Ukraine. “We have reasonable suspicion that Vulin … gave orders, directives and guidelines that the activities of the Wagner Group in Serbia should not be prevented,” the group’s leader said. Ukraine has suffered a threefold growth in cyber-attacks over the past year, with Russian hacking at times deployed in combination with missile strikes, according to a senior figure in the country’s cybersecurity agency. The attacks from Russia have often taken the form of destructive, disk-erasing wiper malware, said Viktor Zhora, a leading figure in the country’s SSSCIP agency. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here still, with all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Denmark becomes the latest country to send further military support to Ukraine, announcing that it will donate 19 French-made Caesar howitzer artillery systems to Kyiv. The Danish defence minister, Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, said in a statement: We have been in continuous contact with the Ukrainians about the Caesar artillery in particular and I am happy that we have now received broad support from the Danish parliament to donate it to Ukraine’s freedom struggle. Serbian and pro-Ukraine activists filed criminal complaints against Russia’s Wagner paramilitary group and its supporters on Thursday, accusing it of recruiting Serbs to fight in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Čedomir Stojković, a Belgrade-based lawyer who also leads the October civic group, said that those accused include Russia’s ambassador to Serbia, Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, and Aleksandar Vulin, the head of Serbia’s state Security and Information Agency. “We have reasonable suspicion that Vulin ... gave orders, directives and guidelines that the activities of the Wagner Group in Serbia should not be prevented,” he said. Stojković said that Botsan-Kharchenko, who enjoys diplomatic immunity, could not be prosecuted in Serbia but that he should be ordered to leave the country. Once a criminal complaint is filed, it is up to the state prosecutor to decide whether or not to proceed. Neither Russian embassy to Belgrade nor the BIA replied to Reuters’ requests for comment. Poland’s prime minister has signalled that it could send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine as part of a wider coalition even without Germany’s approval, raising pressure on Berlin before a crunch meeting of allies on more military aid for Kyiv. “Consent is of secondary importance here, we will either obtain this consent quickly, or we will do what is needed ourselves,” the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, told the private broadcaster Polsat News late on Wednesday, Reuters reports. A government spokesperson was not immediately available to comment on whether Morawiecki meant Poland or a group of countries could send tanks without Germany’s consent. Poland had repeatedly signalled that it would only send the tanks as part of a larger coalition. “The most important thing is for Germany, but not only Germany … to offer their modern tanks, their modern heavy weapons, because Ukraine’s ability to defend its freedom may depend on that,” Morawiecki said. Poland and Finland have said they would provide Leopards if Germany lifts its veto as part of a wider coalition, and other countries have indicated they are ready to do so too. The British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, has joined the backlash against comments yesterday by Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign secretary. In his lengthy annual new year press conference yesterday, Lavrov compared the behavious of the west towards Russia with Hitler and Napolean, saying that, using Ukraine as a proxy, “they [the west] are waging war against our country with the same task: the ‘final solution’ of the Russian question. Just as Hitler wanted a ‘final solution’ to the Jewish question, now, if you read Western politicians ... they clearly say Russia must suffer a strategic defeat.” Responding to a call for Jewish organisations to condemn the comments by Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, the British ambassador in Kyiv tweeted: I don’t think it’s just Jewish organisations that should be calling out this insufferable Russian state sponsored antisemitism. It’s been going on for ages, repeatedly articulated, and it has repercussions for everyone when states reduce Holocaust history in this cynical way. Reuters reports that Lavrov has caused outrage before with remarks about Hitler. Last May he said the Nazi leader had “Jewish blood”, drawing angry protests from Israel. Estonia’s defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, has announced his country will send military equipment to Ukraine worth €113m in its latest package of support for the war against Russia. Wallace says the UK has just started another round of basic training of Ukrainian soldiers, with the aim of training at least 20,000 Ukrainian soldiers to repel Russia’s aggression. He concludes by saying: We’re not going anywhere, Mr Putin. We’re here for the long haul. We’re standing by Ukraine. You need to recalculate. You need to make a change. You need to leave Ukraine. Wallace says Britain has “unlocked” a number of military aid packages in the last year, and will be “going further” by sending a squadron of Challenger 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine. The UK will also send at least three batteries of AS-90 155 long-range deep dire artillery, a number of armoured vehicles, including the Bulldog, he said. He continued: Today I can say we’re also going to send another 600 Brimstone missiles into theatre which will be incredibly important in helping Ukraine dominate the battlefield. He said the UK will be working with the US and others “to make sure that this package is put in Ukraine in the right way”. Defence ministers from around the world will gather at the US airbase in Ramstein in Germany on Friday to make it clear to President Vladimir Putin that they stand by Ukraine, Wallace says. President Putin is banking on us getting bored this year. He’s wrong. We will plan for this year and next year and the year after. He adds: We’re in it for the long haul. It is now time to turn the momentum that Ukrainians have achieved and to make sure Russia “understands that the purpose now is to push them back out of Ukraine” and to restore Ukraine’s sovereignty, he says. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is speaking at a joint news conference with his Estonian counterpart, Hanno Pevkur. Wallace says Putin made a number of assumptions when he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine last February: the first, that Ukrainians would not fight. The second, that his military would quickly crush any resistance. Finally, Putin banked on the fact that he “thought the international community was fickle, that it wouldn’t stick together, that we wouldn’t see it through”. Wallace added: None of those have turned out to be true. 2023 is about demonstrating to Putin that the international community isn’t fractured, that the international community is more than ever determined to stand by Ukraine to see it through. Ukraine’s state emergency services has said the number of children confirmed dead in yesterday’s helicopter attack in Brovary is one, not three, as previously stated. The child died when a helicopter carrying the leadership of Ukraine’s interior ministry crashed near a nursery outside Kyiv on Wednesday morning. Ukraine’s national police carried out forensics on body fragments and as a result, the number of dead decreased, said Ukraine’s emergency services. As of Thursday morning 16 victims were still in hospital, including six children, and 14 people were confirmed dead, including the child, according to the head of Kyiv region, Olekskiy Kuleba. The Kremlin has said Russia will achieve its goals in Ukraine “one way or another” and the sooner Kyiv accepts its demands, the sooner the conflict will end. Speaking to reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: The sooner the Ukrainian regime shows its readiness to meet Russia’s demands – which will be achieved one way or another – the sooner everything will end, and the sooner Ukrainian people can begin to recover after this tragedy, which was started by the regime in Kyiv. The Kremlin has repeatedly said Russia is ready to halt military operations if Ukraine meets its demands, but Moscow has not publicly outlined details of its negotiating position or what it is seeking from Kyiv in order to end hostilities. Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he is “sincerely grateful” to the Swedish government after it announced a new package of military aid to Ukraine that will include armoured infantry fighting vehicles and the Archer artillery system. The package is worth 4.3bn Swedish crowns (£339m), and will include about 50 of Sweden’s tracked and armoured Type 90 infantry fighting vehicles, which can be used to transport up to eight infantry soldiers and is equipped with a 40-mm automatic cannon. The government did not specify how many Archer systems it would supply. The package will also include light, portable NLAW anti-tank weapons, mine-clearing equipment and assault rifles. The infantry fighting vehicles, Archer systems and NLAW anti-tank weapons are “powerful weapons that Ukraine’s army needs”, Zelenskiy tweeted. Before the package was presented today, Sweden had announced around 5bn Swedish crowns of military aid to Ukraine as well as several instalments of humanitarian supplies. Ukraine’s victory is of “almost indescribable importance” Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, told a news conference, adding that Ukraine was fighting for the freedom of all of Europe. The US and German defence ministers met today as Berlin faces pressure to allow the transfer of German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine. Germany remains “one of our most important allies”, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said at the start of his meeting with Boris Pistorius, who hours earlier had been sworn in as Germany’s new defence minister. Before the meeting, Austin thanked the German government “for all that it has done to strengthen Ukraine’s self-defence”, without specifically mentioning the issue of tanks. Pistorius said Germany was ready to support Ukraine and that Berlin stood shoulder to shoulder with its allies. He said: Together with our partners, we will continue to support Ukraine in its struggle for freedom and territorial independence and sovereignty. Their meeting came as a German government source told Reuters that Berlin would allow Leopard tanks to be sent to Ukraine to help its defence against Russia if the US agreed to send its own tanks. But US officials have publicly and privately insisted that Washington has no plans to send US-made tanks to Ukraine for now, arguing that they would be too difficult for Kyiv to maintain and would require a huge logistical effort to simply run. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon’s top policy adviser, said the Pentagon still was not prepared to meet Ukraine’s calls for M1 Abrams main battle tanks. A Swedish court has sentenced two brothers to prison for spying for Russia and its military intelligence service GRU for a decade, in what has been called one of the country’s worst cases of espionage. Iranian-born Peyman Kia, 42, was sentenced to life, while his younger brother, Payam Kia, was sentenced to nine years and 10 months. A life sentence in Sweden generally means a minimum of 20-25 years in prison. Between 2014 and 2015, Peyman Kia worked for Sweden’s domestic intelligence agency, and worked with a top-secret unit within the agency that dealt with Swedish spies abroad, according to local media. Payam Kia, 35, helped his brother and “dismantled and broke a hard drive which was later found in a trash can” when his brother was arrested, according to the charge sheet obtained by the Associated Press. The pair appeared before Stockholm district court, where they faced charges of working together to pass information to Russia between September 2011 and September 2021. In its verdict, the court said it was “beyond reasonable doubt that the brothers, together and in consultation, without authorisation and for the benefit of Russia and the GRU, acquired, forwarded and disclosed information” to a foreign power with the purpose of damaging Sweden’s security. Explaining the verdict of a life sentence, the court said the older brother had a “full understanding of the damaging effects – he has acquired, forwarded and disclosed the information to Russia, which constitutes the main threat to Sweden’s security”. Although it had “not been possible to reach full certainty as to what happened”, the court said a picture of what happened “is sufficiently clear for the defendants to be held responsible”. The brothers denied any wrongdoing throughout the trial, which was held behind closed doors and with evidence that is secret. The case is believed to be one of the most damaging instances of espionage in Sweden’s history because the men compiled a list of all the employees within the Swedish security and intelligence service, known by its acronym Sapo. The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, says he is in Kyiv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and members of his government. The people of Ukraine “need and deserve our support”, Michel said in a video posted to Twitter. His trip comes just two weeks before the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is set to visit the Ukrainian capital for a summit. The Kremlin said on Thursday that Ukrainian strikes on Russian-annexed Crimea would be “extremely dangerous”, after the New York Times reported that US officials were warming to the idea of helping Kyiv strike the peninsula. “This will mean raising the conflict to a new level that will not bode well for European security,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters at his daily briefing. Crimea, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, was annexed by Russia in 2014. The comments came as Sweden announced it would be sending the Archer artillery system for use by Kyiv, a vehicle-mounted self-propelled gun howitzer made by Bofors BAE. The country has also committed to sending infantry fighting vehicles in a move announced in a press conference in Stockholm on Thursday morning. A government source in Berlin told Reuters Germany would send German-made tanks to Ukraine so long as the US agreed to do likewise, as Nato partners remained out of step over how best to arm Ukraine in its war against Russia. Germany’s presiden,t Frank-Walter Steinmeier, promised further military support to Ukraine and warned the incoming defence minister that Germany’s armed forces must once again become capable of protecting the country. The Social Democrat Boris Pistorius was officially made minister on Thursday in a ceremony attended by Steinmeier. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish longtime ally of Vladimir Putin, has warned of a nuclear escalation if Russia is defeated in Ukraine, saying that western politicians “repeated like a mantra: ‘To achieve peace, Russia must lose’”, but “it never occurs to any of them to draw the following elementary conclusion from this: the loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the outbreak of a nuclear war”. Peskov later said the comments made by the deputy chairman of the security council of Russia were fully in accordance with Russia’s nuclear doctrine. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said people spent too much time obsessing about Putin and worrying about escalating the conflict. “How can you escalate against a guy who is doing all-out war against a civilian population?” he said. He also cast doubt on whether Russia would use nuclear weapons and internationally isolate itself from countries like China. Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of Kyiv, said on Thursday that 10 adults and six children remained in hospital after Wednesday’s helicopter crash, which killed the interior minister, Denys Monastyrskiy, and 14 others. Kuleba said families of the victims would receive financial assistance, and that children from the kindergarten damaged when the helicopter fell were studying in nearby preschools. Ukraine’s state broadcaster, Suspilne, is reporting that 11 people are still considered missing after Saturday’s attack on a high-rise building in Dnipro. The Kremlin said on Thursday that Ukrainian strikes on Russian-annexed Crimea would be “extremely dangerous”, after the New York Times reported that US officials were warming to the idea of helping Kyiv strike the peninsula. “This will mean raising the conflict to a new level that will not bode well for European security”, Reuters reports the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters at his daily briefing. Crimea, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, was annexed by Russia in 2014. The comments came as the Swedish government announced it would be sending the Archer artillery system for use by Kyiv, a vehicle-mounted self-propelled gun howitzer made by Bofors BAE. It has long been requested by the Ukrainian side. Peskov also commented on the remarks made earlier by Dmitry Medvedev that threatened a nuclear response if Russia were defeated in Ukraine. [see 7.43 GMT] Peskov said the comments were in full accordance with Moscow’s nuclear doctrine. Medvedev had said western politicians “repeated like a mantra: ‘To achieve peace, Russia must lose’”, but “it never occurs to any of them to draw the following elementary conclusion from this: the loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the outbreak of a nuclear war”. As well as the Archer artillery system, Sweden has committed to sending infantry fighting vehicles in a move announced in a press conference in Stockholm on Thursday morning. Reuters notes that the Swedish government has been silent on the number of Archer artillery systems that it is intending to send to Ukraine. Sweden has 48 Archer systems, which is a vehicle-mounted self-propelled gun howitzer made by Bofors BAE. The Swedish government said it had ordered its defence forces to also prepare shipment of the system. The Swedish government has announced it is sending a further package of military aid to Ukraine, which will include the Archer artillery system, which the Ukrainians have long sought. The package also includes the anti-tank robot-57. Fifty combat vehicles will also be sent, which Sweden’s energy and industry minister, Ebba Busch, this morning described as “one of the world’s best combat vehicles”. Ulf Kristersson, the prime minister of Sweden, said “Ukraine’s desire for what they need most weighs heavily”. The air alarm that was in place in Ukraine this morning has ended. It appears to have been caused by Russian planes taking off in Belarus, where the Belarus and Russian air forces have been carrying out joint drills. Oleksiy Kuleba, governor of Kyiv, has provided an update on the situation following yesterday’s helicopter crash which claimed the life of interior minister Denys Monastyrskiy and 14 other people. He posted on Telegram to say: As a result of the tragedy in Brovary, 16 people remain in hospitals, six of whom are children. Others receive treatment on an outpatient basis. Financial assistance will be allocated to the families of the victims. The place where the helicopter fell has been cleared of debris. Windows and doors will be repaired in the damaged building in the near future. Children from the damaged kindergarten are organized to study in nearby preschools, taking into account the wishes of the parents. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has promised further military support to Ukraine and warned the incoming defence minister that Germany’s armed forces must once again become capable of protecting the nation. Social Democrat Boris Pistorius was officially made minister on Thursday in a ceremony attended by Steinmeier. The role of German president is largely ceremonial. Russia’s attack on Ukraine has destroyed Europe’s security order, Steinmeier said at the event, Reuters reports. Steinmeier stressed that Germany would continue to support Ukraine militarily and would help “in the reconstruction of a battered country”. “Germany is not at war, but the years of the peace dividend from which we Germans have benefited so long and abundantly are over,” Steinmeier said. “We have to respond to threats that also target us,” he said. Pistorius is due to meet his US counterpart Lloyd Austin later today, and on Friday defence leaders from around 50 countries and Nato gather at Germany’s Ramstein air base to discuss how to supply Kyiv with more weapons. A German government source has told Reuters that Berlin will only allow German-made tanks to be sent to Ukraine if the United States agrees to send its own tanks. Here is an image from Cambodia today, where Ukrainian demining teams are receiving training from their Cambodian counterparts. Ukraine is currently experiencing an air alert. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has posted to Telegram to tell residents: Residents of Lviv oblast and the entire territory of Ukraine announced an air alert. There is a threat of a missile strike. Immediately go to a shelter or a room where the rule of “two walls” applies. During almost 11 months of full-scale war, we have seen more than once what the enemy is capable of in his hatred and desire to destroy. Take care of yourself and your loved ones, warn those who might not have heard the sound of sirens. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne is reporting that eleven people are still considered missing after Saturday’s attack on a high-rise building in Dnipro. Yesterday it reported that, according to deputy mayor of Dnipro, Mykhailo Lysenko, “municipal workers are still finding remains of bodies while sorting through the debris”, and the remains are being handed over to forensic experts for DNA testing. My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering Davos live for the Guardian, and reports this from former UK prime minister Boris Johnson: Boris Johnson is speaking at this morning’s Ukraine breakfast now, introduced as a “legendary figure” in Ukraine. The former UK prime minister is asked what he thinks is going through Putin’s mind – is there an opportunity to negotiate? Johnson says he is lost in admiration for president Zelenskiy, and the heroism of the Ukrainian people. But, he warns, we can spend too much time obsessing about Putin, and worrying about escalating the conflict. Johnson says he heard these concerns before he approved supply of shoulder-launched anti-tank weapons. But, he says: How can you escalate against a guy who is doing all out war against a civilian population? Putin is not going to use nuclear weapons, Johnson insists, comparing Russia’s president to “the fat boy in Dickens who wants to make our flesh creep”. Using nuclear weapons would create economic paralysis, Johnson points out. Plus, states who are giving him the benefit of the doubt woud turn massively against him – he cites India and China. You can read more here: Davos day 3 – Johnson says Putin is not going to use nuclear weapons – live Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish long-term ally of Vladimir Putin, has been threatening nuclear war again on Telegram. Medvedev has been deputy chairman of the security council of Russia since 2020, and has previously held the roles of both president and prime minister of Russia. On Telegram he said: Tomorrow, at Nato’s Ramstein base, the great military leaders will discuss new tactics and strategies, as well as the supply of new heavy weapons and strike systems to Ukraine. And this was right after the forum in Davos, where underdeveloped political party-goers repeated like a mantra: “To achieve peace, Russia must lose.” And it never occurs to any of them to draw the following elementary conclusion from this: the loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the outbreak of a nuclear war. The nuclear powers did not lose major conflicts on which their fate depends. But this should be obvious to anyone. Even to a western politician who has retained at least some trace of intelligence. While Russia’s nuclear doctrine restricts the use of the weapons to a limited set of circumstances, one of the circumstances is “situations critical to the national security of the Russian Federation.” Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia has reported on Telegram that the “outbuilding of a private household” and “a private house in which no one lived” have been destroyed by Ukrainian fire over the border into his region. He stated that “There are no victims or injured.” The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne is reporting that Yaroslav Yanushevych, Ukraine’s governor of the partially-occupied Kherson region, which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, has said that the region was shelled multiple times and four people were injured as a result yesterday. It reports he said “On 18 January, the Russian army shelled the Kherson region 56 times with artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and mortars, wounding four people. Kherson was shelled 19 times. Shells hit an educational institution and houses.” This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog from my colleague Helen Sullivan. I will be with you for the next few hours. You can contact me on martin.belam@theguardian.com Germany will send German-made tanks to Ukraine so long as the United States agrees to do likewise, a government source in Berlin told Reuters, as Nato partners remained out of step over how best to arm Ukraine in its war against Russia. Ukraine has pleaded for modern Western weapons, especially heavy battle tanks, so it can regain momentum following some battlefield successes in the second half of 2022 against Russian forces that invaded last February. Berlin has veto power over any decision to export its Leopard tanks, fielded by NATO-allied armies across Europe and seen by defence experts as the most suitable for Ukraine. Several times in recent days, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has stressed, behind closed doors, the condition that U.S. tanks should also be sent to Ukraine, the German government source said on condition of anonymity. When asked about Germany’s stance, U.S. President Joe Biden’s spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said: “The president believes that each country should make their own sovereign decisions on what steps of security assistance and what kinds of equipment they are able to provide Ukraine.” The British and Polish defence ministers will meet with their counterparts from the Baltic states in Estonia, in a Ramstein today pre-meeting – ahead of a wider defence summit on Friday – designed to put further pressure on Germany to move forward with sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. But there are signs that London’s manoeuvres are irritating Berlin. A German government source told Reuters that the UK appeared to be ignoring Berlin’s recent decision to provide a Patriot missile defence system and 40 Marder fighting vehicles. Accusing the UK of acting in response to “internal political pressure”, government sources added that leaning on allies was “not helpful”. They added: “The delivery of tanks to Ukraine is not taboo. But such questions will continue to be clarified in transatlantic lockstep”: Wednesday’s crash outside Kyiv came as the head of NATO said at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos that allies were set to provide “heavier weapons” to the war-battered country. Ukraine did not claim direct Russian involvement in the helicopter crash, but President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the tragedy was a consequence of the war. “There are no accidents at war. These are all war results,” Zelensky said in English, appearing by video link at Davos. The helicopter carrying Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky crashed next to a kindergarten and a residential building in Brovary, a commuter town for the capital Kyiv that was the scene of fierce fighting with Russian forces last year, AFP reports. Fourteen people were killed, including Monastyrsky, other ministry officials and a child, Zelensky said in his evening address to the nation. Another 25 people were wounded, including 11 children. He added that an investigation had been opened “to clarify all the circumstances of the disaster”. “Minister Denys Monastyrsky, (his deputy) Yevhen Yenin and their colleagues who died in the crash are not people who can be easily replaced,” Zelensky said. “It is a truly huge loss for the state. My condolences to the families.” Dmytro Serbyn, who was in his apartment when the helicopter crashed, rushed to help children as soon as he saw flames billowing over the kindergarten. “They were looking for their parents, children were crying … their faces were cut and covered in blood,” Serbyn told AFP. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next few hours. Our top story this morning: Ukrainian authorities on Thursday were investigating the circumstances surrounding a helicopter crash that killed the country’s interior minister and 13 others. And coming up today, the British and Polish defence ministers will meet with their counterparts from the Baltic states in Estonia, in a Ramstein pre-meeting designed to put further pressure on Germany to move forward with the Leopard 2s. Here are the other key recent developments: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy”. Nato countries are set to announce new “heavier weapons” for Ukraine, the alliance’s chief has said. Many of Ukraine’s allies will meet on Friday at the Ramstein military base in Germany, including all 30 Nato members. ting vehicles, while France offered its highly mobile AMX-10 RCs. The European Union’s head also spoke in favour of the west providing tanks to Ukraine. “We, the EU, will continue to support them for as long as it takes,” Charles Michel, the European Council president, said on Wednesday. “The time is now – they urgently need more equipment and I am personally in favour of supplying tanks to Ukraine.” Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export at the Davos summit. Canada announced it would donate 200 armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”. Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has written a letter inviting the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, for talks, which was handed to the Chinese delegation in Davos, said the Ukrainian leader’s wife, Olena Zelenska. Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine is “inevitable”. He announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/russia-oligarchs-business-figures-west-sanction-lists-us-eu-uk-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-10T15:38:23Z","webTitle":"Russia: the oligarchs and business figures on western sanction lists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-oligarchs-business-figures-west-sanction-lists-us-eu-uk-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-oligarchs-business-figures-west-sanction-lists-us-eu-uk-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Russia: the oligarchs and business figures on western sanction lists","bodyText":"Dozens of prominent oligarchs have been punished by western governments in retaliation over the invasion of Ukraine.

Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin mentioned a potential settlement to end his war in Ukraine on Friday while still claiming that his “special military operation” was going to plan. Putin also discussed the potential for a nuclear war in his remarks on Friday, saying that Russian nuclear doctrine doesn’t allow for a preventive strike and that in the case of all-out war, strikes against Russia would be “inevitable”. Putin’s remarks came a day after he appeared to revel in recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. Drinking what appeared to be sparkling wine, Putin vowed to keep battering Ukraine’s energy grid despite an outcry against the systematic attacks that have plunged millions into cold and darkness as winter sets in. Putin also said Russia may cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the G7’s price cap on its oil. His comments came after the G7, the EU and Australia announced a $60-a-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil last week. Russian forces have shelled the “entire frontline” in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, has said. The fiercest fighting was near the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, he said, adding that Russian troops were also trying to advance near Lyman, which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in November. The UK’s ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward, said Russia is attempting to obtain more weapons from Iran, including hundreds of ballistic missiles. Moscow is offering Tehran an “unprecedented level” of military and technical support in return for it supplying weapons for the war in Ukraine, Woodward told reporters. Meanwhile, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, warned that Russia is “expanding and modernising its nuclear arsenal”. Ukraine’s state-run power agency has accused Russian forces of abducting two senior Ukrainian staff at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Energoatom said the two abducted members of staff were beaten before being driven off in an “unknown direction” on Thursday. A third worker, who was detained, was responsible for safety at the plant, it said. Russian forces have installed multiple rocket launchers at Ukraine’s shut-down Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to Ukrainian officials. Energoatom said Russian forces occupying the plant have placed several Grad multiple rocket launchers near one of its six nuclear reactors, raising fears that Europe’s largest atomic power station could be used as a base to fire on Ukrainian territory and heightening radiation dangers. The UK Ministry of Defence has said Russia has likely received a resupply of Iranian Shahed-131 and 136 loitering munitions. Friday’s intelligence update comes following new reports over the past three weeks of attacks involving these devices. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian general staff reported shooting down at least 14 Shahed-136s. Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, discussed the latest Russian attacks on the country’s infrastructure in a phone call on Friday. Sunak said “more anti-air guns and further short-range air defence missiles would arrive in the coming weeks”, Downing Street said. A Russian court has sentenced the opposition politician Ilya Yashin to eight and a half years in prison on charges of spreading false information meant to discredit the Russian army. The verdict marks the most high-profile case to date of a Russian dissident being jailed for opposing the invasion of Ukraine. Representatives from Russia and the US met in Istanbul on Friday to discuss “difficult questions”, Russian state media reported. A US embassy spokesperson confirmed that a senior State department official met with Russian interlocutors to discuss “a narrow set of bilateral issues” that did not involve the war in Ukraine. Russian athletes have been offered a path to compete at the Paris 2024 Games even if the war in Ukraine continues to rage for another 18 months. It comes after a proposal was made by the Olympic Council of Asia to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to take part in its qualifying competitions for 2024 – even though they are still banned by most sports. The American basketball star Brittney Griner returned to the US early on Friday after being freed in a high-profile prisoner exchange from nearly 10 months in detention in Russia. Griner was seen getting off a plane at joint base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas, after she was swapped for the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Following his release from US detention, the notorious arms dealer, Viktor Bout, told RT that it was difficult to find the words to describe his feelings after being freed. Nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, Bout is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel who was serving a 25-year sentence for conspiring to sell tens of millions of dollars in weapons US officials said were to be used against Americans. The prisoner exchange of Viktor Bout for Brittney Griner should not be seen as a step towards improving US-Russia bilateral relations, the Kremlin said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov’s comments came as Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said 30 more embassy staff would have to leave in the new year because of visa restrictions, according to state-owned news agency Ria. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced in today’s Guardian that he will place new sanctions on 2,000 individuals and 400 entities across the world with connections to the Kremlin. “We are right to express our horror and revulsion, but our words will always count for more when they are backed by action,” Cleverly wrote. “I will ensure this remains the theme of British diplomacy. We are not passive observers and we should not merely voice our feelings: we will use our country’s leverage to make a difference.” The US has announced fresh sanctions on dozens of people and entities over alleged human rights abuse or corruption across nine countries, including Russia, China and Iran. The latest sanctions list includes Russia’s Central Election Commission, which Washington accused of helping to oversee and monitor what the US said are “sham referendums” held in Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine, as well as 15 of its members. President Joe Biden has authorised $275m in military aid for Ukraine, the White House said. The new package will include weapons and artillery rounds, as well as equipment to help Ukraine boost its air defences, according to a statement by the US defence department. My colleagues Andrew Roth, Pjotr Sauer and Helen Sullivan have the full story on the comments made earlier today by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on a potential settlement to end the war in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin mentioned a potential settlement to end his war in Ukraine on Friday while still claiming that his “special military operation” was going to plan. The Russian president said during remarks at a press conference in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan: The settlement process as a whole, yes, it will probably be difficult and will take some time. But one way or another, all participants in this process will have to agree with the realities that are taking shape on the ground. The remarks came just days after Putin appeared to be girding Russians for a protracted war in Ukraine, saying that his military operation could be a “long-term process”. Initially, Russian commanders expected the war would last just a matter of weeks before a Russian victory, according to plans captured at the beginning of the war. It is now in its 10th month and Russia has been forced to retreat for several months. Despite all evidence to the contrary, Putin claimed that his military operation was going to plan. “Everything is stable. There are no questions or problems there,” he said, adding that information was being given to the public transparently. Putin also discussed the potential for a nuclear war in his remarks on Friday, saying that Russian nuclear doctrine doesn’t allow for a preventive strike and that in the case of all-out war, strikes against Russia would be “inevitable”, adding: However, nothing will remain of the enemy. Read the full story here: Relations between Moscow and Washington continue to remain “in a sorry state”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was cited by Russian state media as saying. Russian state-run news agency Tass quoted him as saying that the prisoner exchange of Viktor Bout for Brittney Griner should not be seen as a step towards improving US-Russia bilateral relations. Peskov was quoted as saying: The talks were exclusively on the topic of the exchange. It’s probably wrong to draw any hypothetical conclusions that this may be a step towards overcoming the crisis in bilateral relations. His comments came as Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said 30 more embassy staff would have to leave in the new year because of visa restrictions, according to state-owned news agency Ria. Echoing Peskov’s earlier comments, Antonov was quoted as saying that he did not see anything positive about the current state of bilateral ties. Russian diplomats spent months pushing for the release of a Russian assassin from German custody before finally agreeing to release the US basketball star Brittney Griner in exchange for the arms dealer Viktor Bout, according to US officials. Vadim Krasikov was sentenced to life in prison in Germany after being convicted of murdering the former Chechen fighter Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, in a park in Berlin in broad daylight in 2019. The killing sparked outrage in Germany and prompted the government to expel two Russian diplomats at the start of legal proceedings in December 2019, leading to a reciprocal response by Moscow. German authorities have said the killing was committed at the behest of Russia’s intelligence services. US officials have told the New York Times that Russia wanted Krasikov “as part of the deal” in exchange for releasing Griner and Paul Whelan, who remains in Russian detention. The paper writes that officials approached their German counterparts to see if they would consider freeing Krasikov, including exploring a sort of three-way deal that would give the Germans something in return. Here’s some more detail about the US’s new $275m military aid package for Ukraine, announced by the White House earlier. The new package will include weapons and artillery rounds, as well as equipment to help Ukraine boost its air defences, according to a statement by the US defence department. It will also include rockets for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (Himars) launchers, 155mm ammunition, Humvee military vehicles and generators, according to a document seen by Reuters and people familiar with the package. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. The UK’s ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward, said Russia is attempting to obtain more weapons from Iran, including hundreds of ballistic missiles. Moscow is offering Tehran an “unprecedented level” of military and technical support in return for it supplying weapons for the war in Ukraine, Woodward told reporters. Since August, Iran had transferred hundreds of drones – also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) – to Russia, which had used them to “kill civilians and illegally target civilian infrastructure” in Ukraine, she said. Woodward said: Russia is now attempting to obtain more weapons, including hundreds of ballistic missiles. In return, Russia is offering Iran an unprecedented level of military and technical support. We’re concerned that Russia intends to provide Iran with more advanced military components, which will allow Iran to strengthen their weapons capability. Speaking ahead of a meeting of the UN’s security council, she also said Britain was “almost certain that Russia is seeking to source weaponry from North Korea (and) other heavily sanctioned states, as their overstocks palpably dwindle”. The relationship between Moscow and Tehran is transforming into “a full-fledged defence partnership” with weapons and military expertise flowing in both directions, senior Biden administration officials told NBC News. The officials said Russia is looking to collaborate with Iran on weapons development, including possibly establishing a joint production line for drones in Russia. They added: This partnership poses a threat not just to Ukraine, but to Iran’s neighbours in the region. The US has announced fresh sanctions on dozens of people and entities over alleged human rights abuse or corruption across nine countries, including Russia, China and Iran. The latest sanctions list includes Russia’s Central Election Commission, which Washington accused of helping to oversee and monitor what the US said are “sham referendums” held in Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine, as well as 15 of its members. The US treasury department also took action against four people it accused of being directly involved in Russia’s filtration operations. The US state department designated two Russian nationals over alleged human rights abuse against Ukrainian civilians. Meanwhile, the White House said President Joe Biden had authorised $275m in military aid for Ukraine. Canada has imposed fresh sanctions on Russia, Iran and Myanmar over alleged human rights violations, its foreign ministry said. The measures included sanctions against 33 current or former senior Russian officials and six entities involved in alleged “systematic human rights violations” against Russian citizens who protested against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it said in a statement. Since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, Canada has imposed sanctions on more than 1,500 individuals and entities from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, said: There is more work to be done, but Canada will never stop standing up for human rights. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has warned that Russia is “expanding and modernising its nuclear arsenal” while President Vladimir Putin engages in “deeply irresponsible nuclear sabre-rattling”. Speaking at a ceremony at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, Austin said: As the Kremlin continues its cruel and unprovoked war of choice against Ukraine, the whole world has seen Putin engage in deeply irresponsible nuclear saber-rattling. Here’s the official order President Joe Biden signed commuting the notorious arms trafficker, Viktor Bout, as shared by CNN’s Kevin Liptak. The conditions of Bout’s commutation include that he not return to the US and not profit from any book or movie about his arrest or release. Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, discussed the latest Russian attacks on the country’s infrastructure in a phone call today, Downing Street said. Zelenskiy thanked the UK “for its crucial support to help restore power through the supply of generators” during the call, a No 10 spokesperson said. Sunak “paid tribute” to the success of Kyiv’s troops in “intercepting dozens of potentially devastating missiles” this week, they continued, and said the UK was “thinking of the Ukrainian people as they continued to defend their country through the winter”. They added: Updating on the latest lethal aid deliveries from the UK, the prime minister said that more anti-air guns and further short-range air defence missiles would arrive in the coming weeks. Both leaders agreed on the importance of pre-empting Russia’s insincere calls for a ceasefire and the prime minister added that the Kremlin needed to withdraw its forces before any agreement could be considered. The leaders agreed to speak again in the coming weeks, the spokesperson said. Zelenskiy tweeted about his call with Sunak: It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces have shelled the “entire front line” in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, has said. The fiercest fighting was near the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, he said, adding that Russian troops were also trying to advance near Lyman, which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in November. Vladimir Putin has said “ultimately an agreement will have to be reached” to end the conflict in Ukraine, but said he was wary of doing so following the Minsk agreements. Russia’s president also acknowledged that there had been some problems supplying equipment and clothes to the 300,000 men who were conscripted to fight in Ukraine in recent months. Putin also said Russia may cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the G7’s price cap on its oil. His comments came after the G7, the EU and Australia announced a $60-a-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil last week. Ukraine’s state-run power agency has accused Russian forces of abducting two senior Ukrainian staff at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Energoatom said the two abducted members of staff were beaten before being driven off in an “unknown direction” on Thursday. A third worker, who was detained, was responsible for safety at the plant, it said. Russian forces have installed multiple rocket launchers at Ukraine’s shut-down Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to Ukrainian officials. Energoatom said Russian forces occupying the plant have placed several Grad multiple rocket launchers near one of its six nuclear reactors, raising fears that Europe’s largest atomic power station could be used as a base to fire on Ukrainian territory and heightening radiation dangers. The UK Ministry of Defence has said Russia has likely received a resupply of Iranian Shahed-131 and 136 loitering munitions. Friday’s intelligence update comes following new reports over the past three weeks of attacks involving these devices. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian general staff reported shooting down at least 14 Shahed-136s. A Russian court has sentenced the opposition politician Ilya Yashin to eight and a half years in prison on charges of spreading false information meant to discredit the Russian army. The verdict marks the most high-profile case to date of a Russian dissident being jailed for opposing the invasion of Ukraine. Russia has told Zambia it pardoned a Zambian student to go and fight in Ukraine, where he was killed, according to the Zambian foreign affairs minister. Zambia has demanded answers over the death of Lemekhani Nyirenda, after Russia announced he had been killed on the battlefield in Ukraine in September. Representatives from Russia and the US met in Istanbul on Friday to discuss “difficult questions”, Russian state media reported. A US embassy spokesperson confirmed that a senior State department official met with Russian interlocutors to discuss “a narrow set of bilateral issues” that did not involve the war in Ukraine. A senior Orthodox Christian cleric has been accused of engaging in anti-Ukrainian activity by supporting Russian policies in social media posts, Ukraine’s security service (SBU) said. The SBU’s statement followed a series of raids of property used by a Ukrainian branch of the Orthodox church, including the 1,000-year-old Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex, as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”. Russian athletes have been offered a path to compete at the Paris 2024 Games even if the war in Ukraine continues to rage for another 18 months. It comes after a proposal was made by the Olympic Council of Asia to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to take part in its qualifying competitions for 2024 – even though they are still banned by most sports. The American basketball star Brittney Griner returned to the US early on Friday after being freed in a high-profile prisoner exchange from nearly 10 months in detention in Russia. Griner was seen getting off a plane at joint base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas, after she was swapped for the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Following his release from US detention, the notorious arms dealer, Viktor Bout, told RT that it was difficult to find the words to describe his feelings after being freed. Nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, Bout is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel who was serving a 25-year sentence for conspiring to sell tens of millions of dollars in weapons US officials said were to be used against Americans. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced in today’s Guardian that he will place new sanctions on 2,000 individuals and 400 entities across the world with connections to the Kremlin. “We are right to express our horror and revulsion, but our words will always count for more when they are backed by action,” Cleverly wrote. “I will ensure this remains the theme of British diplomacy. We are not passive observers and we should not merely voice our feelings: we will use our country’s leverage to make a difference.” Good afternoon from London. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today, here to bring you all the latest news from Ukraine. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. Vladimir Putin said Russia may cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the G7’s price cap on its oil. His comments came after the G7, the EU and Australia announced a $60 a barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil last week. Speaking to reporters, the Russian president said: I have already said that we simply will not sell to those countries that make such decisions. We will think, maybe even about the possible, if necessary … reduction in production. He described the west’s price cap move as “stupid” and that energy prices would “skyrocket” for those who imposed the caps. But he said Russia had an agreement with Opec+ about production, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility. He said: We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet. And concrete steps will be outlined in the decree of the president of Russia, which will be released in the next few days. Russian athletes have been offered a path to compete at the Paris 2024 Games even if the war in Ukraine continues to rage for another 18 months. It comes after a proposal was made by the Olympic Council of Asia to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to take part in its qualifying competitions for 2024 – even though they are still banned by most sports. The International Olympic Committee will now explore the OCA’s plan in the coming weeks, although it is widely expected to be approved. The decision is likely to be controversial, however the IOC has also made it clear that the sporting sanctions against Russia and Belarus as countries will remain in place. It means neither is able to host international events – while Russian and Belarusian athletes are banned from wearing the colours of their country, or having their anthems played, when they compete in international competitions. Russian athletes who show overt support for the war in Ukraine will also be denied a chance to compete. In a statement the IOC accepted there had been an “intense debate” at its 11th Olympic summit in Lausanne about the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. However it stressed that it wanted sport to continue to be a place where athletes from many different countries and political systems could come together. Read the full story here: Vladimir Putin said Russia would probably have to reach agreements regarding Ukraine in the future, but was wary of doing so following the Minsk agreements. Germany and France brokered ceasefire agreements in the Belarusian capital Minsk between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and 2015. Putin said the two countries had betrayed Russia, as they were now pumping Ukraine with weapons. The then German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said in an interview published in Germany’s Zeit magazine on Wednesday that the Minsk agreements had been an attempt to “give Ukraine time” to build up its defences. Putin said he was “disappointed” by Merkel’s comments. In his news conference today, Vladimir Putin vaguely acknowledged that there had been some problems supplying equipment and clothes to the 300,000 men who were conscripted to fight in Ukraine in recent months. He acknowledged the problem by saying that some of these issues were now easing. When a reporter asked Vladimir Putin for comment on a Russian court sentencing opposition politician Ilya Yashin to eight and a half years in prison for opposing the invasion of Ukraine, Putin responded: “Who is Yashin?” Putin continued by saying it was wrong to doubt a court’s decision. The official charge against Yashin was for spreading false information meant to discredit the Russian army. But Yashin was one of a small group of vocal opponents to the war who chose not to leave the country, saying earlier this year that he believed that “anti-war voices sound louder and more convincing if the person remains in Russia”. “I must remain in Russia, I must speak the truth loudly, and I must stop the bloodshed at any cost,” he said in a courtroom speech this week. “It physically pains me to think how many people have been killed in this war, how many lives have been ruined, and how many families have lost their homes. You cannot be indifferent. And I swear I do not regret anything.” Read more about Yashin here: Vladimir Putin has been speaking at a news conference in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, where he said further prisoner swaps between the US and Russia were possible. He has also vowed to wipe from the face of the earth any country that dared to attack Russia with nuclear weapons, and said there was no need to call up additional troops to fight in Ukraine. We’ll bring you more lines from the Russian leader’s news conference shortly. Ukraine’s state-run power agency, Energoatom, has accused Russian forces of abducting two senior Ukrainian staff at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-eastern Ukraine and detaining a third person. Energoatom said the two abducted members of staff were beaten before being driven off in an “unknown direction” on Thursday. A third worker, who was detained, was responsible for safety at the plant, it said. In a statement, it said: Through such actions, the occupiers are trying to gain loyalty from the courageous pro-Ukrainian staff ... Nevertheless, the invaders fail to do so because the personnel resist. Ukraine has accused Russia of putting pressure on Ukrainian employees at the plant, which was captured by Moscow’s troops soon after the invasion, to sign contracts with Russia’s nuclear energy company. It has not been possible to independently verify these claims. Earlier we reported that representatives from Russia and the US were meeting in Istanbul to discuss “difficult questions”. That meeting has finished and did not involve discussions about the war in Ukraine, according to a US embassy spokesperson. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, was cited by state-run media as saying that the meeting was between heads of department from the Russian foreign ministry and the US state department. He said it was a technical meeting and should not be seen as a sign the two sides were ready to resume discussing “major issues”. A US embassy spokesperson confirmed the meeting and said “a senior official from the state department was in Istanbul to meet with Russian interlocutors on a narrow set of bilateral issues”. They added: Russia’s war in Ukraine was not discussed. Russia has told Zambia it pardoned a Zambian student to go and fight in Ukraine, where he was killed, according to the Zambian foreign affairs minister, Stanley Kakubo. Zambia has demanded answers over the death of Lemekhani Nyirenda, a 23-year-old Zambian citizen, after Russia announced he had been killed on the battlefield in Ukraine in September. Kakubo said Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told him by telephone that Nyirenda was pardoned on 23 August to fight in Ukraine, in exchange for an amnesty. He said: We were informed that Russia allows for prisoners to be provided an opportunity for pardon in exchange for participation in the special military operation. Nyirenda’s father said he was “conscripted” to fight while serving nine years in a jail on the outskirts of Moscow for a drug offence. The Moscow Engineering Physics Institute student was working as a part-time courier when an unknown person handed him a package containing drugs, his father told Reuters. Kakubo said Nyirenda’s remains had arrived in Moscow on Friday and were expected in Zambia on Sunday. He added that Russia had told Zambia that money owed to Nyirenda, together with all the documentation relating to his amnesty, recruitment and death, would be handed to a Zambian representative who would accompany the body. Russian businessman and Putin ally, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said last month that Nyirenda had been fighting for his Wagner private military group. Russia has offered freedom to some prisoners in exchange for fighting in its war in Ukraine. A Russian court has sentenced the opposition politician Ilya Yashin to eight and a half years in prison, in the most high-profile case to date of a Russian dissident being jailed for opposing the invasion of Ukraine. A veteran of Russia’s anti-Putin opposition, Yashin was one of a small group of vocal opponents to the war who chose not to leave the country, saying earlier this year that he believed that “anti-war voices sound louder and more convincing if the person remains in Russia”. In a courtroom speech this week, Yashin said: I must remain in Russia, I must speak the truth loudly, and I must stop the bloodshed at any cost. It physically pains me to think how many people have been killed in this war, how many lives have been ruined, and how many families have lost their homes. You cannot be indifferent. And I swear I do not regret anything. He added: It’s better to spend 10 years behind bars as an honest man than quietly burn with shame over the blood spilled by your government. Yashin joins a small group of other prominent dissenters who have been imprisoned for speaking out against the war. In July, a Russian city councillor was sentenced to seven years in prison after he spoke critically of a children’s drawing contest. “What kind of children’s drawing contest can we talk about for Children’s Day … when we have children dying every day?” he had said, the key piece of evidence against him in the trial. Vladimir Kara-Murza, another veteran opposition member, has also been charged with spreading false information about the army. Some media reports say he has also been charged with treason. Read the full story here: Representatives from Russia and the US are meeting in Istanbul today to discuss “difficult questions”, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported. The two sides are set to discuss “irritants” in bilateral relations including visas, embassy staffing levels and the work of each side’s institutions and agencies abroad, among other unspecified issues, the report said. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, confirmed the meeting during a discussion in Moscow. He was cited by Tass as saying: Yes, it is true that a meeting is being held today in Istanbul at the level of the directors of relevant departments. In principle, this event is held periodically to discuss so-called irritants in bilateral relations. After a certain pause, we resumed communication with the Americans in person on this issue. The allusion to “irritants” means that they are discussing the technicalities of how the US diplomatic missions in Russia and Russian ones in the US function. A senior Orthodox Christian cleric has been accused of engaging in anti-Ukrainian activity by supporting Russian policies in social media posts, Ukraine’s security service (SBU) said. In a statement, it said an archbishop in a diocese in western Ukraine had distributed posts that “humiliated the national honour and dignity of Ukrainians” and “contributed to the incitement of religious enmity and hatred”, Reuters reports. The cleric, who was not named, was accused of using an anonymous profile on Facebook to spread “narratives of Russian propagandists”. The SBU’s statement followed a series of raids of property used by a Ukrainian branch of the Orthodox church, including the 1,000-year-old Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex, as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”. A spokesperson for the church said last week that it had always acted within the framework of Ukrainian law and that the state had no legal grounds to put pressure on its followers. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he would speak to his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts in order to strengthen the UN-backed Black Sea grain deal. Erdoğan said he would speak to Vladimir Putin on Saturday, and Volodymyr Zelenskiy separately, during an address at a conference in Istanbul today. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The jailed Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has described the sentencing of Ilya Yashin as “another shameless and lawless verdict” that will not silence his long-time ally. In a series of tweets, Navalny said he had known Yashin since he was a teenager and that he was “proud” of his friend. A Moscow court has sentenced opposition politician Ilya Yashin to eight and a half years in prison for spreading “fake information” about the Russian army. Yashin, 39, was found guilty of spreading “false information” on a YouTube video released in April in which he discussed evidence uncovered by western journalists of Russian war crimes in Bucha, near Kyiv. In the video, the Kremlin critic and former municipal deputy cast doubt on the official Moscow version that such reports had been fabricated as a “provocation” against Russia. Sentencing him, the judge, Oksana Goryunova of the Meshchansky district court, said Yashin had committed a crime by disseminating “knowingly false information about Russia’s armed forces”. In his final statement to the court this week, Yashin appealed directly to President Vladimir Putin, describing him as “the person responsible for this slaughter” and asking him to “stop this madness”. He said: As if they will sew my mouth shut and I would be forbidden to speak forever. Everyone understands that this is the point. He added: I am isolated from society because they want me to be silent. I promise as long as I’m alive I’ll never will be. My mission is to tell the truth. I will not give up the truth even behind bars. After all, quoting the classic: ‘Lie is the religion of slaves.’ An ally of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, Yashin is one of hundreds of Russians to face prosecution under new laws that criminalise disseminating information about Russia’s military operation in Ukraine that clash with the Kremlin’s narrative. Moscow and Washington will continue to talk about possible prisoner swaps directly, without intermediaries, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, was cited by the state-owned news agency Ria Novosti as saying. President Joe Biden yesterday expressed regret that the US had not been able to secure the release of the detained American, Paul Whelan, after news that Brittney Griner had been freed as part of a prisoner exchange for the arms dealer Viktor Bout. Biden said: For totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up. When Nazar and his fellow soldiers came to the village outside the key city of Bakhmut that they had been ordered to attack, they thought they would be there for a single day. They arrived without sleeping bags or extra rations, as snow lay on the ground. Instead of the 15 Russians they had been warned to expect, they encountered 50 of them, dug into the tree line, triggering a fight that lasted several days. “In places we were only 100 metres apart,” recalls Nazar. We were on one low hill and they were on another. Sometimes, we could even hear their laughter. For the 19-year-old machine gunner in the 24th mechanised brigade, it was his first fight since finishing his training. For many of the other soldiers in this battalion, however, it was only the latest in a series of battles that has seen them fight in the Donbas region in Popasna, in the battle for Kherson and then around Bakhmut, the embattled eastern city that is currently the war’s most violent front. Even 5 miles (8km) from Bakhmut, back from the frontlines, the sound of heavy rockets and artillery is constant in a frozen landscape where all the roads are covered in a glazing of sheet ice. It is here on this frontline that the Russians have spent almost six months trying to break through to reach the cities of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Konstantinovka in warfare that is being fought from frigid muddy trenches, and where the combatants must now slog through the fields and the dense woods of Ukraine’s east. While there are still civilians in towns and villages surrounding Bakhmut, a city under attack from two directions that was once home to 72,0000 people, evidence of the scale of the continuing battle is everywhere. Read the full story here: The notorious arms dealer, Viktor Bout, has spoken in an interview following his release from US detention in a prisoner exchange for the basketball star, Brittney Griner. Speaking to the Russian state-run news outlet RT, Bout said it was difficult to find the words to describe his feelings after being freed. He added that he had not encountered much anti-Russian sentiment during his imprisonment in the US, and claimed that many of his fellow prisoners had sympathies with Moscow. Nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, Bout is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel who the US justice department once described as one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers. He was serving a 25-year sentence for conspiring to sell tens of millions of dollars in weapons US officials said were to be used against Americans. His wife, Alla Bout, said he felt terrible and “exhausted” after his long prisoner swap journey and hadn’t slept for three days, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. She was quoted as saying: Viktor Anatolyevich feels terrible, he is really exhausted. She added that she hoped the US will hand over his documents and drawings to the Russian embassy, adding that she was grateful for how the Americans treated her husband during the exchange. She said: He said he was grateful to the American side for feeding him. He said he hasn’t eaten as much for the last 12 years. He was treated well, with respect, he wasn’t shackled or in handcuffs. A plane carrying the US basketball star, Brittney Griner, has landed in the US. Griner was freed in a prisoner exchange after nearly 10 months of detention in Russia. The two-time Olympic gold medalist was swapped for for the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Russian forces have shelled the “entire front line” in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, has said. The fiercest fighting was near the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Reuters quotes him as saying in an interview on Friday. Five civilians were killed and two injured in Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk over the previous day, he said. He added that Russian troops were also trying to advance near Lyman, which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in November. In Bakhmut and other parts of the Donetsk region neighbouring the Luhansk province, Ukraine countered with barrages from rocket launchers, a witness said. Kyiv’s forces attacked Russian positions and troop assembly points in at least half a dozen towns in the south of Ukraine, Ukraine’s general staff said in an update this morning. Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said in a social media post: The Russians have intensified their efforts in Donetsk and Luhansk. They are now in a very active phase of attempting to conduct offensive operations. We are advancing nowhere but, rather, defending, destroying the enemy’s infantry and equipment wherever it tries to advance. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Vivian Ho to bring you the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Russian forces have installed multiple rocket launchers at Ukraine’s shut-down Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, raising fears that Europe’s largest atomic power station could be used as a base to fire on Ukrainian territory and heightening radiation dangers. This comes as the UK Ministry of Defence says in its latest intelligence report that Russia has likely received a resupply of Iranian Shahed-131 and 136 loitering munitions, with new reports over the past three weeks of attacks involving these devices. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian general staff reported shooting down at least 14 Shahed-136s, while on Wednesday, Ukrainian officials reported the use of Iranian-provided one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles to attack the Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro oblasts. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced in today’s Guardian that he will place new sanctions on 2,000 individuals and 400 entities across the world with connections to the Kremlin. “We are right to express our horror and revulsion, but our words will always count for more when they are backed by action,” Cleverly wrote. “I will ensure this remains the theme of British diplomacy. We are not passive observers and we should not merely voice our feelings: we will use our country’s leverage to make a difference.” In that same vein, the US is set to levy fresh sanctions against Russia and China on Friday, according to the Wall Street Journal reports, with measures intended on targeting Russia’s deployment of Iranian drones in Ukraine, as well as alleged human-rights abuses by Russia. The war’s most violent front is currently situated in the area of Bakhmut, an embattled city in the eastern Donetsk region. Here, three civilians died yesterday, with one more killed in Toretsk and another in Netailovo. Meanwhile in Moscow, firefighters are battling a blaze the size of a football pitch at a shopping centre. However, the suspected cause of the fire is arson and authorities currently believe it has nothing to do with Ukraine. After almost months in Russian detention, US basketball star Brittney Griner was freed in a dramatic high-level prisoner exchange for the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, the so-called “Merchant of Death” who had been held in a US prison for 12 years. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was arrested in February at a Moscow airport after Russian authorities said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage. She pleaded guilty in July, saying in court that she had no criminal intent and the canisters’ presence in her luggage was due to hasty packing. Her family and supporters repeatedly decried the charges against her as politically motivated; in May, the US designated her as unlawfully detained. Here is video of the prisoner exchange in Abu Dhabi: Russian landmines continue to put Ukrainian lives at risk, with civilians attempting to return to some form of normalcy in some areas, only to find that danger still persists. Now almost 10 months into the invasion, more than a fourth of the country needs to be checked for mines. Volodymyr Zelenskiy last night paid tribute to four policemen killed by landmines in the Kherson oblast, calling the landmines left behind by Russian troops “perhaps even fiercer and more devious than missile terror”. Ukrainian and Russian forces are now battling it out in the Donetsk region, with the embattled city of Bakhmut seeing the most violence and fighting. “In places we were only 100 metres apart,” one Ukrainian soldier recalled, of a days-long skirmish in a village outside of Bakhmut. “We were on one low hill and they were on another. Sometimes, we could even hear their laughter.” The Guardian’s Peter Beaumont has more from what is now currently the war’s most violent front: Ukraine’s ministry of defence believes that up to 310 Russian soldiers were killed in Ukraine yesterday: A 40-year-old man has died of injuries sustained in yesterday’s rocket attacks on the Kharkiv oblast, Vasily Golubev, the region’s governor, said on Telegram. Russian forces injured three others after launching rocket and artillery strikes on the Kupyan, Kharkiv, Chuguyiv and Izyum districts, damaging houses and cars. Russian shelling burned down the warehouses of a food enterprise in the city of Kupyansk, The Guardian’s chief culture writer, Charlotte Higgins, went on the Guardian’s Today in Focus to discuss how the war has changed Ukraine’s culture while Ukrainian artist Oleksiy Sai talked to the Guardian’s Hannah Moore about how he sees the work he produces not as art, but a tactical weapon. Here are some of the latest images we have received from around Ukraine: From the Guardian’s chief culture writer, Charlotte Higgins: I spent two eventful weeks in Ukraine in October, punctuated by major cruise missile attacks on Kyiv and then the start of the current campaign of drone attacks on energy infrastructure. Happily that didn’t stop me undertaking the reporting I had gone there to do – which was talking to artists – poets, playwrights, dancers, composers, visual artists, musicians – about how they were using their work in all kinds of ways during the current conflict as a means of resistance. Sometimes that means refusing to stop working – the National Opera of Ukraine, for example, reopened soon after the Russian withdrawal from Kyiv as an amazing symbol of resilience. Other artists have used their skills as part of the war effort, producing campaigning work that sits on the edge of propaganda, aimed at a western audience; others have found themselves recording, witnessing and testifying through their writing; others have found moving and poetic ways to respond to the violence and rupture that war brings. All of this is against the backdrop of Putin’s insistence that Ukraine does not have a culture of its own, but exists only in relation to Russia – meaning the underlying motivation for the invasion is, in the end, about identity and culture. Here, I explore the surprising and fascinating upsurge in Ukrainian poetry engendered by the war. In its latest intelligence report, the UK Ministry of Defence says Russia has likely received a resupply of Iranian Shahed-131 and 136 loitering munitions, with new reports over the past three weeks of attacks involving these devices. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian general staff reported shooting down at least 14 Shahed-136s, while on Wednesday, Ukrainian officials reported the use of Iranian-provided one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles to attack the Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro oblasts. The last reported takedown of a Shahed-136 in Ukraine was on 17 November. Russian forces shelled the region of Kherson 68 times yesterday, targeting residential homes and apartment buildings, said Yaroslav Yanushevych, the regional governor. Eight civilians were injured in the attacks. Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks on the Donetsk oblast yesterday, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the Donetsk oblast, said in his morning update on casualties. Three were killed in the besieged city of Bakhmut, one in Toretsk and another in Netailovo. Two more were injured, Kyrylenko said. The US is set to levy fresh sanctions against Russia and China on Friday, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing officials familiar with the matter. The measures will target Russia’s deployment of Iranian drones in Ukraine, as well as alleged human-rights abuses by Russia. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced in today’s Guardian that he will place new sanctions on individuals in Russia. In an opinion piece titled, “Britain is not a passive observer on the world stage. We want oligarchs and dictators to fear us”, Cleverly writes: After Vladimir Putin launched his latest onslaught against Ukraine in February, the UK put together the biggest package of sanctions ever enacted against a major economy. So far we have targeted over 1,200 Russian individuals, including at least 100 oligarchs and their families, with a net worth exceeding £140bn. We’ve hit whole sectors of the Russian economy, immobilising Russian central bank reserves, preventing Russian companies from raising funds in the City of London, and placing UK financial services beyond the Kremlin’s reach. Together with allies, our sanctions have undermined Russia’s ability to wage war. Today, I will announce new sanctions on individuals in 11 countries, including Iran, Russia, Mali and Nicaragua, targeting those responsible for acts of torture, sexual violence and the repression of protests. Meanwhile in Moscow, firefighters are battling a blaze the size of a football pitch at a shopping centre, emergency services say. The fire broke out overnight at the Mega Khimki mall in the northern suburb of Khimki. The suspected cause of the fire is arson, according to authorities, and there were no immediate reports of casualties. Mega had been home to a large number of western retail chains before the companies’ departure from Russiaamid the Ukraine conflict, including one of the first Ikea stores in the area. In his late Thursday video address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenksiy, paid tribute to four policemen killed by landmines in Kherson province. “This is perhaps even fiercer and more devious than missile terror,” said Zelenksiy. “For there is no system against mines that could destroy at least part of the threat as our anti-aircraft systems do.” He accused Russian forces of leaving landmines, tripwire mines, mined buildings, cars and infrastructure in places they abandoned under Ukrainian military pressure. Russian forces have installed multiple rocket launchers at Ukraine’s shut-down Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials claimed Thursday, raising fears Europe’s largest atomic power station could be used as a base to fire on Ukrainian territory and heightening radiation dangers. Ukraine’s nuclear company Energoatom said in a statement that Russian forces occupying the plant have placed several Grad multiple rocket launchers near one of its six nuclear reactors. It said the offensive systems are located at new “protective structures” the Russians secretly built, “violating all conditions for nuclear and radiation safety.” The claims have not been verified by the Guardian. Although the risk of a nuclear meltdown is greatly reduced because all six reactors have been shut down, experts have said a dangerous release of radiation is still possible, the Associated Press reports. This is the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Our top story this morning is that Russian forces have installed multiple rocket launchers at Ukraine’s shut-down Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials claimed Thursday, raising fears Europe’s largest atomic power station could be used as a base to fire on Ukrainian territory and heightening radiation dangers. We’ll have more on this shortly. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: US basketball star Brittney Griner has been released in a prisoner swap with Russia in exchange for former arms dealer Viktor Bout and was heading back to the United States on Thursday, ending what President Joe Biden called months of “hell” for her and her wife. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Thursday the United States is confident that Finland and Sweden will be approved soon for membership of Nato despite ratification delays from members Turkey and Hungary. After meeting his Finnish and Swedish counterparts on Thursday, Blinken said both countries had proved their bona fides to join the alliance, most notably in joining Nato to provide support to Ukraine to counter Russia’s invasion. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukrainian energy systems despite global criticism of strikes that have left millions without electricity and water at the start of winter. The Russian leader presented the strikes as a response to the explosion on Moscow’s bridge that connected Russia to annexed Crimea, as well as other attacks, accusing Kyiv of blowing up power lines near the Kursk nuclear power plant and not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Russia is still set on seizing parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that Putin claimed as his own, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. He added that the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Russia annexed in 2014, was vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian forces, after officials there said they had shot down a drone near a key naval base. The United States is preparing to send Ukraine a $275m military aid package offering new capabilities to defeat drones and strengthen air defenses, according to a document seen by Reuters on Thursday and people familiar with the package. Russian shelling of a town in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine has left one person dead and two injured, according to the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. At least 12 houses were destroyed by the shelling in the town of Toretsk, he said in a Telegram post. About 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to a Ukrainian official. Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament, said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid during the war. The grid is still working despite taking major damage, a senior official said. Volodymyr Kudrytsky, the chief executive of the grid operator Ukrenergo, also told a meeting arranged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that his officials were scouring the world for the complex equipment needed for repairs. Ukraine has introduced new emergency power cuts as it tries to repair energy infrastructure damaged in Russian airstrikes. The grid operator Ukrenergo said the situation was complicated by the weather, with western regions facing frost, rain, snow and strong winds that were causing wires to ice over, but the most difficult situation was in eastern areas, where fighting has been fiercest. Russian troops are reportedly taking part in tactical exercises in Belarus, according to the Russian defence ministry. Video clips posted by the ministry showed Russian soldiers in snow gear training near tanks in a winter landscape, firing weapons including artillery. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups. Pope Francis broke down and wept as he prayed for peace in Ukraine during a traditional Christmas visit to the Spanish Steps in Rome. Reuters reports that Francis had to stop speaking and was unable to continue for about 30 seconds, and his head trembled.

Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus Energy, said his company did not know yet how much bills would rise in the run-up to 7 February, the deadline for when the regulator Ofgem sets a new cap on what suppliers can charge customers. The record wholesale gas prices across Europe has led to forecasts that average annual bills in the UK could leap from £1,277 to more than £2,000 when the cap comes into effect in April. Jackson said talks between energy suppliers and the government would have to find a way to avoid global gas prices being passed directly on to consumers. “We’ve got to recognise that as a result of the pandemic, every sector is asking the Treasury for help and there’s not an infinite supply of money,” he said. “The reality is that the UK buys most of its energy on a global market and we’ve had to pay about £20bn more than usual this year. So, in some way or another, the UK is going to have to pay that money.” Octopus, a renewable energy provider, is one of the fastest-growing companies in the sector, with 3.1m customers. It has been at the heart of industry talks with business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who is said to be determined to avoid bailing out large energy companies. Jackson has been a leading proponent of an alternative £20bn loan scheme, under which a commercial lender makes a fund available that suppliers can dip into in order to refrain from hitting customers with sudden hikes in their energy bills. The suppliers could then pay the lender back over time with the money they make from staggered price increases, cushioning the blow to household finances. Jackson said the sector should explore the plan, which may need government oversight but not necessarily any state funding, “before we go looking for help from the public purse or elsewhere”. “The energy sector has always had large access to private finance,” he added. Asked whether a windfall tax should be imposed on North Sea oil companies that have made money from higher gas prices to help fund lower bills, Jackson refused to dismiss the idea. He added that it should be separate from broader efforts to reduce household bills. The expectation of rising gas bills adds to wider fears that 2022 will be characterised by a massive squeeze on the cost of living that could push more people into poverty and upend British politics. UK households face a hit of £1,200 this year, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, with more expensive energy bills piled on top of rising taxes and the effect of stalling wage increases."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-us-denounces-putins-loose-talk-on-nuclear-weapons-zelenskiy-reports-fierce-fighting-in-bakhmut","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-08T18:45:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv ‘working with UN to demilitarise Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-us-denounces-putins-loose-talk-on-nuclear-weapons-zelenskiy-reports-fierce-fighting-in-bakhmut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-us-denounces-putins-loose-talk-on-nuclear-weapons-zelenskiy-reports-fierce-fighting-in-bakhmut","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv ‘working with UN to demilitarise Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant’ – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s coming up to 9pm in Kyiv.

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his government was working with the UN’s nuclear watchdog agency to create a safety zone around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Kyiv remained “in close contact” with Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), he said at a joint press conference with his Slovak counterpart, Rastislav Káčer, in Kyiv. Russia has claimed that its proposed safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is to “stop Ukrainian shelling”. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, also said the US’s withdrawal from a treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles was a “destructive” act that created a vacuum and stoked additional security risks. Russian shelling of a town in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine has left one person dead and two injured, according to the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko.

Russia freed the jailed US basketball star Brittney Griner on Thursday in a high-level prisoner exchange for the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, who had been held in a US prison for 12 years. Joe Biden, who had made Griner’s release a top priority after she spent almost 10 months in jail on drugs charges, said in an address from the White House that he had spoken with Griner and found her “in good spirits”. The mother of Viktor Bout has thanked Vladimir Putin for her son’s release as part of a swap with the US. Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel whom the US justice department once described as one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers. Russian state media reported that he had arrived back in the country. Biden expressed regret that the deal did not include Paul Whelan, an American jailed since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government say are baseless. An anonymous US official told CNN that leaving Whelan out of the deal had been “a difficult decision” but “it was a choice to get Brittney or nothing”. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups.

Reuters reports that Francis had to stop speaking and was unable to continue for about 30 seconds, and his head trembled. He later tweeted that “peace is possible; disarmament is possible”. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine, including of the village of Posad-Pokrovske, in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region. The notorious arms dealer, Viktor Bout, has arrived back in Russia after his release from US detention in a prisoner swap with Brittney Griner, Russian state media reported. The White House has said the grant of clemency for Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, was not approved until today. Russian shelling of a town in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine has left one person dead and two injured, according to the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. At least 12 houses were destroyed by the shelling in the town of Toretsk, he said in a Telegram post. Kyrylenko wrote: 1 person was killed, 2 more were wounded in artillery shelling of Toretsk. Shells hit a private sector, destroying and damaging at least 12 houses. The Russians are again cynically shelling civilians — they are continuing their terror tactics. The mother of the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout has thanked Vladimir Putin for her son’s release as part of a swap with the US. Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel whom the US justice department once described as one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers. He was serving a 25-year sentence for conspiring to sell tens of millions of dollars worth of weapons that US officials said were to be used against Americans. He was released from US detention in a prisoner swap for the American basketball star Brittney Griner. He is expected to arrive in Moscow shortly. The release happened “thanks to our president”, Raisa Bout said in televised remarks reported by AFP. She said: I am so grateful. A low maternal bow to the Russian foreign ministry with Lavrov Sergei Viktorovich at its helm. She said she was also grateful to “kind people” in the US, adding: “You cannot say that all of them are evil.” Russia’s human rights commissioner, Tatiana Moskalkova, described Bout as a “wonderful man who has become a victim of American insinuations”. The US basketball star Brittney Griner has been released from a Russian jail and is on her way back to the US, President Joe Biden said. The Russian foreign ministry said it had traded Griner for Viktor Bout, a notorious arms dealer who had been held in a US prison for 12 years. The swap took place at an airport in Abu Dhabi, Russian news agencies reported. Griner, 32, a two-time Olympic gold medallist, was arrested on 17 February. Talks to secure her release were complicated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February and the subsequent souring of ties between Washington and Moscow. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his government was working with the UN’s nuclear watchdog agency to create a safety zone around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Kyiv remained “in close contact” with Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), he said at a joint press conference with his Slovak counterpart, Rastislav Káčer, in Kyiv. Kuleba said: Of course, we are all interested in ensuring that all nuclear power plants, not only the Zaporizhzhia NPP, are safe. This is extremely difficult to achieve without stopping Russian missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine, but we are moving forward step by with mutual understanding with the IAEA. There is a rule in diplomacy that nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed. Ukraine’s state nuclear energy firm Energoatom earlier today repeated Kyiv’s claims that Russia was using the site as a de facto weapons depot. Energoatom said Russia had brought multiple rocket launchers to the site and stationed them near the plant’s power unit No 6. It went on to claim that Russian forces planned to use them to launch attacks against Ukrainian positions and bridges on the western bank of the Dnipro River. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has come under repeated shelling since Moscow seized it shortly after launching its invasion in February, prompting the IAEA to call for a demilitarised safety zone around the plant. Earlier, we reported that Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukraine’s energy grid and presented the strikes as a response to the explosion on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea in October. “Yes, we do that,” Putin said of the strikes on the Ukraine grid. “But who started it?” Here’s a clip of Putin speaking while attending a military awards ceremony in the Kremlin today: Pope Francis broke down and wept as he prayed for peace in Ukraine during a traditional Christmas visit to the Spanish Steps in Rome. The pope’s voice began to tremble as he mentioned the suffering of Ukrainians. He said: I would have liked to have brought you the thanks of the Ukrainian people … Reuters reports that Francis had to stop speaking and was unable to continue for about 30 seconds, and his head trembled. The crowd, which included the mayor of Rome, Roberto Gualtieri, applauded when they realised he was unable to talk and saw him crying. When he resumed the prayer, his voice was cracking. He continued: …the Ukrainian people for the peace we have so long asked the Lord. Instead I must present you with the pleas of children, elderly, mothers and fathers and the young people of that martyred land, that is suffering so much. He later tweeted that “peace is possible; disarmament is possible”. It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, I’ll be bringing you all the latest global developments on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The commodities trading firm Trafigura is to hand more than $1.7bn to its top traders and shareholders after the energy crisis, fuelled by the war in Ukraine, led to a surge in profits. Trafigura, one of the world’s largest specialist commodity traders, posted a record $7bn net profit in its last financial year, more than the previous four years combined, after making gains from the market volatility caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Its chief financial officer, Christophe Salmon, hailed an “exceptionally strong year” as profits more than doubled and revenues grew to $318.5bn in the year to 30 September, up from $231.3bn a year earlier. The $1.71bn payout to its 1,100 shareholders, including top employees, equates to about $1.56m a head if shared equally. That’s an increase of about 35% compared with 2021’s dividend of $1.12bn to about 1,000 top traders and investors. Oil and gas companies, as well as some electricity generators, have faced windfall taxes as a result of the gains made since the invasion. However, politicians have not moved to curb the profits of commodity traders. Strong trading performances have boosted multinationals including the British oil firms BP and Shell. Read the full story here: Speaking earlier, Joe Biden said Russia was treating the case of the detained American Paul Whelan “differently” but that the US “will never give up” on securing his release. Biden said: Sadly and for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up. The Biden administration has offered Moscow multiple options to secure Whelan, a US official told journalists today. From the Washington Post’s John Hudson: And from Nick Schifrin from PBS: Explosions have been heard at Berdiansk airbase in the Zaporizhzhia region. Three large explosions were heard, as well as smaller ones, near the city on the coast of the Sea of Azov. Emergency services have been reported as making their way to the scene. No casualties have been reported. Russia has used the 35th anniversary of the historic signing of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) to criticise the US for withdrawing from the agreement in 2019. At the time, the then US president Donald Trump gave his reason for doing so as “developing our own military response options,” to Russia’s missiles. Nato allies later backed the US by issuing a statement attributing responsibility for the treaty’s demise to Russia. When the treaty was signed in 1987, the agreement between the US and the Soviet Union to reduce their nuclear arsenals was hailed by some commentators as a significant step towards a non-nuclear world. This is how the Guardian reported the historic event. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukrainian energy systems despite global criticism of strikes that have left millions without electricity and water at the start of winter. “There’s a lot of noise about our strikes on the energy infrastructure of a neighbouring country. Yes, we do that. But who started it?” Putin said at an awards ceremony in the Kremlin, according to Agence France-Presse, adding that the criticism would “not interfere with our combat missions”. He presented the strikes as a response to a blast on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea and other attacks, accusing Kyiv of blowing up power lines from the Kursk nuclear power plant and not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. “Not supplying water to a city of more than a million people is an act of genocide,” Putin said. He accused the west of “complete silence” on this and of bias against Russia. “As soon as we move and do something in response, there is uproar and clamour spreading through the whole universe,” he said. Russia has faced claims that its attacks on Ukraine’s energy systems and infrastructure amount to war crimes. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. The EU’s ninth set of restrictive measures on Russia since February’s invasion of Ukraine seek to close gaps in previous rounds, with further sanctions on 169 entities “which might contribute to the technological enhancement of Russia’s defence and security sector”, according to a draft text seen by the Guardian. These companies will face restrictions on their ability to buy from Europe so-called dual-use goods – civilian products that can be turned to military purposes. Previous EU sanctions have already imposed sweeping bans on hi-tech equipment, but this package adds items that were missed off the list such as generators, toy drones, laptops, cameras and lenses. According to a separate paper, four pro-Kremlin TV companies will lose their licence to broadcast in the EU, including NTV, Rossiya 1, Pervyi Kanal and REN TV, home to some of Russia’s high-profile talkshows featuring strident pro-war commentators. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, meaning a travel ban and freeze on any assets held in the EU, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups. In a largely symbolic move, six entities will see any EU assets frozen, including nationalist groups such as the Russian Imperial Legion, the Russian Imperial Movement and Taskforce Rusich. Unlike previous rounds of sanctions, the cost for EU countries is relatively small. Some ideas, such as a ban on the once lucrative trade in Russian diamonds, are conspicuous by their absence. The measures now have to be agreed by all 27 member states before coming into force. Speaking at the White House, Joe Biden formally announced the release of Brittney Griner from detention in Russia and pledged to continue working to bring home another American jailed in the country. “Moments ago, standing together with her wife, Cherelle, in the Oval Office, I spoke with Brittney Griner,” Biden said. She’s safe, she’s on a plane, she’s on her way home after months of being unjustly detained in Russia, held under intolerable circumstances. Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones, and she should have been there all along. He thanked officials in his administration who had worked for her release, as well as the United Arab Emirates, “because that’s where she landed”. The president said “the past few months have been hell” for Griner, her family and her teammates. He also mentioned the case of Paul Whelan, another American, whose release from Russia he said he was working on. “We’ve not forgotten about Paul Whelan, who’s been unjustly detained in Russia for years.” For live developments on the release of Griner, do follow our US politics live blog with my colleague Chris Stein: Around 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament. Konenenko said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Kononenko said: These are the total number of confirmed people who are classed as ‘missing under special circumstances’, we do not have the exact figures. Russia has not given the International Committee for the Red Cross access [to the information]. Though the ICRC has not been given full access, it has been able to visit some Ukrainian prisoners. On Thursday, the ICRC made a rare announcement that it had visited one Russian facility and that it planned to visit another this week. “ICRC teams are reaching out to families of prisoners of war to share updates from their loved ones. Most updates are short notes of love and personal news,” read the ICRC statement. In July, Oleh Kotenko, who is in charge of wartime missing people within the Ukrainian ministry for the occupied territories, put the total number of Ukrainian service personnel believed to be held by Russia at significantly less – 7,200. Kotenko said that although Ukraine had not heard from some of those reported missing, they were believed to be alive and in captivity. After Ukraine pushed Russian forces out of parts of Kharkiv and Kherson region, it has announced several prisoner swaps. The regularity of the swaps probably indicate that Ukraine detained Russian prisoners during their offensives. The former US marine Paul Whelan is still in Russian custody, his lawyer said, after news that Brittney Griner was released in a prisoner swap with the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Dialogue on a possible prisoner swap for Whelan is ongoing, his lawyer said. Whelan was convicted by a Russian court in 2020 on espionage charges and sentenced to 16 years in a Russian high-security prison. He denied the charges. Joe Biden has tweeted that he has spoken to Brittney Griner, following the announcement that she has been released from Russian detention. In a tweet, he posted pictures of him meeting with Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, at the White House. The US basketball star Brittney Griner has been released from Russian detention in a prisoner swap for the convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout, US officials have confirmed. Griner was sentenced to nine years behind bars in Russia after being convicted on drug charges. A two-time Olympic gold medallist and champion, she was arrested on 17 February, a week before Russia sent troops into Ukraine, at a Moscow airport while in possession of vape cartridges containing cannabis oil, which is banned in Russia. Bout, known as “the merchant of death”, was one of the world’s most wanted men before his 2008 arrest on multiple charges related to arms trafficking. For almost two decades, he was one of the world’s most notorious arms dealers, selling weaponry to rogue states, rebel groups and murderous warlords in Africa, Asia and South America. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The Kremlin has said the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Russia annexed in 2014, was vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian forces after officials there said they had shot down a drone near a key naval base. The Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol, the largest city in annexed Crimea, said this morning that Russia’s fleet shot down a Ukrainian drone over the Black Sea. Speaking to reporters during his regular briefing, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: There are certainly risks because the Ukrainian side continues its policy of organising terrorist attacks. But, on the other hand, information we get indicates that effective countermeasures are being taken. His comments came after President Vladimir Putin recently made a visit to the Kerch bridge, the key link between annexed Crimea and mainland Russia which was partially destroyed by an explosion in October. The Russian-installed head of occupied Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said last month that he had ordered “fortification works to ensure the safety of Crimeans” to be built on the peninsula after recent attacks. Speaking during his briefing with reporters today, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia is still set on seizing parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that President Vladimir Putin claimed as his own. The Russian leader announced he had annexed four Ukrainian regions – Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk – after holding fake referendums in order to claim a mandate for his territorial claims. However Moscow does not have full control of any of the four provinces of Ukraine it says it annexed, and Peskov appeared to set a limit on the Ukrainian territory that Russia now sought to claim. Asked whether Russia planned to incorporate any more territories beyond the four regions, he replied: There is no question of that. At least, there have been no statements in this regard. But there is nevertheless a lot of work ahead to liberate the territories; in a number of new regions of the Russian Federation there are occupied territories that have to be liberated. I mean part of the Donetsk Republic, as well as what became part of the Russian Federation, and then was re-occupied by Ukrainian troops. My colleague Peter Beaumont is in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, amid worsening wintry conditions. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has called on Russia to answer for “atrocities” committed by its forces in Ukraine. Thomas-Greenfield was responding to a report by the UN’s human rights office, published yesterday, that found that at least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights documented summary executions and attacks in dozens of towns across three regions, and warned the actual number of victims in the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions was likely to be much higher. The report covered the beginning of Moscow’s invasion on 24 February until early April, and gathered evidence from 102 towns and villages in Ukraine. It said: The acts in question were committed by Russian armed forces in control of these areas and led to the deaths of 441 civilians (341 men, 72 women, 20 boys and 8 girls). Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report said. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in what it calls a “special military operation”. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said the US’s withdrawal from a treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles was a “destructive” act that created a vacuum and stoked additional security risks. The 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty had kept nuclear missiles off European soil for more than three decades, but the treaty expired in 2019 after the US and Russia failed to agree on how to keep it alive. Speaking on the 35th anniversary of the signing of the treaty by the US president, Ronald Reagan, and Soviet general secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev, Zakharova said: The INF treaty had an indefinite life and was able to provide predictable restraint in the missile sphere for many years to come. Russia has claimed that its proposed safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was to “stop Ukrainian shelling”. A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, made the comments this morning, according to Reuters. Both sides have accused each other of shelling the plant, which is Europe’s biggest nuclear power station. There are fears the attacks could cause a nuclear accident. Russia seized it shortly after its invasion in February. The International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog has called for a demilitarised safety zone around the plant. The Red Cross has visited Ukrainian and Russian prisoners of war in the past week, and it hopes that inspections can become more frequent. Since the Russian invasion the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has seen hundreds of prisoners on both sides of the conflict. However its president, Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, said access had been “sporadic”. “My expectation is that these visits lead to more regular access to all prisoners of war,” the statement cited Spoljaric Egger as saying, according to Reuters. “While the recent visits are important progress, the ICRC must be granted unimpeded access to see all prisoners of war repeatedly and in private, wherever they are held.” The ICRC carried out a two-day visit to Ukrainian PoWs this week, according to Reuters. It also visited Russian PoWs last week. The UN human rights office said in November that its monitors had not been allowed access to Ukrainian prisoners held by Russia. Ukraine has introduced new emergency power cuts as it tried to repair energy infrastructure damaged in Russian airstrikes, which the national grid operator said had caused significant supply shortages. Russia targeted power facilities across Ukraine in the latest big wave of attacks on Monday, at a time of the year when energy consumption usually rises as temperatures plunge. “As of 11:00 on 8 December, because of damage caused by missile strikes to power plants and the high-voltage network, the system has a significant shortage of electricity,” the grid operator Ukrenergo said. It said the situation was complicated by the weather, with western regions facing frost, rain, snow and strong winds that were causing wires to ice over, Reuters reports, but the most difficult situation was in eastern areas, where fighting has been fiercest. “In all regions, there is a lack of energy – up to a third of what is needed,” said Oleksandr Starukh, the governor of the Zaporizhzhia region in south-eastern Ukraine. Monday’s attacks began as emergency blackouts were due to end, with previous damage repaired. DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private power producer, said there were now emergency power cuts in the capital Kyiv and the Kyiv region, in the southern region of Odesa and in Dnipro, central Ukraine. Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February, has increased attacks on energy facilities in recent weeks, saying strikes on vital infrastructure are militarily legitimate. Ukraine says attacks intended to cause civilian misery are a war crime. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has produced a paper after Vladimir Putin’s meeting with the Russian presidential council on Wednesday where he said the war in Ukraine could be a “lengthy process”. Putin struck an imperialist tone. He compared himself to Peter the Great by noting that Russia controls the Sea of Azov, which the Russian tsar also fought for. The ISW said Putin seemed unwilling to go for a temporary break in fighting to regroup, as the Nato secretary general had suggested the Kremlin may look to do. “The Russian military is continuing offensive operations around Bakhmut and is – so far -denying itself the operational pause that would be consistent with best military practice. “Putin’s current fixation with continuing offensive operations around Bakhmut and elsewhere is contributing to Ukraine’s ability to maintain the military initiative in other parts of the theater. Ukraine’s continued operational successes depend on Ukrainian forces’ ability to continue successive operations through the winter of 2022-2023 without interruption,” the paper said. The report’s authors added that there appeared to be friction in the Belarusian military over Russian attempts to pressure them into joining the war. “[The] ISW continues to assess that Belarus is highly unlikely to enter the war in Ukraine due to domestic factors that constrain Lukashenko’s willingness to do so.” Our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, is in Zaporizhzhia, from where he has filed this dispatch as fighting intensifies in southern Kherson. The people of Nova Kakhovka on the east bank of the Dnipro River had grown accustomed to constant shelling, but in recent days they have been hearing machine gun fire as the war draws closer to what could be its next major battlefield. Despite predictions that the conflict would slow down in the winter months, civilians arriving in Zaporizhzhia through the last open crossing point on the frontlines say the fighting is escalating in southern Kherson region as Ukrainian forces seek to keep the Russians on the retreat towards Crimea and beyond. “It has been machine guns lately, not artillery,” said Anna, a 78-year-old from Nova Khakovka after arriving at a police checkpoint in Zaporizhzhia. “The windows were shaking, the house was shaking. We were afraid that everything could collapse at any moment.” Read more: Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Moscow would keep to its moratorium on deploying intermediate-range nuclear forces in Europe, as long as the US did not deploy such weapons in Europe or Asia. “The moratorium is still in place, but if such weapons are deployed by the United States on European or Asian territory, our approach cannot remain unchanged,” Ryabkov told the Rossiya 24 news channel according to Reuters. He made similar comments a year ago. The UK Ministry of Defence has published its daily update on the situation in Ukraine according to its intelligence sources. It said Russia had an “almost continuous trench system” for a 60km (37 miles) stretch between Svatove in Luhansk oblast and the Russian border. The MoD added, however, that the depth of the defence remained “unclear”. Svatove is a small city to the north of Luhansk city. The region has been occupied since Russia’s initial invasion in 2014. The MoD said Russia’s 1st Guards Tank Army is partially deployed near Svatove but the “supposedly elite” group took heavy casualties earlier in the war, including in the retreat from Kharkiv in September 2022. “It has now been partially reinforced with mobilised reservists, although remaining well below its authorised strength of over 25,000 personnel,” the update added. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Europe lacked “critical defence capabilities” at the annual conference of the European Defence Agency on Thursday. Addressing attendees he said it made Europe vulnerable to “higher-level threats”. His comment echoes a recent remark by the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, who said “Europe isn’t strong enough” without the US. Here is the clip: As Christmas approaches, Ukrainian authorities are taking extra steps to try to create a festive feeling despite the conflict. In Kharkiv, which was occupied by Russian troops earlier this year, a tree has been erected in a subway to protect it from artillery or missiles. Russian forces are trying to use locals in Zaporizhzhia to fight for their army to replace Russian personnel who have been killed. The general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said in the Russian-occupied region, the authorities have issued summonses to men of conscription age in Melitopol. “The Russian occupiers plan to mobilise local residents in order to replenish current losses,” the update said. The Ukrainian army has killed another 340 Russian troops in the last 24 hours. More than 93,000 Russian personnel have been killed since 24 February, a post on Facebook by the general staff of the armed forces said. Battles on 8 December also led to the loss of two Russian battle tanks, two armoured combat vehicles and two artillery systems. A further two drones, which have been used to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure and residential areas, were shot down. These are figures provided by the Ukrainian side, which have not been verified by the Guardian. Russia’s published statistics show much lower numbers of losses. • The original key event headline on this blog entry has been corrected to make clear it was 93,000 Russian troops Ukraine is claiming have been killed. A Ukrainian pilot who shot down two missiles and five drones before ejecting from his plane has been awarded the Hero of Ukraine, the order of the Gold Star. Maj Vadym Voroshylov carried out the operation over the Vinnytsia oblast on 12 October, before ejecting from his jet after it had been damaged. A photo of him has been circulated on the internet in Ukraine this week, as he took a photo of himself bloodied but defiant afterwards, giving a thumbs-up to the camera. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy approved a government decree on Monday giving him the honour, in recognition of his service. Before I hand you over to my colleague, Harry Taylor, here are some of the latest snaps to come out of Ukraine today. The number of oil tankers waiting in the Black Sea to cross Istanbul’s Bosphorus strait on the way to the Mediterranean rose by five to 16 on Thursday, a shipping agency said, according to a Reuters report. Talks are continuing between western and Turkish officials on steps to resolve the tanker queues after new restrictions were rolled out aimed at Russian oil exports. The G7 group of countries, the European Union and Australia agreed to bar shipping service providers like insurers from helping export Russian oil unless it is sold at an enforced low price, or cap, to deprive Moscow of wartime revenue. But a separate Turkish measure in force since the start of the month has caused a logjam, requiring vessels to provide proof they have insurance covering the duration of their transit through the Bosphorus strait or when calling at Turkish ports. The Tribeca shipping agency named five new tankers longer than 200m waiting north of the Bosphorus strait to cross southbound towards the Mediterranean Sea, in addition to the 11 named a day earlier. It said no ships were scheduled to cross. At the Dardanelles strait further south, nine tankers were waiting to cross southbound, down from 12 a day earlier, the agency said. Three tankers were scheduled to pass through that strait on Thursday, two en route from Tuapse in Russia to Fujairah in the UAE and one en route from Tuzla in Turkey to Sidi Kerir in Egypt. Russian troops are reportedly taking part in tactical exercises in Belarus, according to the Russian defence ministry. Belarus has said it will not enter the war in Ukraine, but President Alexander Lukashenko has in the past ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near the Ukrainian border, citing threats from Kyiv and the west. In a statement cited by Reuters, Russia’s defence ministry said: Servicemen of the Western Military District ... continue intensive combat training on the ranges of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus … Combat training events are held during both daylight and at night. Servicemen are shooting from all types of small arms, as well as from mortars; they hone their skills in driving combat vehicles, pass psychological obstacle courses, study tactical medicine and other disciplines.” Video clips posted by the ministry showed Russian soldiers in snow gear training near tanks in a winter landscape, firing weapons including artillery. Ukraine used domestically-modified Soviet drones to strike Russian bases hundreds of miles from its border, according to a recent Politico report. The drones reportedly struck two military airbases in Russia killing three Russian service members and damaging two airplanes earlier this week. The drones used in the attack, according to two people familiar with the operation who spoke with Politico on the condition of anonymity, were modified Tu-141 surveillance aircraft left over from the Soviet era. “The key success factor was a surprise. Russia just did not expect anything of this sort,” said one of the individuals, who works with the Ukrainian government. “Now they will be prepared.” Ukraine has for months requested long-range missiles and drones from its western allies, but have so far been refused. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, which is still working despite taking major damage, Interfax Ukraine news agency cited a senior official as saying on Wednesday. Volodymyr Kudrytsky, chief executive of the Ukrenergo grid operator, also told a meeting arranged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) that his officials were scouring the world for the complex equipment needed for repairs. Eight recent waves of Russian air strikes on critical infrastructure have seriously damaged the grid and led to emergency and planned outages across the country. Interfax Ukraine cited Kudrytsky as saying: These attacks represent the biggest blow to a power grid that humanity has ever seen. More than 1,000 shells and rockets were fired at electrical facilities and lines, including substations.” Ukraine now has a serious shortage of generating capacity, even though consumption is down between 25% and 30% compared to the pre-war period. The system is still working, it is integrated, not broken or disconnected,” Kudrytsky said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy later said Ukraine was increasing the electricity supply every day but noted problems in Kyiv and several other regions. “We should not forget ... that it is impossible to restore 100% of the energy system, as it was before the beginning of the Russian energy terror,” he said in an evening video address. “Time is needed. That is why scheduled blackouts continue in most of the cities and districts,” he continued. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy provided a battleground update in his latest national address on Wednesday evening. Regarding the Donetsk region, Bakhmut districts and other hottest spots. A very fierce confrontation is ongoing there, every metre counts.” Zelenskiy also noted Russian forces made a “brutal, absolutely deliberate strike” on Kurakhove, also in the Donetsk region. The strike reportedly killed ten people. Today [Wednesday] the Russian army carried out a very brutal, absolutely deliberate strike at Kurakhove. Precisely at civilians. At ordinary people. At the market, elevator, gas station, bus station, residential building. The list of the dead so far includes ten people, there are many wounded.” The US has denounced “loose talk” on nuclear weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin mused on rising risks of nuclear war but said Moscow would not strike first. Putin hinted that “such a threat is rising” during a Kremlin meeting on Wednesday but assured that “Russia will under no circumstances use them first”. US State Department spokesman Ned Price, asked about Putin’s remarks, declined to reply directly but said: We think any loose talk of nuclear weapons is absolutely irresponsible.” Price said that nuclear powers around the world since the Cold War, including China, India, the United States and Russia itself, have been clear that “a nuclear war is something that must never be fought and can never be won.” We think any other rhetoric – whether it is nuclear saber-rattling or even raising the spectre of the use of tactical nuclear weapons – is something that is irresponsible,” Price said. It is dangerous, and it goes against the spirit of that statement that has been at the core of the nuclear non-proliferation regime since the Cold War.” US officials have voiced fear that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it feels routed on the battlefield and could plant a fictitious story to justify its actions. Putin dedicated some of his remarks on Wednesday to questions about the potential for nuclear war, which he said was growing more likely due to the conflict with the west. This threat is increasing, I can’t deny it,” Putin said in response to a question, adding that Russia would not use those weapons first. We have not gone crazy, we are aware of what nuclear weapons are. We have these means, and they are more advanced and more modern than those of any other nuclear country. As of today, this is an obvious fact. We are not going to wave these weapons around like a razor, running around the world, but of course we act with the understanding that they exist.” Vladimir Putin has admitted Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process” as he sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict, denied that Russian troops were deserting en masse from the field of battle, and claimed he would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. As for the slow process of the special military operation, then, of course, it can be a long-term process,” Putin said. But then you mentioned that new territories had appeared. This is such a significant result for Russia … The Azov Sea has become an internal Russian sea. Even Peter I had fought for access to the Azov Sea.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reported “very fierce” fighting in the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut where Russian troops continue to strike the eastern Donetsk region. The US on Wednesday denounced “loose talk” on nuclear weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin mused on rising risks of nuclear war but said Moscow would not strike first. For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: Russian shelling killed 10 people and wounded many others in the town of Kurakhove in eastern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko warned of an “apocalypse” scenario for the city this winter if Russian airstrikes on infrastructure continue. Russia has fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, Interfax Ukraine news agency said. President Vladimir Putin has said that Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process”. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack. Putin also claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict and denied that Russian troops were deserting en-mass from the field of battle. He claimed that the Russian military would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. The risk of nuclear weapons being used in the Ukraine conflict has lessened thanks to international pressure on Russia, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview published Thursday. “One thing has changed for the time being: Russia has stopped threatening to use nuclear weapons. In response to the international community marking a red line,” Scholz said in the interview with Germany’s Funke media group. Talks between Russia and the United States on securing an exchange of high-profile prisoners are making only sporadic progress, a top Russian diplomat said in comments published on Thursday. The two countries have been examining ways of conducting an exchange to enable jailed Americans Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan to go free. Moscow has made it known it would like convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout to be included in any deal. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to “freeze” the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter, adding that the conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. A road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has called on the country’s western allies to boycott Russian culture. Writing in the Guardian, Tkachenko argues that a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. The European Commission has proposed a ninth package of sanctions on Russia, including adding almost 200 additional individuals and entities on the sanctions list. In a statement, the head of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, accused Russia of “deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure” and of continuing to “bring deaths and devastation to Ukraine”. The US has made clear to Ukraine its “concerns” about any escalation of the war with Russia, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said. Kirby said the principle behind the war in Ukraine was one of sovereignty, and “unlike the Russians, we respect Ukrainian sovereignty”. Kirby’s comments came after Kyiv appeared to launch a pre-emptive strike on bombers on two Russian airbases far from the frontlines earlier this week. The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year. Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make. BP should donate its “wartime profits” in Russia to the reconstruction of Ukraine or ministers should impose a special windfall tax on the oil company to force it to do so, British MPs have told parliament. The British oil supermajor has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, one of the Kremlin’s most important oil assets and signalled its intent to exit Russia nine months ago, after Russia invaded Ukraine. At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report by the Office of the high commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said. An Orthodox priest accused of leaking information on Ukrainian defence positions to Russia has been sentenced to 12 years in prison, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office. The priest from Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, had been informing the Russians about the positions of Ukrainian troops since April, it said in a statement on Telegram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/18/un-chief-presidents-zelenskiy-erdogan-talks-ukraine-grain-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T19:07:20Z","webTitle":"Russia to stage ‘provocation’ at nuclear plant, warns Ukrainian military","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/un-chief-presidents-zelenskiy-erdogan-talks-ukraine-grain-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/18/un-chief-presidents-zelenskiy-erdogan-talks-ukraine-grain-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Russia to stage ‘provocation’ at nuclear plant, warns Ukrainian military","bodyText":"Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned that Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at a nuclear power plant they control, as the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment from the site. Guterres, on his second visit to Ukraine since the Russian invasion, joined the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for meetings and then a press conference in the western city of Lviv. “We are worried. We don’t want another Chernobyl,” Erdoğan said. It was the first visit to Ukraine by Turkey’s leader, who has been a key intermediary in negotiations with Russia. Zelenskiy said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It was taken over by Russian forces in March but is still being run by Ukrainians. The UN chief called on Russian forces to leave with their military equipment, amid fears that fighting around the site could lead to a deadly disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have traded accusations of shelling the site. “The facility must not be used as part of any military operation. Instead, agreement is urgently needed to re-establish Zaporizhzhia’s purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area,” Guterres said. Video footage shared online by a New York Times reporter showed at least five apparently military trucks parked inside the plant’s engine room near the turbo generator. In the hours before the international summit in western Ukraine, Russia announced it had deployed warplanes armed with hypersonic missiles to its Kaliningrad region, an enclave on the Baltic Sea that borders the EU and Nato members Poland and Lithuania. The commander of its Black Sea fleet has also been replaced, the Russian RIA news agency said, in one of the most high-profile military sackings since the invasion. It came after a series of humiliations for the fleet, including the sinking of its flagship Moskva cruiser and an attack on a key airbase in Crimea. Inside Ukraine, Russian forces stepped up attacks on Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city, ahead of the summit in Lviv. In attacks overnight and early on Thursday morning, at least 11 people were killed and more than 40 injured and a residential block was destroyed. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. Russian state media had already accused Ukraine of planning a “provocation” at the plant to coincide with the UN leader’s trip, raising fears that Russia’s military could be planning a “false-flag attack”. When Guterres travelled to Kyiv in April, Moscow carried out an airstrike on the city. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, said Ukraine must “prepare for all scenarios”, during a drill for emergency workers in Zaporizhzhia. On Wednesday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned Russia’s seizure of the plant had “raised the risk of a nuclear accident or incident” and accused Moscow of being “reckless” by using the area as a staging platform to launch artillery attacks on Ukrainian forces. Russia said it may shut down the plant, claiming backup support systems had been damaged in strikes. Igor Kirillov, the head of the radioactive, chemical and biological defence force, said if there was an accident at the site, radioactive material would cover Poland, Germany and Slovenia. Ukraine’s hydrometeorological institute also warned of contamination spreading across Europe, a BBC journalist reported. Two issues are causing deepening anxiety about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant. International nuclear safety officials have become concerned over the lack of spare parts, access for routine maintenance of the reactors, and contact with staff, all of which have been disrupted by the conflict. A second issue is shelling around the plant. According to Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear authority, the impacts from Grad missiles earlier this month were close to the spent fuel storage area, with the plant’s operator claiming Russian troops “aimed specifically” at the containers, despite the Russian military’s presence at the site. Russia accuses Ukraine of carrying out the shelling. On Friday, Guterres will travel to the Black Sea port of Odesa, a crucial gateway for Ukrainian grain to reach the rest of the world. He will then continue to Turkey to visit the Joint Coordination Centre, the body tasked with overseeing the accord. Ukraine’s fields feed hundreds of millions of people worldwide, so the abrupt halt to shipments has pushed up global grain prices at a time when famine is already threatening east Africa. The UN last month brokered an agreement to let shipments restart. So far, 24 ships have left Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, a monitoring group said. Kyiv has a backlog of 18m tonnes of grain from last year’s harvest, even as it starts bringing in the 2022 crop. It hopes to soon raise exports to 3m tonnes a month, easing world prices and clearing storage space for new grain. It will be six months on 24 August since the start of the invasion – which Russia calls a “special military operation” – and several UN security council members, including the US, Britain, the Republic of Ireland and Norway, have called for a meeting on that date. Kyiv is expected to launch a counteroffensive in southern Ukraine in the coming weeks and has carried out spectacular attacks deep inside Russian-held territory, including on an airbase in Crimea. But despite shipments of western weapons and ammunition, Ukraine is still struggling against heavy Russian artillery bombardment along the eastern front. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video on Wednesday that the war had reached a “strategic deadlock”. “Russian forces have achieved only minimal advances, and in some cases we have advanced, since last month,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2023/mar/13/i-hope-i-havent-killed-anybody-the-pacifist-author-fighting-on-ukraines-frontline","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-13T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"‘I hope I haven’t killed anybody’: the pacifist author fighting on Ukraine’s frontline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/mar/13/i-hope-i-havent-killed-anybody-the-pacifist-author-fighting-on-ukraines-frontline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2023/mar/13/i-hope-i-havent-killed-anybody-the-pacifist-author-fighting-on-ukraines-frontline","fields":{"headline":"‘I hope I haven’t killed anybody’: the pacifist author fighting on Ukraine’s frontline","bodyText":"Vlad Beliavsky hoped to bring some peace to the world with his first book, The Pyramid Mind. If we all trained our minds properly, he thought, we could live together in harmony. At best, he imagined his book might even stop wars. Today, he is in Kyiv, wearing military uniform and silhouetted against a neutral background. It is safer not to give details of where; he simply says he is in a military building. As his book is published, 13 years after it was conceived, Lieutenant Beliavsky is marking a year spent fighting for the future of Ukraine. He is a handsome, youthful 33-year-old. In other circumstances you could imagine him in a boyband or becoming the Brian Cox of psychology. But look closely, and there are heavy bags beneath his eyes. His skin is pallid. He talks slowly, measuring his words with scrupulous care. At times, he seems on the verge of tears. You look exhausted, I say. He smiles. “I’ve been in the army for a year, and we don’t have breaks or weekends. We just serve.” But he’s one of the lucky ones, he says. “I’m not on the frontline at the moment. I’m not deprived of sleep as I was in March and April last year.” Back then, he was defending a besieged Kyiv. “It was madness. We slept for only three hours a night.” He is now working in the cybersecurity team. What is life like? “Tough. But we are coping. It’s really hard here. I never thought a war of such intensity would take place again in Europe. It’s not a pleasant experience.” Beliavsky, I realise, is a master of understatement. Until he joined the army, he had always considered himself a pacifist. “I was more horrified at the thought of taking lives than being killed. Life is a gift, and we need to protect it. I always felt my mission was to help people develop this life, to grow, so we could be healthier, more productive, happier.” Not surprisingly, the start of the war caused an existential crisis. He wavered a few weeks before signing up. To go to war was a betrayal of his values. But not to go to war would have been a still bigger betrayal. “There was no other option. The smartest people in the world tried to negotiate with Russia and failed. I came to believe that in some cases you just need to stand up and fight back. Otherwise they would come and destroy everything. And I couldn’t let that happen. I thought if I stood aside, I’d never feel OK with myself in the future.” There is a quiet intensity to everything Beliavsky says. For all his conviction, he seems to be a man still coming to terms with a shattered belief system. Beliavsky grew up in Ukraine with a father who worked in commerce and a mother who worked in marketing. Fascinated by history, as a teenager he would sit with his father discussing the rise and fall of civilisations. Mad and bad dictators were a recurrent theme. At university in Kyiv, he studied international relations, and that’s where he came across Seneca’s writing on stoicism. “This book was written 2,000 years ago and it was speaking to me. That was the first time I understood the power of literature. There could be another guy in 100 years who reads your book and if it has value it could influence him. That’s great!” After an internship at the Ukrainian embassy in Kazakhstan, he worked for a year in international relations at the State Savings Bank of Ukraine. He hoped to become a diplomat. “I thought it was a means to reconcile people; to establish peace. Then I understood that peace comes from within.” He started to believe that conflict had to be treated at its source: by the time the stage of diplomacy is reached, it is often too late. He became more interested in psychology as a route to peace. “I thought, if we know how to reach internal harmony, we’ll know how to create harmony around ourselves. Because if I feel good about myself there is little chance I would start a war or suppress anybody.” In 2014, he began researching psychology and philosophy at Warwick University in the UK, studying for a PhD while continuing to work on his book. The more he studied, the more he realised he had work to do on himself. “I understood that I was messed up as well. I needed tools to fix myself.” In what way? “I didn’t know how to cope with negative emotions.” The Pyramid Mind is Beliavsky’s attempt to fix himself and the rest of us. He describes the book as a “mind management model” that explains how the mind is organised, how it works, and how best to nurture it. Part textbook, part self-help manual, it includes lots of practical advice. Rather than dedicating himself to one school of thought, Beliavsky is an integrative psychologist, uniting traditional medicine, psychology, alternative and complementary approaches. He is also a mixed martial arts expert. At the age of 19, he started learning aikido. “I asked our sensei why we were learning great techniques but ignoring others. Let’s diversify our skillset, I said, but those schools are very rigid.” So he started practising other martial arts away from the aikido class. “I felt as if I was cheating on my tutors and coaches! I ended up doing MMA because I favour this curiosity. You become a well-rounded fighter and it’s harder to defeat you.” Hold on, I say, I thought you were a pacifist? That’s the point, he says – MMA helped him move beyond negative thoughts and made him less likely to have real fights. “Even though I practised martial arts, I never tried to prove dominance over people. If somebody tries to hurt me, I do anything to avoid verbal or physical conflict.” It is a philosophy he took to the frontline. Beliavsky returned to Kyiv from the UK during the pandemic. As an IT expert, he developed apps to improve mental health, while working on his book. When the writing was finished, he planned to go on a long surfing trip in Asia, but by then Russia had invaded Ukraine. Last March he joined the army as a lieutenant. How would he describe a typical day on the frontline? “You sleep little. Too little. Then you go to your checkpoint with your military unit and patrol your district. You communicate with other units and try to capture saboteurs and maintain order in the streets. If there is a suspicious group of people, you need to be ready to use rifles and start fighting. It was like an apocalypse movie because the streets were deserted.” What was it like for a pacifist to use a rifle? There is a long pause. “Well, luckily I didn’t have to use it very often, but still … I was asked this question almost a year ago by a friend who is an American sniper. I said I hoped I would wound a person but not kill them, so that we could interrogate them. So you’re determined to do your job, but to say you’re absolutely determined to take someone’s life … no.” He trails off. What did his sniper friend say? “He said he remembered almost everyone he killed. When I asked how he coped, he said he didn’t perceive those people as human beings and it helped him. It was a hard thing for me to accept.” Could he ever adopt that mentality? “No,” he says quietly. Did he manage to shoot people without killing them? “I hope I didn’t kill anybody.” He says he can’t be sure. “Things happened so fast that you just don’t see everything.” Has his psychology proved useful in a war setting? “Yes, it’s absolutely practical,” he says. Beliavsky spends his spare time supporting his comrades. “I tell people that I know psychotherapy and psychology, I’m here if you want to talk and I have a programme for you. I have little success with the older generation, but young soldiers come for advice.” Beliavsky says his sniper friend knew more about psychology than most. “He suffered from PTSD from the war in Afghanistan and he uses mindfulness techniques to stop flashbacks. He understood the nightmare of having trauma because of war and asked me what he could do to feel better.” Are many people in Ukraine traumatised? “Yep. Many.” Beliavsky stresses he’s not just talking about the military. Is he traumatised? “I hope not,” he eventually answers. “I sleep relatively well. I had a couple of nightmares during the first month. When a shopping mall in Kyiv was destroyed by a ballistic missile, we were nearby. It was a very frightening experience.” Has he lost friends? “Yes. I lost friends on the battlefield. Not many, but some of them I knew well. I lost three friends who I knew before the war. We talked together, went to pubs, and worked together for the same IT company. We enlisted at the same time. Luckily, I haven’t lost relatives.” Beliavsky says his psychology has helped him and others cope with fear. “Soldiers have a stereotype that if I feel fear, I’m weak. And I say, well, that’s bullshit. We all have emotions, including negative emotions, for a reason. We react fast when we face a life-threatening situation. We run faster, we become stronger, we feel fear but that’s OK. It helps us to fight the situation or to flee. Fear only becomes a problem when it paralyses you.” When was he most frightened? “On 4 March, the day I joined the army. I woke up at 4am and heard that there were battles at the nuclear power station in the south of Ukraine. Fire broke out and Russians were shelling the nuclear power plant. It was the most horrifying thing I’ve felt in my life, because if there was an explosion, it wasn’t just about Ukraine – the whole continent would be impacted. It’s the largest nuclear facility in Europe. If there was an explosion, there would be no life. There would be no place for peace, for raising children, for becoming better versions of ourselves.” He seems to be reliving the horror in front of me, and is momentarily overcome by hopelessness. “At times, I just don’t see a solution.” Then he snaps out of it. “I feel lucky I can help people with the skills I have, that I can teach them psychology and instil belief.” Beliavsky knows he can’t afford to despair. He spends a lot of time teaching fellow soldiers how to rewrite the stories they tell themselves. Understandably, many can only see negative endings. “One of our most negative stories is that we’re trapped, we’re losing our lives, so it’s a nasty time to live. I’m helping them to make tweaks to these stories so they can reshape the plot.” In The Pyramid Mind, Beliavsky says that the most contented people are realists rather than optimists or pessimists. So how does he tweak narratives to make them positive but realistic? “A friend of mine said he was afraid there would be no future in our country, even after the war ended. I said: ‘What is one good or constructive thing that has come out of the war?’ And he thought, and said: ‘Well, we have become stronger as a nation, we have a powerful army, and we have people we are proud of.’ I asked him: ‘Do you think if we manage to get through this nightmare period, this hell, these people would help you and our country to rebuild faster and would there be a brighter future for everybody?’ And he said: ‘Yes.’ So he created a new narrative.” As for Beliavsky’s future, he’s telling himself as many positive stories as possible. He hopes to find a partner, have children, work on a second book, create apps to help people with their mental health. Even now, he is working on apps to support people through the war. What has the war taught him about the mentality of Ukrainians? “I knew we were resilient, but I didn’t know how wonderful and strong our people are. You’ve got 40 million united Ukrainians, so what will Putin do? Will he massacre 40 million people? That’s the only way he can win this war. The only way.” One of his biggest concerns is that war robs his people of their humanity. “I see people changing because of the war. I see them becoming tougher, and I feel heartbroken because Ukrainians are extremely outgoing, friendly people. We need to protect our souls and minds.” Are Ukrainians becoming less kind? “It’s not that you become less kind, you just smile less often, joke less often. You see death every day and, as Nietzsche said, if you look at the darkness too long, the darkness also starts looking at you.” Does he think about the possibility of being killed? He nods. “I don’t find it very scary, to tell the truth. I mentioned stoicism, and one of the values I remind myself of almost every day is memento mori – we all die. The most important thing for me is the quality, not the length of life.” He talks to friends about the worst thing that can happen, and death is not top of the list. “You don’t want to be killed, but there are more terrifying things, like losing family and becoming disabled because of the attack. Many of my friends tell me that they hope it will be fast if it has to happen.” Actually, he says, if he were to die in the war, he would now feel he has made his mark on the world. “I wanted to create a book and it was the work of my life, and I was extremely happy that I finished it. When I joined the military, I thought: if I get killed, there is at least something that will keep living.” Has the war made him a better psychologist? Another pause. “I don’t know. Right now I am helping many more people than before the war. So I have much more practical experience.” Would he prefer to be a less good psychologist in a time of peace? “Yes,” he says, with a heartbreaking smile. • The Pyramid Mind by Vlad Beliavsky is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (£9.99).

Alexander Rodnyansky, an adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the war-torn country needed to speed up efforts to reform industries as it looked to rebuild after Russia’s invasion. Rodnyansky told the Guardian that the Ukrainian government needed to “create the foundations for rapid economic growth” while also financing the conflict. Ukraine faces a debt crisis as well as inflation of more than 20% as the country counts the cost of Russia’s offensive. Rodnyansky, who is also a professor of economics at the University of Cambridge, said “receiving more foreign aid is the easiest way to fund the war”; however, efforts were being made to cut spending, collect taxes and issue debt to finance its efforts. He said that Zelenskiy and his top team were also examining priorities to rebuild the economy, including progressing efforts initiated before the war to rework 50-year-old labour regulations. “We have deep issues with our labour code, developed in the 1970s, that needs to be overhauled. “We’re going to try to emulate a more liberal approach, like Denmark, with a flexible labour market because we need to catch up.” Rodnyansky said there were “peculiarities with our post-Soviet system” that had fuelled red tape. “If you want to let someone off on holiday, there is four pages of bureaucracy you need to go through. “There are also more conventional things to reform: ease of hiring, ease of firing, severance pay, flexible hours and contracts and fixed-term contracts.” Labour organisations have expressed concerns over workers’ rights amid the Ukrainian government’s labour liberalisation, which has included a vote in favour of legalising zero-hours contracts earlier this year. Rodnyansky said he was also in favour of reviewing minimum wages to scrap them in some industries where it did not increase employment. “We need to make sure it’s not too high because our economy is collapsing and we need to make sure it does not push up unemployment,” he said. A group of leading economists said last month that Ukraine’s government needed to overhaul its tax and spending policies or risk an economic crisis that could “cripple its ability to sustain the war effort”. Rodnyansky called on western nations to expand the sanctions imposed on Russian companies and individuals and sell their assets to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine. “The UK has done a lot but it has not been exhaustive,” he said. The government of Ukraine, the European Commission and the World Bank have estimated that the cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine is almost $350bn (£310bn) and rising. Rodnyansky was promoted to become chief economic adviser earlier this year after two years with the government. His father is a film producer who helped Zelenskiy become a household name as an actor. Russian attacks on Ukrainian power stations, including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear site in south-eastern Ukraine, have led to safety worries about nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jan/19/rip-levelling-up-boris-johnson-catchphrase-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T18:13:32Z","webTitle":"RIP ‘levelling up’ – another Johnson catchphrase that failed to deliver | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/19/rip-levelling-up-boris-johnson-catchphrase-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/19/rip-levelling-up-boris-johnson-catchphrase-policy","fields":{"headline":"RIP ‘levelling up’ – another Johnson catchphrase that failed to deliver","bodyText":"Levelling up is cancelled. It is so yesterday, past its sell-by date, rather Boris Johnson, defunct. Tory MPs have been given orders to drop it as a mere soundbite since “nobody knows what it means”. Instead they should use “community enhancing” and something called “gauging up”. There is no limit to the linguistic banality of modern British government. The proof is in this week’s presumably final bonanza of levelling up gifts from Rishi Sunak, announced in Blackpool. Out of his sack pops a new seafront for Cleethorpes, a high street for Catterick, an “obesity project” for Farnborough, an “AI campus” for Blackpool (no kidding), a Brexit relief road for Dover, a health centre for Camden, “step-free access” for Colindale tube station, buses for Teesside, a ferry for Shetland – on its goes, like a Lego catalogue. In any other country these would be routine spending projects decided quietly by local politicians and officials. They would be funded by local taxes and borrowing, or met within a central block grant. Only in Britain do such petty projects have to be taken to London and their proponents queue up, cap in hand, waiting on the generosity and whim of some gracious ruler. The operation is not so much Santa Claus as Louis XIV. The total sum allocated from this year’s so-called “shared prosperity” bounty is £2.1bn, supposedly to “rebalance” the British economy in the north and south. In reality, it does no such thing, since, we are told, grants must be bid for and judged “on their merits”. Only one bid in five is successful, even though a principal purpose of the programme is supposedly to atone for the cut of more than 20% in local government spending during a decade of austerity. The true gulf between local and national investment in infrastructure in Britain is obscene. Levelling up’s £2.1bn for 2023 compares with about £5bn a year spent by the Treasury on just one Johnson vanity project, the £100bn HS2 railway. How can Sunak possibly tell nurses and teachers he is short of money? HS2’s sole merit is to offer more capacity for home counties commuters into London’s Euston station. Yet the desperately needed east-west railway between Leeds and Manchester has been cancelled. Meanwhile Manchester can eat its heart out while London celebrates the opening of Europe’s most splendid new underground, the £19bn Elizabeth line. As if to ram home his exasperation with levelling up, Sunak has cancelled its cruellest gesture, the summary death sentence passed in November on the English National Opera. To prove levelling up meant business, this had been sacrificed by the Arts Council for not being as posh as the Royal Opera. It was fobbed off with a suggestion that it move to Manchester, like a disgraced priest exiled to a heathen outpost of empire. Now the ENO may yet stay in London. All that said, levelling up should not be dismissed out of hand. Johnson may have been chiefly concerned to favour his former Labour, “red wall” seats in the north. But there is no argument that Britain’s north-south divide is appalling, one of the widest gulfs between rich and poor areas of any of the world’s developed economies. It is ironic that areas that were most pro-Brexit are its chief victims. As so often with Johnson, catchphrases could not convert into policy. Ten years of austerity have left all councils in Britain struggling to meet their statutory obligations to policing, social work and community care. There is virtually no money for discretionary local projects. This has led to the growth of the present ad hoc handouts, pioneered more than 30 years ago by Lord Heseltine, when he was environment secretary under John Major. They were awarded on a competitive basis, with London and the south-east tending to win by virtue of their expanding populations and more enterprising councils. The result is the present parody of Christmas. The big money pours into favoured ministerial projects – motorways, airports, nuclear power stations, universities and hospitals – but local ones depend on Whitehall charity. There would be dribs and drabs for a bus service, a startup business, some brownfield housing or a civic museum. Any marginal seat MP had only to ask. Freeports were invented by Thatcher but discontinued in 2012 as pointless. Now they are strangely being revived. The geographical imbalance in Britain’s economy may well lie at the root of the much-debated decline in its prosperity. It will not be corrected by headline-grabbing ministerial gestures. As was indicated by levelling up’s forerunner, Cameron/Osborne’s “northern powerhouse”, rebalancing will require massive attention to reducing the magnetic appeal of London and the south-east, notably to creative young people. What is clear is that this must start with leadership, with decisions and resources devolved to local electors and their councils, as happens in the booming cities of Germany, France and Scandinavia. It is laughable that a London official should decide if Cleethorpes needs a new seafront or Shetland a new ferry. Access to central and local tax revenues and discretion over their use must be restored to elected councils. Keir Starmer has got the point. He has pledged to “take back control” for local democracy. But every party leader says that in opposition. None has ever done it. What exactly does Starmer mean by control? Or will he too degenerate into government by handout?

Unite said it had informed the owner of the Stanlow refinery, India’s Essar Group, that its members would “under no circumstances unload any Russian oil regardless of the nationality of the vessel which delivers it”. A ban on Russian vessels introduced by transport secretary, Grant Shapps, this week does not cover cargo. This has allowed several ships to dock despite carrying gas or oil that was ultimately purchased from Kremlin-controlled entities. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said: “Essar may believe that it is justifiable to transport Russian oil under a flag of convenience but Unite does not. Unite urges the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, to close this loophole immediately.” The Stanlow refinery, near Liverpool, is a key source of oil in the north-west of England, and is supported by a key trading relationship with Litasco, a fuel trading firm owned by Russia’s second largest oil company, Lukoil. The action at Stanlow came as gas prices hit record highs and dockworkers in Rotterdam said they would also refuse to unload oil and gas tainted by “blood”, hiring lawyers to back their campaign. Russia typically supplies 30-40% of Europe’s gas, mostly via pipelines, but liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments are another significant source. Ten oil tankers are en route to Rotterdam from Russia, with about 40 more Russian ships due to dock at Europe’s biggest port in the coming month, shipping data shows. Dutch dockers said on Friday they would not offload the cargoes and were preparing for a legal backlash from oil companies and shippers. “There is blood on this oil, blood on this coal and blood on the gas,” said Niek Stam, a spokesperson for FNV Havens, the largest Dutch dockworkers’ union. “We are in the process of finding out how we can boycott it without risking an enormous fine in court,” he told the investigative journalism unit Source Material. The Dutch government has taken no action against Russian ships. Stam said he feared being sued by Russian businesspeople or Dutch oil companies who would “bankrupt his union”, if he encouraged dockers to reject Russian cargoes before his government takes action. FNV Havens has consulted lawyers in readiness for that eventuality. The Netherlands receives more ships from Russia each year than any other European country, most of them docking in Rotterdam. If European countries did not act together to block Russian vessels the ships would simply divert to neighbouring countries, Stam said. In the UK, some consignments of Russian oil and gas have still been able to arrive, notably at Foyle Port in Northern Ireland and Tranmere on Merseyside. Dockers at the Isle of Grain terminal in the Thames Estuary refused to handle a consignment of liquefied natural gas bound for Centrica, the owner of British Gas, forcing the tanker carrying LNG to divert. One gas analyst said that dockworkers who do not want to handle Russian gas and oil may find it hard to identify cargoes because it can be switched between ships. He pointed to one Russian-managed tanker that arrived in France and would have been barred from the UK under Shapps’ ban. Instead, it pumped its cargo on to another boat that then sailed to Isle of Grain. On Friday, another vessel called the Pluto was still moored at Foyle Port, where one source said port staff were “sickened” after they were informed by the Department for Transport that there was no legal basis for refusing entry. The Seacod, a German-owned tanker carrying Russian oil, was moored in the Mersey on Friday, clearly visible from riverside walkways near the centre of Liverpool. An Essar spokesperson said the company was “deeply concerned by the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Ukraine” and that it was “fully complying with the statutory framework implemented by the UK government with regard to Russia-related entities”. They added: “Earlier this week, we turned away two cargos of non-Russian origin crude oil which would have been delivered in Russian-flagged tankers. “We can confirm that a German-flagged vessel was approved to berth at Tranmere oil terminal by the port authority on Thursday 3 March. This vessel set sail for Tranmere on 22 February, before the invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent introduction of UK government sanctions. “For a number of days, we have been working urgently to find alternative sources of diesel while simultaneously ensuring uninterrupted supply of fuel to the north-west of England. “Essar will continue to comply fully and will respond promptly to any changes the UK government may make to the statutory framework of sanctions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/10/ukraine-russia-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-199-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-10T00:15:54Z","webTitle":"Ukraine-Russia war latest: what we know on day 199 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/10/ukraine-russia-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-199-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/10/ukraine-russia-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-199-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine-Russia war latest: what we know on day 199 of the invasion","bodyText":"Russia said on Friday it was dispatching reinforcements to the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine, where Kyiv’s forces have announced robust gains as part of a broader counter-offensive. Russian state media broadcast footage of columns of Russian tanks, support vehicles and artillery travelling along paved roads and dirt tracks. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his forces had liberated more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region and that fighting continued in the eastern Donbas and the south. The European Commission has urged EU states to reassess the terms on which they grant visas to Russian travellers and to root out applicants that pose a security threat. “We should not be naive, Putin’s aim is to destroy the EU and he would like to attack us where we are weakest,” the EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, said on Friday. The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Friday that it had pushed back against Russian attacks near 10 settlements, the Kyiv Independent reported. The staff said Russian forces had launched more than 12 missiles and more than 12 airstrikes on Ukrainian territory in the past 24 hours. Shelling has destroyed power infrastructure at Enerhodar, the Ukrainian city where staff operating the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant live. The shelling possed a growing threat to the plant, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Friday. The UN nuclear watchdog said conditions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant were increasingly precarious and that a safety zone around it needed to be immediately established to prevent a nuclear accident. The International Atomic Energy Agency director, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said on Friday that there was minimal chance of re-establishing reliable offsite power lines to the plant and that its Ukrainian operator was considering shutting down the only remaining operating reactor. EU finance ministers supported a €5bn ($5bn) loan for Ukraine to help maintain the country’s schools, hospitals and other needed operations amid Russia’s invasion. The loan, agreed on Friday, will be backed by guarantees of EU member states and is part of an overall €9bn package announced in May. The EU executive have pledged to devise unprecedented measures in the coming days to address an energy price shock as a result of Russia’s war on Ukraine, including a controversial gas price cap that could further anger the Kremlin. European energy ministers tasked the European Commission with working through this weekend to draw up legal texts that will include emergency funding for consumers struggling to afford soaring bills. A Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region announced on Friday that civilians were being evacuated from three of the region’s Russian-controlled territories that have come under threat from the Ukrainian counter-offensive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/05/how-are-western-firms-with-russian-interests-reacting-to-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-05T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"How are western firms with Russian interests reacting to sanctions?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/how-are-western-firms-with-russian-interests-reacting-to-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/05/how-are-western-firms-with-russian-interests-reacting-to-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"How are western firms with Russian interests reacting to sanctions?","bodyText":"The Russian Wealth Advisors Forum describes itself as “the leading meeting place” for global experts who advise ultra-high net worth individuals from Russia and the post-Soviet states. The agenda for this year’s gathering in Zürich, due to be held in May, was laser-focused on defending the wealth of the Russian super-rich. “The world has become a perilous place for the wealthy,” the event’s website fretted. “Governments are hungry for cash. Information on who owns what is flowing around. The rich are in the spotlight, and often a target.” Presentations, including “The Pandora papers and their effect on the wealthy”, “Tax and immigration”, and whether cryptocurrency was a bankable asset, would be delivered by speakers from top accounting and legal firms, including PwC, EY and Mishcon de Reya. But as of Thursday morning, the Russian Wealth Advisors Forum was no more. “We are currently in the process of exit from the Russian market, passing all Russian events to a new owner,” the event’s organiser said by email. Exactly who will be willing to take on such an event now is unclear. Rather than strategising fresh deals and investments, Russia’s billionaires and millionaires are instead frantically relocating their liquid assets out of democratic states, fleeing a tsunami of sanctions from the US, the EU, and to a lesser extent the UK, aimed at pressuring the Putin regime into a ceasefire. On Wednesday the Biden administration announced the formation of Task Force KleptoCapture to identify and freeze the assets of Russian business people who prospered under the Putin regime. “Oligarchs be warned: we will use every tool to freeze and seize your criminal proceeds,” said Lisa Monaco, the deputy attorney general. At the same time, western businesses are scrambling to reduce their exposure to the Russian market with the hope of mitigating the blowback from current or further sanctions. In the UK, that has created a host of problems for the consultants, accountants, PR firms and lawyers who represent London’s professional services sector. The lawyers London’s defamation lawyers have developed a chequered reputation at home and internationally for threatening journalists with UK court action on behalf of wealthy clients. That distaste has traditionally been countered with the argument that every client is entitled to representation. But after the invasion, at least one libel firm has said it was not accepting Putinist clients. In a statement published on its website, Carter-Ruck said it was “not working for any Russian individuals, companies or entities seeking to challenge, overturn, frustrate or minimise sanctions”, and that it never had. “Carter-Ruck is not acting for, and will not be acting for, any individual, company or entity associated with the Putin regime,” it said. “We are not acting for any sanctioned individuals or entities, whether to have sanctions lifted or otherwise,” said a spokesperson for Schillings. “We hope that the government’s sanctions will be an effective tool in foreshortening the Russian regime’s abhorrent war in Ukraine.” Another libel firm, Harbottle and Lewis, said: “We are not acting for any sanctioned individuals or entities, and we are not engaging and nor have we engaged with the government in relation to the imposition of any sanctions.” One of the partners at a third firm, Mishcon de Reya, was among those who had been scheduled to speak at the Russian Advisors Wealth Forum before it was pulled. A spokesperson for the firm said he would have withdrawn had the event not been cancelled first. The spin doctors The public relations industry also faces a reckoning, with UK government sources briefing that those who continue to represent allies and agents of the Putin regime could expect to pay a price. In addition to dumping sanctioned clients, “we are also in the process of reviewing all ongoing connections with non-sanctioned Russian entities and, where it is appropriate to withdraw from those matters, we will do so,” said a spokesperson for FTI Consulting. “We will not be taking on any new Russia-controlled clients at this time.” Asked if it was still representing Oleg Deripaska’s aluminium firm EN+, Billy Clegg, a partner at the PR firm Camarco replied: “We resigned yesterday.” Andrew Hayes, the managing partner of the PR firm Hudson Sandler, said: “In light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which we utterly condemn, we are stopping all our Russia business.” Francis Ingham, head of the Public Relations and Communications Association, told Politico that Russia was now “a pariah state”. He continued: “Our members cannot, under any circumstances, support organisations that are on the sanctions list.” The accountants Accountancy firms, including the so-called “big four” – PwC, EY, Deloitte and KPMG – have issued statements expressing shock at the Russian invasion. Together they employ more than 13,000 people in the country, and audit the accounts and balance sheets of private and state-owned entities. Firms do not routinely publish their profits at a country level, although an EY transparency document from 2019 reported revenues of more than 6bn roubles (£41m). A PwC spokesperson said it deplored “the violation of international law and the Russian aggression against Ukraine”, while EY said it was “evaluating existing and new mandates in light of new sanctions and a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape”. A spokesperson for Deloitte said: “Russia’s invasion of this sovereign nation is an indefensible act of aggression that echoes the darkest days in European history.” “It has been devastating to watch the tragic events in Ukraine unfold and my thoughts are with all of those affected,” said Jonathan Holt, the chief executive of KPMG UK in a statement condemning the invasion on LinkedIn. Amid the expressions of dismay, substantive commitments to shutter Russian offices or cease working with state-owned Russian entities have been noticeably lacking. However speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior executive at one of the big four said the firms were necessarily issuing “tortured” statements in order to avoid inciting reprisals against local employees by the Putin regime. The executive explained that accounting firms were federations of companies associated with a brand, rather than hierarchical structures whereby a Russian subsidiary was “owned” by a western headquarters. As a result accountancy firms global headquarters’ cannot easily instruct their Russian offices to drop certain business, and many, if not most, of their local partners are themselves Russian. As well as opening the firms up to legal claims for breach of contract, they said, this would risk inciting retaliation against local staff by the Kremlin, which has signalled plans to ban western firms from dumping their clients. But they said it was likely that within a matter of months the various firms’ Russian arms would disaffiliate from the western brands. “Directionally are people going to have to leave their networks? Probably yes,” they said. “But it has to be done in such a way as to not antagonise the Russian authorities.” The same executive said the massive array of sanctions levelled against Putinist Russiaafter its invasion of Ukraine had created a legal minefield for western, and particularly American, firms retaining their Russian businesses or subsidiaries. Multinationals from McDonald’s to Microsoft field Russian subsidiaries, which still need to be reflected on their parent company’s balance sheet, the executive said. There is a legal requirement for all subsidiaries to be audited in order to guarantee the financial integrity of their parent companies. However, the executive said, it is now unclear whether such accounts can legally be audited by a western firm. Similarly, if Russia proceeds with laws banning western companies from leaving, accountancy firms could be committing criminal or civil offences in Russia if they simply abandon the business. That leaves accountancy firms stuck between a rock and a hard place, needing to balance their compliance with western sanctions against the risk of reprisal from the Kremlin. Nonetheless, they said, the direction of travel was clear and it was inevitable that significant drawdown would take place over the coming months. “There is an enormous amount of work going on behind the scenes,” the executive said. “The current status quo is not an option.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/jan/04/the-age-of-interconnection-by-jonathan-sperber-review-a-breathless-race-through-recent-history","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-04T09:00:13Z","webTitle":"The Age of Interconnection by Jonathan Sperber review – a breathless race through recent history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/04/the-age-of-interconnection-by-jonathan-sperber-review-a-breathless-race-through-recent-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/jan/04/the-age-of-interconnection-by-jonathan-sperber-review-a-breathless-race-through-recent-history","fields":{"headline":"The Age of Interconnection by Jonathan Sperber review – a breathless race through recent history","bodyText":"It takes chutzpah to write a synoptic history of the world in the second half of the 20th century, a period within living memory of the reading public. But it is a history Jonathan Sperber handles with brio, summoning evidence from personal anecdotes and high theory, vignettes and statistics. In its range of themes and reconstructions, The Age of Interconnection invites favourable comparison with that other survey of the 20th century, Eric Hobsbawm’s The Age of Extremes. Yet it is quite unlike it. Where the Marxist historian offered a sweeping narrative arc illustrating the relentless advance of capitalism, Sperber dispenses with a unifying theme altogether. It’s a sign of the times: we’ve lost faith in grand narratives, more’s the pity. His framing sheds little light on his period. As every historian knows, all ages are ages of interconnection. But what he loses in explanatory depth, he gains in intellectual breadth. Reading the book is a bit like watching a pentathlon. In lieu of fencing, riding, swimming, shooting and running, we have sections on the environment, economy, politics, society and cultural and intellectual life. It appears Sperber has taken Proust’s dictum to heart: “to write on everything to the point of exhaustion”. The exhaustiveness verges on redundancy at times, as in his tortuous excursions on staphylococcus and streptococcus infections, and rocket velocity. Class in the 20th century “took the form of a hierarchy”, he explains, as if to a Martian. But even if he doesn’t spell it out, there is a story being told. He divides his Age into three sub-periods: the Postwar Era (roughly, the baby boomer generation), the Age of Upheaval (the children of Marx and Coca-Cola), and the Late Millennium Era (the heirs of the end of history). A simpler schema would have been just as serviceable: the first half was the age of ambition; the second, one of apathy. Nothing screamed mid-century ambition like five-year plans. There’s something touching about the confidence of the Soviets’ state planning committee, whose annual inventories of necessary commodities ran to 70 volumes and 12,000 pages. Not so China’s Second Five-Year Plan, the famous Great Leap Forward, which redirected farm labour to backyard furnaces to augment steel output, destroying crop yields and also some 30 million lives in the process. But it was colossal state power, Sperber reminds us, that made modern public heath possible. Mass production of penicillin helped secure allied victory in the second world war. It took scarcely a decade to eradicate smallpox by 1977. The insecticide DDT came close to dispatching the gypsy moth and fire ant in the US two decades earlier. Asahi Gurafu, Japan’s answer to Life magazine, informed readers in the 50s that nuclear power would prevent sashimi from spoiling. The director of the Kurchatov Institute, the nerve centre of the Soviet atomic programme, thought it could be harnessed to transform Siberia into a subtropical paradise. Nature had its revenge, of course. The decimation of insects’ avian predators called into question the wisdom of spraying the midwest with DDT. Drug-resistant superbugs emerged. TB and malaria returned. Aids appeared on the scene. The blase response did little to help. “Aids is primarily a disease of homosexuals and there is no homosexual in Botswana,” an official declared. One of the statements must have been wrong, because by 2000, one in four adults there was HIV positive. Five years after the release of David Bowie’s Life on Mars?, a 1976 Viking expedition to the planet answered his question. Nuclear missiles remained in their silos, but cigarettes accounted for the death of one in five men in the second half of the century. The oil shock revealed the dark sides of both communism and capitalism. Struggling to pay off dollar-denominated debts, the GDR had a Stasi agent sell art and literary manuscripts to western collectors for hard currency. Romania went further, “selling” Jews to western governments for $25,000 per person. Labour, king in the middle of the century – saving Juan Perón, then Argentina’s vice president, from a military coup in 1945; overthrowing Edward Heath in 1974 – lost to capital, which regained the upper hand after a string of strikes were put down in the early 80s, from Girangaon to Orgreave. Sperber offers a sobering balance sheet of “heavily regulated capitalism”, which delivered phenomenal growth but also produced trade imbalances and global hierarchies. He doesn’t say as much, but I get the impression that he thinks this is the worst way of organising societies except for all the others. It’s a worldview that puts him in the company of sociologist Raisa Gorbacheva, who road-tripped around Rome in 1971 fleetingly with her husband, to whom she said, I imagine over pasta alla carbonara and frascati: “Misha, why do we live worse than they do?” • Pratinav Anil is a lecturer in history at St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford and author of Another India (Hurst).

Russia initially said it would abandon the brokered deal that allowed grain exports from Ukraine through the Black Sea, following a drone attack on its warships in the port of Sevastopol. Russia’s defence ministry said it was satisfied it had received “sufficient” guarantees from Kyiv that it would not use the maritime corridor to carry out attacks. Zelenskiy said the reversal showed “Russian blackmail has led nowhere”. After eight months of war “the Kremlin is saying that they demanded security guarantees from Ukraine”, he said. “Two hundred and fifty two days ago Russia demanded security guarantees from the United States of America. “These are really striking changes. This shows both the failure of Russian aggression and how strong you and I are when we remain united.” Russia’s threatened withdrawal had reignited fears over global hunger and high food prices that had been alleviated by the grain scheme earlier this year, which allowed cargo ships to move Ukrainian gain without fear of being targeted. Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of using the grain corridor to prepare attacks on Russia, including the bombing of the Kerch Bridge in Crimea last month, where the explosives used in the attack were allegedly shipped from Odesa. The US welcomed the restoration of the deal and urged Russia to renew it later this month. The deal is set to expire on 19 November. Russia’s decision to rejoin the UN grain corridor has been seen by Ukraine and its western allies as a humiliating U-turn. “Putin was once again humiliated … the Kremlin blackmailer once again made himself a laughing stock before the whole world and retreated,” Anton Gerashchenko, a senior presidential adviser to Zelenskiy, wrote over Telegram on Wednesday night. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will be seen as having successfully called the Russian bluff to blockade Ukrainian ports or even sink civilian cargo ships carrying grain abroad. The Turkish leader had said exports of grain from Ukraine would continue with or without Russian approval and appears to have brokered the Russian climbdown. Russian attacks were reported across large areas of Ukraine on Thursday, with heavy shelling in numerous regions damaging infrastructure, including electricity supplies to Europe’s largest nuclear plant, Ukrainian officials said. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has again been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, Ukraine nuclear firm Energoatom said. The plant, in Russian hands but operated by Ukrainian workers, has 15 days’ worth of fuel to run the generators, Energoatom said. Russian strikes were also reported in Kryvyi Rih, in central Ukraine, and in Sumy and Kharkiv, in the north-east. Heavy fighting was ongoing in the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. “The enemy is trying to keep the temporarily captured territories, concentrating its efforts on restraining the actions of the Defence Forces in certain areas,” Ukraine’s general staff said on Thursday. Russia has said it targeted infrastructure as part of what it calls its “special military operation” to degrade the Ukrainian military and remove what it says is a potential threat against Russia’s security. As a result, Ukrainian civilians have endured power cuts and reduced water supplies in recent weeks. Russia denies targeting civilians, though the conflict has killed thousands, displaced millions and left some Ukrainian cities in ruins. Foreign ministers from the G7 group of rich democracies will discuss how best to coordinate further support for Ukraine when they meet on Thursday in Germany following recent Russian attacks on energy infrastructure.

It was, as one resident, Galina Padalko, put it, “a beautiful place”. There were parks, a new German architect-designed zoo, thriving cafes and restaurants, and a monumental central square, once adorned with a statue of Lenin. The city had several universities, international students, a ballet theatre and a cathedral that had withstood the last century’s darkest moments. In a few savage days Kharkiv has been transformed into a living hell. Many of the city’s inhabitants are currently sheltering underground in basements, metro stations, and ground-floor corridors. Russian forces have relentlessly bombarded the city this week, pulverising apartment blocks and other civilian targets and threatening to turn Kharkiv into a new Aleppo, which also faced Russian bombing, or Guernica. It has borne the brunt of Vladimir Putin’s rage. “There is bombing the whole day, from morning to evening, ever since the invasion last week,” Padalko, a communications manager, told the Guardian. “Our flat is shaking and vibrating. We have the feeling Putin wants to kill us totally, absolutely completely. It’s awful. He’s really crazy. Nobody can understand why he does this.” She added: “Kharkiv was the best place to live in Ukraine. Now we are terrified to look out of our windows.” At 8am on Tuesday Russia bombed the main administration building in Kharkiv in Freedom Square. Several cars were going past. The building was destroyed. At least 10 people were killed. It has targeted schools, residential neighbourhoods, the zoo with its lions and elephants, government offices, the theatre, and the city’s Assumption Cathedral – part of the Moscow patriarchy – where locals had taken refuge. Dozens have died. The ferocious attack is being carried out with deadly weapons: BM-30 Smerch heavy multiple rocket launchers and, increasingly, bomber planes. On Sunday Russian light armoured vehicles made an unsuccessful attempt to enter and to grab the city. Now Putin appears to have decided to flatten it instead. The message seems demonstrative. It is directed at the defiant government of Ukraine’s pro-western president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy: you and Kyiv are next. It is hard to disagree with Zelenskiy’s grim assessment made in a speech earlier this week that Russia was seeking to “erase” Ukraine and remove it from Europe’s map. “Russia is fighting with a deliberate violation of all conventions, laws and rules of war, trying to cause maximum damage, to civilian and critical infrastructure and to ordinary people,” the presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. Moscow’s goal was panic and to cause a refugee crisis, he added. “There are many destroyed houses. We are underground, hiding in our local metro station,” said Maya Mironova from Kharkiv, speaking on her mobile. “There are about a thousand people here. Women, children and also pets, cats and dogs.” Mironova said volunteers had organised food points; some of her friends were in basements elsewhere in her Kharkiv tractor factory district; during breaks in the shelling she was able to dash back to her home. “Putin didn’t realise his ambition to take Kharkiv. It’s the former capital of Soviet Ukraine. It’s symbolic for him. He counted on people’s loyalty to Russia and didn’t get it. And so he’s furious. He wants to bomb us so we surrender,” she said. How long could Kharkiv hold out against unbridled Russian firepower? “We won’t surrender. The Ukrainian army is defending. They are here. But I’m afraid Putin will destroy us,” she said. Across Ukraine similar bleak scenes were being played out. Russian tanks have encircled Mariupol, the once-prosperous port city on the Sea of Azov. Shelling has killed dozens, destroyed the heating and water supply, and left tens of thousands of people shivering in basements, cold and terrified. “They do not plan to occupy the city. They plan to ruin it with grads that do not stop,” a resident, Diana Berg, wrote on her Facebook page. She added: “It’s the third day all city is left with no electricity, heat, water and any type of connection. Even radio is being blocked. Shelling is non-stop. The only news you can get is the direction of the bomb. People go out into their backyards to make a fire in order to get a little warmth. The humanitarian blockade is terrifying. It’s unbearable. We are in the dark with no understanding of what is going on with our relatives.” Berg on Friday said she had managed to leave the city – a “miraculous” journey during which she and her husband, Sasha, drove towards and then past a phalanx of 20 Russian tanks and armoured vehicles. “One turned its canon towards us. But for some fucking reason it didn’t fucking shoot us,” she messaged friends incredulously. She apologised for her bad language, saying: “I’ve been swearing for a week now.” Other urban areas hit by Putin’s missiles resemble a dark phantasmagoria as imagined by Hieronymus Bosch. A missile strike on Thursday hit an apartment block in Chernihiv, north of Kyiv, killing 47 people and injuring 18. Video shows bright orange flames, black smoke, broken cars, twisted bodies lying on the street amid rubble, and the piercing, inconsolable scream of a woman. It is a medieval hell, made real by 21st-century Moscow. For now, the capital, Kyiv, is holding firm amid what one former Ukrainian minister described as a “multidirectional raid” by Russia’s army, air force and navy. In the run-up to the invasion little was done to build the city’s defences. Now anti-tank hedgehog traps have been placed along Khreshchatyk, Kyiv’s main boulevard, with its Nike outlets and branch of McDonald’s. The city centre is preternaturally quiet, empty, residents say. There are explosions and birdsong Refugees continue to leave for the west of the country and the relative safety of Lviv, close to the Polish border. Olya Zolotorova, 42, said she had fled her home in the southern city of Mykolaiv, together with her husband and six-year-old son, Leo. Russian troops had blockaded the city but had so far failed to storm it, she said. Its natural geography – Mykolaiv is surrounded by a river on three sides – made it easier to defend from marauding tanks, she said. Zolotorova said she was appalled by the destruction of Kharkiv and other historic cities. “It’s revenge. Putin thought he could capture Ukraine in three days. Now he’s punishing civilians because of his failure.” Nobody could get in or out of Mykolaiv now, she said, adding Russian marines were seeking to storm nearby Odesa, the country’s third-biggest city, and were landing from the Black Sea. “This is one of the most barbaric wars in human history. Just a fucking Mordor,” Illia Ponomarenko, the defence correspondent for the Kyiv Independent, tweeted. Others who escaped Kyiv agreed. “Someone needs to kill Putin. When he is dead this war will stop,” Nikita Perfiliev, a digital marketer, said, sipping a cup of coffee outside a Lviv cafe. A home-drawn poster in its window said: “Fuck off Russian warship” – a message broadcast by Ukrainian sailors and now a meme. “Kharkiv was special. It’s even hard to talk about it,” said Artem Mazhulin, a 31-year-old English teacher. “We had a ferris wheel, a rollercoaster and a cable car in Gorky Park. I went round the new zoo when it opened and saw ostriches and zebras.” Mazhulin said he left Kharkiv on Tuesday, getting on a train packed with students from Nigeria, India and Morocco, with about 100 people in one carriage. The journey to Kyiv was scary, he said, until the train finally crossed to the right bank of the capital and kept going. “We then stopped at towns and villages. People came to the train windows and gave us home-preserved vegetables and water,” he said. What would happen next? Could Ukraine win the war? Would it survive? “We can’t just give up,” he said. “Our spirit is very high.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/dec/12/the-lights-are-on-so-far-but-letting-gas-supplies-dwindle-was-a-risky-bet","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-12T19:23:03Z","webTitle":"The lights are on so far, but letting gas supplies dwindle was a risky bet | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/dec/12/the-lights-are-on-so-far-but-letting-gas-supplies-dwindle-was-a-risky-bet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/dec/12/the-lights-are-on-so-far-but-letting-gas-supplies-dwindle-was-a-risky-bet","fields":{"headline":"The lights are on so far, but letting gas supplies dwindle was a risky bet","bodyText":"The good news – sort of – is that the energy market worked on Monday. Supply met demand and the lights stayed on. National Grid did not even have to deploy the two coal-fired plants that it had instructed to get warmed up. Those plants, remember, are only intended to be used as a last resort “when all commercial options have been exhausted”. In this case, the commercial option of paying through the nose to secure balancing supplies from French nuclear stations, or elsewhere, must have been available. The bad news is that it’s only mid-December and there may be more cold and calm days ahead this winter. Indeed, some figures in the energy industry were surprised that National Grid even got as far as putting the coal plants on emergency standby. They had assumed an alert would be more likely to be triggered by, say, an unexpected outage within the UK’s nuclear power fleet (which was humming at full capacity on Monday for the first time this winter). Not for the first time, then, we have cause to regret that successive UK governments allowed the UK’s gas storage capacity to dwindle. For about a decade and a half before the mothballing of Centrica’s Rough facility off east Yorkshire in 2017, ministers operated under the delusion that the market would always provide short, medium and long-term supplies at reasonable prices. Even as late as 2019, the business and energy department officially fretted that subsidies for storage would undermine the economics of LNG terminals and interconnectors to the continent. The bet was reckless in many ways, one of which was the inability to change course quickly if events do not pan out as expected. Amid the fanfare that has surrounded the reopening of Rough, don’t lose sight of the fact that its capacity will be only 30bn cubic feet this winter, which is about three days’ reserves at peak demand. Once upon a time, Rough could hold five times as much. Sadly, it’s not possible to flick a switch and get the old capacity back. Centrica reckons a £150m investment, with any losses underwritten by a government contract in effect, would get Rough to 60bn cubic feet of gas by next winter. Then the company talks about a grander £1bn vision to restore Rough properly, or £2bn to allow eventual conversion to become the world’s largest hydrogen storage facility. The big and long-term investment decisions may not have to be taken immediately, but it’s not too soon to plan for next winter. The UK has a lot of storage capacity to recover. Centrica’s negotiating hand is improving with the icy weather. LSEG’s tie-up with Microsoft risks blurred lines A ten-year “strategic partnership” with one of the world’s largest technology companies was always going to be given maximum hype by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). And, sure enough, chief executive David Schwimmer reached for the superlatives to describe the tie-up with Microsoft: a “significant milestone” that will “transform the experience” for LSEG customers and “meaningfully” boost revenues, he said. Since LSEG didn’t define “meaningful”, it’s hard to know what the financial yardstick for success is supposed to be. But, yes, this is a clearly a serious attempt by the LSEG to upgrade Refinitiv, the international data business it bought in 2020 for $27bn (£22bn), and close the “credibility gap”, as analysts put it, with Bloomberg’s instant-messaging capability. All being well, there’ll be less need for customers to flick between different programmes. And, having shelled out such a huge sum for Refinitiv, LSEG had to show a plan to accelerate growth. The odd part, though, is why Microsoft is also buying a 4% stake (from the Blackstone/Thomson Reuters consortium that was the seller in the all-share Refinitiv transaction) and being given a seat on the LSEG board. The intention, presumably, is to demonstrate that the deal is more than just a product-development gig, but the risk is a blurring of governance lines. Microsoft is at once a seller of services to LSEG – to the tune of a guaranteed $2.8bn over the next decade – and also in the happy position of having a representative in the boardroom of its customer. If sweet harmony prevails and a suite of impressive new analytical tools appears, there won’t be a problem. But the deal is not exclusive. LSEG can work with other tech firms, and Microsoft can sell elsewhere. If one side ends up disappointed in the others’ efforts, the governance set-up will look messy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/09/fears-environment-bills-could-sidelined-tory-leadership-race","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-09T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Fears environment bills could be sidelined amid Tory leadership race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/09/fears-environment-bills-could-sidelined-tory-leadership-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/09/fears-environment-bills-could-sidelined-tory-leadership-race","fields":{"headline":"Fears environment bills could be sidelined amid Tory leadership race","bodyText":"Crucial environment legislation must not be allowed to be sidelined or abandoned amid the distraction of a Tory leadership race, campaigners have warned. Ministers openly admit they do not know what is going on with much of the legislation, but those who remain in government are working with skeleton teams to get bills in shape to be passed. Two ministers at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) have quit so far, Rebecca Pow and Jo Churchill, both of whom were working on environment legislation making its way through parliament. Churchill resigned on Wednesday but on Thursday she was supposed to be in committees about a gene editing bill that would liberalise rules around genetic modification for crops and potentially livestock. The Guardian has been told this has now been passed to the minister Victoria Prentis, who has not resigned. Prentis says she believes it is her duty to stay in government and get bills passed, rather than quit. Sources close to her say those remaining in Defra are “working flat out” because “the environment cannot wait until October”, which is when Boris Johnson’s allies have suggested he should remain prime minister until. Bills experts are particularly worried about include the environmental land management scheme, which has faced criticism from the Tory right as well as from Labour and the Liberal Democrats. This legislation would reward farmers for conserving nature, and Defra sources say net zero will not be reached without this new subsidy system. Other, newer bills under threat include the highly protected marine areas consultation, which would ban all fishing in some fragile ecosystems in England’s seas. This work was under Pow’s purview and is only in the consultation phase. It is unpopular with many in the fishing industry and could be junked. Other departments are also in turmoil. After Michael Gove was sacked as levelling up secretary he was replaced by Greg Clark. Clark is now being given the task of deciding on the proposed Whitehaven coalmine in Cumbria but has not worked in the department for years. On Thursday the government also announced it was postponing for a second time a decision on whether to approve the £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk. The levelling up bill is also coming soon and campaigners say the legislation contains a number of threats to the ability of communities to demand higher environmental protection and standards in the planning system, replaces key environmental rules and fails to align plans with climate legislation. The treasury, with its new chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, is to decide whether to go ahead with a windfall tax on oil and gas companies. A decision on this is due next week, and while it is a popular measure with voters it is unknown whether Zahawi will press ahead with it, and whether he will remove the loophole that would provide tax relief for new oil and gas. There could also be a wait of some time for a government response to the fracking review. The British Geological Survey has given its report on the safety and feasibility of fracking to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), but the results will not be seen until the government responds to it, with BEIS sources saying they do not know when that will be. BEIS will also have to deal with the cost of living and energy crises, with insulation measures and direct support for the poorest households the most urgent priority. The energy security bill is also coming, with an opportunity to overhaul the energy market so the low cost of renewable electricity feeds through to consumers. The Cop president, Alok Sharma, has not quit but is drawing on the talents of a much-diminished cabinet and a government in chaos. The UK still holds the presidency until Cop27 in November and the government has yet to decide on the formal emission-cutting pledges to be made. What is more, a judgment on a judicial review of the net zero strategy is expected this month. Depending on what it finds, it may add even more work to the in trays of the remaining environment team. Greenpeace UK’s policy director, Doug Parr, said: “No matter how dire things may seem in Westminster right now, when it comes to the climate crisis things risk getting much worse without immediate action. However, delays to decisions on whether or not to backtrack on coal and build a new mine, or waste untold time and money on a new nuclear power station that will only distract from genuine energy solutions, could be taken as positive, if they were set to be given the green light as rumours suggest. “This parliamentary reset must deliver a new prime minister that will take bolder action on climate and nature. They must invest in real solutions like cheap, clean, homegrown renewables and fixing the vast number of cold, damp, energy-wasting homes. If not, we may lose even more time and find ourselves in a far worse position than we already are.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/22/bp-declines-reveal-how-much-loophole-saved-windfall-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-22T17:57:11Z","webTitle":"BP declines to reveal how much ‘loophole’ saved it in windfall tax ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/22/bp-declines-reveal-how-much-loophole-saved-windfall-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/22/bp-declines-reveal-how-much-loophole-saved-windfall-tax","fields":{"headline":"BP declines to reveal how much ‘loophole’ saved it in windfall tax ","bodyText":"BP declined to reveal how much windfall tax it would have paid without an investment “loophole” when being questioned by MPs on Tuesday, while fellow energy group SSE raised concerns the levy “favours” oil and gas drilling over renewables projects. Appearing before MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee, the BP vice-president Matthew Williamson said he did not know how much the firm would have paid without an investment allowance that reduces the windfall tax due if a company invests in North Sea oil and gas extraction. He also declined to say how much BP was spending on renewable energy projects this year. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, last week slashed the investment allowance. Companies can only reduce their windfall tax bill by 29% of funds invested in extraction, down from the previous 80% discount. Hunt also increased the tax rate of the levy from 25% to 35% and extended its lifetime by two years. In a testy exchange, the BEIS committee chair, Darren Jones, asked: “If it wasn’t for the loophole that was put in for investment into drilling for further oil and gas, how much more tax would you have paid this financial year?” Williamson replied: “Our tax and financial teams will be working that out so I don’t have an answer for that today.” Jones also asked how the $8.5bn (£7.15bn) BP has earmarked to buy back its own shares compares with its investment in low carbon technology. Williamson said: “All I can say is for this year we’re looking at approximately 30% of spend for non-hydrocarbon investment, I don’t have the breakdown for renewables.” Jones said the questions had been sent to BP before the hearing and said he was “shocked” Williamson could not answer them. Jones asked whether Williamson had requested the numbers from his team. “No I did not,” Williamson said. The scale of BP’s investment in renewables projects has been under the spotlight this year. The company has committed to spend £18bn in the UK by the end of the decade but has been urged to reinvest booming profits in greater spending on green energy. BP invested £300m into renewables and “low carbon” projects in the first half of 2022 – the equivalent of just 2.5% of its £12.2bn profits. BP said this month that it expected to pay $2.5bn as a result of the windfall tax, known as the energy profits levy, before it was updated by Hunt. Rival Shell caused anger when it said it had paid no windfall tax because of heavy spending on oil and gas drilling. Separately, the chancellor introduced a 45% levy on electricity generators aimed at the “excess returns” seen by renewable and nuclear power companies as electricity is tied to soaring gas prices. Catherine Raw, the managing director of the power firm SSE’s thermal division, told MPs the investment allowance for oil and gas firms risked Britain’s efforts to decarbonise the energy industry. Raw said: “It feels like an unintended consequence and slightly counterintuitive that effectively investment by oil and gas companies is favoured to investment by renewables companies.” Raw called for the government to speed up plans to help power firms build business models that incorporate hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. Asked whether the UK was on track to phase out “unabated gas”, without attached carbon storage project by 2035, Raw said: “If we continue at the pace we’re at today, the answer is probably no.” She said: “When we look at our own fleet we see two power stations continue to operate post-2030.” She said the phase-out over other power stations would rely on the development of hydrogen and CCS. Will Gardiner, the chief executive of Drax, was forced to defend the £11bn in renewable subsidies it is expected to have collected by 2027. The subsidy for the UK’s largest power station was called “utterly bizarre” by Dr Daniel Quiggin, a researcher at the Chatham House thinktank who also appeared before the committee. Gardiner said: “We’ve reduced the emissions from 20m tonnes or more to around three and I think that’s a significant achievement for the UK and we’ve contributed to the decarbonisation effectively using the system the government has designed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/ukraine-backs-plan-for-international-tribunal-to-try-putin-for-of-aggression","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T15:13:02Z","webTitle":"Ukraine backs international tribunal plan to try Putin for crime of aggression","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/ukraine-backs-plan-for-international-tribunal-to-try-putin-for-of-aggression","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/ukraine-backs-plan-for-international-tribunal-to-try-putin-for-of-aggression","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine backs international tribunal plan to try Putin for crime of aggression","bodyText":"Ukraine’s foreign minister has backed the establishment of a special international tribunal to try Russia’s leaders for the crime of aggression against Ukrainians. The move is separate from the claim launched by 39 countries this week to hold Russia to account at the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, is starting an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the conduct of the war. The crime of aggression, by contrast, would give rise to prosecution under international law by allowing the instigators of the aggression to be put on trial regardless of how the war was conducted. The ICC cannot also have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, unless the Russian state agrees, which it would veto at the UN. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, speaking from the back of a car in Ukraine via video link to an event at London’s Chatham House on Friday, said: “We are fighting against an enemy that is much stronger than us. But international law is on our side, and hopefully it will make its own contribution to help us prevail. The question now is how the international community will respond. “An international tribunal will fill a gap. When bombs fall on your cities, when Russian soldiers rape women in the occupied cities, it is difficult to talk of the efficiency of international law. But it is the only tool of civilisation that is available to us so in the end all those that made this war possible are held to account. We need to fill the gap of the crime against aggression.” He recalled that 80 years ago representatives from nine nations met in London to set up a legal framework for the prosecution of war criminals of the second world war. The former prime minister Gordon Brown, one of the advocates of the plan, said the possibility of bringing Vladimir Putin to trial was realistic. He said the tribunal, modelled on the Nuremberg trials after the second world war, would investigate all those who planned the invasion and were complicit, including by providing finance. Brown said: “Buildings are being razed to the ground but not the spirit of the Ukrainian people, and by acting in solidarity with them we will signal that lawless aggression will not be tolerated anywhere on European soil.” The call on nations to agree to set up the tribunal has support from international lawyers, barristers and former judges, including Richard Goldstone, the former chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Philippe Sands QC said it was clear that sanctions alone would not work. “If we are committed to standing up to a lawless naked act of aggression, we must not leave a stone unturned. When Charles de Gaulle met in London in 1942 it must have been unimaginable that Hitler would be put in the dock three years later.” He implied the existence of the tribunal might in itself weaken the support base of the Russian president, saying: “The imminence of the Nuremberg trials in 1945 led some in the inner circle to ask, ‘Do I really want to be associated with this? Am I willing to break ranks and to cut deals?’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/nov/11/rolls-royce-vows-to-create-6000-uk-jobs-with-nuclear-power-station-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-11T08:40:52Z","webTitle":"Rolls-Royce vows to create 6,000 UK jobs with nuclear power station plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/11/rolls-royce-vows-to-create-6000-uk-jobs-with-nuclear-power-station-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/nov/11/rolls-royce-vows-to-create-6000-uk-jobs-with-nuclear-power-station-plans","fields":{"headline":"Rolls-Royce vows to create 6,000 UK jobs with nuclear power station plans","bodyText":"Rolls-Royce says it can create 6,000 UK jobs within five years if the government backs its plans to build small nuclear reactors around the country. The engineering company is part of a consortium that is pushing for the government to commit billions of pounds to build 16 of the small modular reactors (SMRs) around the UK. The factory-built nuclear power stations are predicted to provide up to 440MW of electricity each, enough to power a city of 450,000 homes over a planned lifespan of 60 years. The UK SMR Consortium, which also includes the building company Laing O’Rourke and the National Nuclear Laboratory, among others, said the reactors can play a major part in the UK’s efforts to fight the climate crisis with zero direct emissions, as well as boosting UK exports. However, it faces opposition on the grounds of safety, security and cost. The consortium this week signed agreements with the US company Exelon Generation and the Czech power company CEZ to consider the reactors. Small nuclear reactors were first developed in the 1950s to use in nuclear-powered submarines. Since then Rolls-Royce has designed reactors for seven classes of submarine and two separate land-based prototype reactors. However, to be cost-effective for civilian use the power generated by the reactors has to compete with renewable sources such as wind and solar power. The costs of installing renewables have fallen dramatically in the last decade and they do not pose the same safety concerns. The Financial Times last month reported that the government was backing the plans to commit between £1.5bn and £2bn, and that it would form part of Boris Johnson’s 10-point plan for the environment. However, the second wave of coronavirus has caused the delay of the Treasury’s multiyear spending review. Proponents argue the plants could be built in factories and then rapidly and cheaply assembled where needed around the UK. An independent review in 2018 said the government should back the plans but a 2017 study by the consortium partner Atkins found that the electricity produced from the small reactors would be a third more expensive than traditional plants. Tom Samson, the interim chief executive of the UK SMR Consortium, said: “We have developed a manufacturing and assembly process that will make reliable, low-carbon nuclear power affordable, deliverable and investable. “By creating a factory-built power station that rolls off the assembly line we have radically reduced many construction risks associated with new nuclear power stations; and by using proven nuclear technology alongside standardised and simplified components, we make it much more cheaply.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-208-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-19T17:03:54Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 208 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-208-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-208-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 208 of the invasion","bodyText":"Thirteen people were killed by artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the city’s Russian-backed mayor said. Russian forces struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday, but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, said. The Kremlin has said that beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said on Monday during a visit to China. Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfit’s indecisive stance on economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will visit Saudi Arabia and meet the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesperson said on Monday, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies. The German central bank said on Monday it was increasingly likely that Europe’s largest economy would shrink for a “prolonged” period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province as a “lie”. Russia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of the Ukraine men’s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putin’s invading forces, the Guardian has revealed. The US president, Joe Biden, has warned Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other nonconventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a “consequential” response from the US. Russia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to about 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the British military said on Monday. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added it to the small group of countries excluded from Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral in London today, which includes Belarus, Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The Institute for the Study of War thinktank said Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, was “increasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units” in its latest update on the Russian campaign. The Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson region in the south, where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no letup in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia. In an intelligence update, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, including a power grid and a dam, had intensified. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion.

They are blindfolded: the latest prisoners to be captured inside Ukraine. A Ukrainian voice interrogates them. “Speak,” he says to the group’s Russian officer. What message would he like to send to his soldiers and to Russians back at home? “Frankly speaking, they tricked us,” the officer replies, referring to his military superiors sitting in Moscow. “Everything we were told was a fake. I would tell my guys to leave Ukrainian territory. We’ve got families and children. I think 90% of us would agree to go home.” The three-minute video was filmed under conditions of duress. The soldiers are evidently scared. And yet there are numerous similar interviews with Russian captives which have been circulating on Ukrainian social media channels, expressing similar sentiments. Asked what he would tell his commanders, one said bluntly: “They are faggots”. Another phrase frequently used is oni obmanuli nas: they duped us. Eight days after Vladimir Putin’s invasion it is clear that a significant number of his servicemen are demoralised and reluctant to fight. Some have given themselves up. Others have abandoned their vehicles and have set off back towards the Russian border on foot, lugging their weapons and kitbags, videos suggest. These episodes do not mean that the Kremlin will fail in its attempts to conquer Ukraine, as its tactics shift to brutal shelling of civilians. But low morale among invading troops might be one reason why Russia’s blitzkrieg plan to overwhelm Ukraine appears not to have progressed at the speed Putin would have wanted. The assumption in Moscow was that the operation would be swift and successful. Soldiers were given food and fuel supplies for only two or three days, the videos suggest. The Kremlin also appears to have had a totally fantastical idea of the reception they would get. Several prisoners of war said they had been assured Ukrainians would welcome them as liberators. Russian forces were expecting flowers and cheers, not bullets and bombs, they said. “Some of them thought they were on military exercises. They didn’t anticipate resistance,” Artem Mazhulin, a 31-year-old English teacher from Kharkiv said. “A lot are conscripts born in 2002 or 2003. We are talking about 19-year-old and 20-year-old boys.” He added: “Since 2014 the Russian government has been brainwashing its population with propaganda. They try and make Russia believe Ukraine is not a real country and say fascist monsters have captured it.” Mazhulin said his uncle and aunt, Viktor and Valentina, had talked with Russian soldiers when they rolled past their house in Kupiansk, in north-east Ukraine, close to the border. The soldiers explained they were looking for Banderivtsi, or followers of the second world war Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera. “My uncle said to them: ‘Where the fuck do you see Banderivtsi?’ My aunt told them to get off her flowerbeds,” Mazhulin recounted. “They called my uncle Batya (Dad) and chatted with him about pigeon breeding, his hobby. Then they drove off on their tank.” In a video address on Thursday Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy pressed home the same message: that Putin has sent his invading forces into Ukraine without an understandable mission. “They are demoralised. They are doomed,” he said, telling enemy soldiers to “go home”. Ukraine claims to have killed several thousand Russian troops. This figure may be an exaggeration, but on Wednesday, however, even the Kremlin admitted 498 of its servicemen had died, with 1,591 wounded. Alex Kovzhun, a one-time adviser to Ukraine’s former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, said Russian soldiers could be divided into two sorts: “There are the young conscripts who are scared shitless. And there are career guys who have fought in Syria and the Donbas.” Kovzhun said the Russian general staff had thought the invasion would be “easy peasy”, and a repeat of the operations to seize Crimea in 2014, or their recent deployment to Kazakhstan, which were largely unopposed. Instead, Ukrainian civilians had stood in front of enemy tanks, blocked armoured columns with their bare hands and had sung the national anthem in front of twitchy Russian guards. “They shout expletives in front of armed people. I’ve seen the Russian faces. They are very uncomfortable because it’s not what they expected. They were told Ukrainians were imprisoned by mythic Nazis,” he added. Nick Reynolds, a research analyst for land warfare at the defence and security think tank the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), said the Ukrainian figure for killed enemy soldiers was likely to be a more reliable than the Russian estimate, adding that the footage of engagements involving Russian forces available online suggested the toll the Kremlin was willing to admit to had already been exceeded. Nevertheless, he added, there is little to show how the Ukrainian authorities have arrived at their own total. The several thousand dead tally could itself be a slight exaggeration, he said. There is no doubt Ukraine is utilising the discomfort of captured soldiers for propaganda purposes. Several videos show young men calling their mothers back in Russia, who have no idea their sons are fighting in Ukraine. The mothers typically break down. The Ukrainian authorities have opened a hotline for worried Russian relatives, in another PR scoop. Nonetheless, there is an authentic sense that many Russian servicemen regret ever having come to Ukraine, a journey that has ended for some in death or disillusionment. One interrogator asks a prisoner: “So, what do you think, are you soldiers of the strong Russian army or cannon fodder?” “We are cannon fodder,” the PoW replies. “Was it worth it?” the interrogator says, by way of follow-up. “No,” the prisoner says.

Here is a summary of the day’s top news stories: The head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said one person had died as a result of the explosion earlier on Tuesday. Blasts rocked a Russian airbase near seaside resorts in the annexed Crimean peninsula, injuring five people according to local authorities. Witnesses told Reuters they heard at least 12 explosions at about 3.20pm local time from the Saky airbase near Novofedorivka on Crimea’s western coast. They described a final blast around 30 minutes later as the loudest. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power firm warned of the “very high” risks from shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-occupied south and said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in time for winter. Energoatom’s chief, Petro Kotin, told Reuters in an interview that last week’s Russian shelling had damaged three lines that connect the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Ukrainian grid and that Russia wanted to connect the facility to its grid. The leaders of Estonia and Finland want fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take holidays in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine. The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, wrote on Tuesday on Twitter that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right” and that it was “time to end tourism from Russia now”, the Associated Press reported. Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad has been struggling with quotas imposed by the EU for sanctioned goods that it can import across Lithuania from mainland Russia or Belarus, the region’s governor admitted. Lithuania infuriated Moscow in June by banning the land transit of goods such as concrete and steel to Kaliningrad after EU sanctions on them came into force, Reuters reported. Russia has launched an Iranian satellite from Kazakhstan amid concerns that it could be used for battlefield surveillance in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Iran has denied that the Khayyam satellite, which was delivered into orbit aboard a Soyuz rocket launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, would ever be under Russian control. Russia has suspended an arrangement that allowed US and Russian inspectors to visit each other’s nuclear weapons sites under the 2010 New Start treaty, in a fresh blow to arms control. Mutual inspections had been suspended as a health precaution since the start of the Covid pandemic, but a foreign ministry statement on Monday added another reason Russia is unwilling to restart them. It argued that US sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine stopped Russian inspectors travelling to the US. The global health aid agency Unitaid is donating 220 specialised portable breathing devices to Ukraine that can help save lives of premature babies even in frontline hospitals where there is no electrical power. During Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, hundreds of hospitals have been damaged or destroyed, disrupting supply lines and placing newborn babies at risk of death or disability from a lack of access to equipment and oxygen, Reuters reported. More than 10.5 million people have crossed the border from Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, the UN refugee agency UNHCR said on its website on Tuesday. Ukrainians have been fleeing their homes since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. In an interview, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said the advance of pro-Russian forces in the Donbas was developing in a northern direction, with fighting on the outskirts of Bakhmut and Soledar. He said that the DPR was in negotiations with Pyongyang to bring builders from North Korea in to help rebuild the occupied territory. Pushilin also stated that there would be an “open tribunal over the war criminals of Ukraine”, with the first to be held in Mariupol, which would feature the testimony of the “Azovites”, in reference to Ukraine’s Azov battalion. Russia’s assault towards the town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine has been its most successful axis in the Donbas region in the past month, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Despite this, it had only gained 10km in that time, while elsewhere in Donbas it had gained only 3km over 30 days – “almost certainly significantly less than planned”. That’s it for the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. I’ll be back tomorrow, see you then. A Russian airbase deep behind the frontline in Crimea was damaged by several large explosions on Tuesday afternoon, killing at least one person, although it was not immediately clear whether it had been targeted by a long range Ukrainian missile strike. Multiple social media videos showed explosions and clouds emerging from the Saky military base in Novofedorivka on the western coast of Crimea, prompting questions about how a location more than 100 miles from the frontline could have been attacked. Later a senior Ukrainian official appeared to claim responsibility, without giving details. Russia’s defence ministry told the RIA Novosti news agency that the explosions took place at about 3.20pm local time, and that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area. It said it was trying to discern the cause of the incident. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power firm warned of the “very high” risks of shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-occupied south and said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in time for winter. Energoatom’s chief, Petro Kotin, told Reuters in an interview that last week’s Russian shelling had damaged three lines that connect the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Ukrainian grid and that Russia wanted to connect the facility to its grid. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the site of the vast nuclear power station – Europe’s biggest – that lies in Russian-controlled territory, in recent days. Some of the shelling landed near storage facilities for spent fuel, an area that has 174 containers of highly radioactive material, Kotin said, warning of the dangers of them being hit. “This is … the most radioactive material in all the nuclear power plant. This would [mean] the distribution [of it] around this place and then we will have like a radiation cloud and then the weather will decide … which direction the cloud goes,” he said. “The risk is very high,” he said. Kotin said Russia wanted to connect the plant to its grid, a technically difficult process that requires the facility to be severed from the Ukrainian system before it can be gradually connected to the Russian one. The leaders of Estonia and Finland want fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take holidays in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine. Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, wrote on Tuesday on Twitter that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right” and that it is “time to end tourism from Russia now”, the Associated Press reported. A day earlier, her counterpart in Finland, Sanna Marin, told Finnish broadcaster YLE that “it is not right that while Russia is waging an aggressive, brutal war of aggression in Europe, Russians can live a normal life, travel in Europe, be tourists”. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, went further in a Washington Post interview on Monday, saying all western countries should ban Russian tourists. Estonia and Finland both border Russia and are members of the European Union, which banned air travel from Russia after it invaded Ukraine. But Russians can still travel by land to both countries and apparently are then taking flights to other European destinations. The Ukrainian military claims to have struck a major airbase deep inside the occupied Crimean peninsula. At least 12 explosions hit the Saky naval airbase, causing a huge plume of smoke. Russia has disputed the claims and says it was not an attack but a detonation of ammunition. The head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said one person has died as a result of the explosion earlier on Tuesday. Blasts rocked a Russian airbase near seaside resorts in the annexed Crimean peninsula, injuring five people according to local authorities. Witnesses told Reuters they heard at least 12 explosions at about 3.20pm local time from the Saky airbase near Novofedorivka on Crimea’s western coast. They described a final blast around 30 minutes later as the loudest. Russia’s defence ministry claimed the “detonation of several aviation ammunition stores” had caused an explosion, Russian news agencies reported, but that there had been no injuries. Russia has launched an Iranian satellite from Kazakhstan amid concerns that it could be used for battlefield surveillance in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Iran has denied that the Khayyam satellite, which was delivered into orbit aboard a Soyuz rocket launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, would ever be under Russian control. But the Washington Post had previously reported that Moscow told Tehran it “plans to use the satellite for several months, or longer, to enhance its surveillance of military targets” in Ukraine, according to two US officials. The satellite, named after the Persian poet and mathematician Omar Khayyam, was built by Russia and will include a high-resolution camera that would give Tehran new capabilities to monitor sensitive facilities in Israel and the Persian Gulf, the paper reported. Crimea’s emergency services said three people were injured as a result of the blast. The ministry of defence said earlier there were no casualties and no aircraft was damaged. The head of occupied Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said it was “too early” to talk about casualties, adding that medics were working on the ground. He said: Ambulance crews and medics are working on the spot, there are enough of them. It is too early to talk about casualties. Among the civilian population, no one has yet applied for medical assistance. Ukraine appears to have struck a major Russian airbase deep inside the occupied Crimean peninsula in what is being seen as a significant strike in a region regarded by Moscow as largely safe from attack. Video footage posted on Tuesday afternoon showed a series of large explosions at the Saky air force base located 200km behind the Russian front lines in Ukraine’s south. The Saky naval air station is located in Novofedorivka, and is the airbase associated with operations of Russian Black Sea fleet. What is significant about the attack is the distance of the location targeted behind Russian lines, suggesting both the use of ballistic missiles and that recent Ukrainian strikes on Russian air defences allowed the missiles to hit their target. Underlining the importance of the attack, Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at St Andrews University, tweeted: “What the Ukrainians are doing is extremely important. By showing they can hit Crimea, they will further stretch Russia defensive capabilities. The Russians are going to have to protect a huge area behind the front lines.” Reuters is carrying a little more details from the witness it has spoken to concerning the reports of explosions in Crimea. At least 12 explosions of varying intensity were heard in the course of a minute around 3.30pm local time, two witnesses said. Three were particularly loud, triggering sparks and smoke. (It is worth noting that the social media posts shared by Rodion Miroshnik placed the explosions slightly earlier, at 3pm local time – see post from 22 minutes ago) Around 30 minutes later, one more blast, described by witnesses as the loudest of all, triggered two more plumes of smoke and dust. In the nearby town of Saky, sirens blared. Reuters has distributed this image of the scene, which was taken from a third party. The Russian governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said in a post on his Telegram channel that he had gone to the area and that the “circumstances are being clarified”. An adviser to Aksyonov confirmed that explosions had occurred but declined to comment on the possible cause, Russian news agencies reported. Emergency services were deployed, the Tass news agency reported, citing the regional health ministry. Russia for decades leased the naval port of Sevastopol, home of its Black Sea Fleet, from Kyiv, but in 2014 annexed the entire peninsula from Ukraine in a move not recognised by most other countries. On Telegram, the Russian Tass news agency has posted that “the Association of Tour Operators of Russia said that the explosion in the Crimea occurred far from the resort area. There were no casualties or injuries among the tourists.” Authorities in Crimea appear to have been confirming reports of explosions in the region, although details are still scant. Oleg Kryuchkov, a Kremlin-appointed adviser to the authorities in Crimea, has posted to Telegram to say: “So far, I can only confirm the very fact of several explosions in the Novofedorivka area. I ask everyone to wait for official reports.” The BBC reports that pro-Russian military commander Yuri Kotenok said on his Telegram channel that there were about 10 explosions. “20km from Novofedorivka windows tremble and alarms go off in cars,” he wrote. It quotes another local authority figure as saying: “Our airfield is exploding. Explosions are at the airfield. All the windows here have been shattered.” The video clips which purport to show explosions in Crimea are being shared by pro-Russian social media as well as Ukrainian social media Rodion Miroshnik, who goes under the title of the ambassador to Russia for the self-proclaimed and chiefly unrecognised Luhansk People’s Republic, has forwarded a message on Telegram featuring two videos and a still image of the apparent explosions, accompanied by the message: Residents of Crimea report explosions near the village of Novofedorivka. The first explosion occurred at about 15:00 local time. There were a few more after it. Whether there are victims is unknown. Three local witnesses have told Reuters they heard several loud explosions and seen black smoke rising from the direction of a Russian military airbase at Novofedorivka in western Crimea on Tuesday. Videos shared on social media also showed a plume of smoke in the area. Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. More details soon … Global health aid agency Unitaid is donating 220 specialised portable breathing devices to Ukraine that can help save lives of premature babies even in frontline hospitals where there is no electrical power. During Russia’s invasion of Ukraine hundreds of hospitals have been damaged or destroyed, disrupting supply lines and placing newborn babies at risk of death or disability from a lack of access to equipment and oxygen, Reuters reported. Herve Verhoosel, a spokesperson for Unitaid, told a media briefing that the war was causing extra stress on pregnant women, leading to an increase in the number of premature births, which had tripled in some areas. The new bubble nasal continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) devices are available in 25 facilities across Ukraine, Verhoosel said. Unitaid funds medical innovation programmes mainly in poor countries, and is hosted by the World Health Organization. WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said that on a recent visit to a paediatric hospital close to the frontline in Ukraine she had seen medical staff who sleep in the basement every night, and constantly have to move children on ventilation machines. “So having very portable devices that can function offline is absolutely critical,” she told the briefing. Unitaid partnered with Vayu Global Health, a non-profit that specialises in low-cost healthcare equipment for developing countries, to provide the Kenya-made bCPAP machines, which cost about $500 each, as well as 125 oxygen blender systems. Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad has been struggling with quotas imposed by the European Union for sanctioned goods that it can import across Lithuania from mainland Russia or Belarus, the region’s governor admitted. Lithuania infuriated Moscow in June by banning the land transit of goods such as concrete and steel to Kaliningrad after EU sanctions on them came into force, Reuters reported. As part of a deal reached in July, the EU imposed limits on the volume of such goods crossing by land between Kaliningrad and mainland Russia or Belarus, based on average volumes over the last three years, to prevent Kaliningrad being used to dodge sanctions. Kaliningrad governor Anton Alikhanov estimated that the limits permit Russia to ship around 500,000 tonnes of sanctioned goods in total in both directions each year. But he said some quotas had already been reached, making it impossible, for instance, for Kaliningrad to import cement from Belarus – which used to account for around 200,000 tonnes a year. Moscow says trade with its outlying territory should not be subject to limits. “Today, we have already exhausted the limits set by Europeans for the transportation of goods by rail: for instance, certain kinds of iron, steel, oil products, fertilisers, antifreeze and timber,” Russian news agencies quoted Alikhanov as saying at a meeting of the Valdai discussion club on Tuesday. Russia’s former ambassador to Lithuania said that, while the transit deal had helped avoid the “worst case scenario”, the situation was “far from normal”. More than 10.5 million people have crossed the border from Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said on its website on Tuesday. Ukrainians have been fleeing their homes since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. Russia’s defence ministry said on Tuesday that Russian forces had destroyed an ammunition depot near Uman in Ukraine storing US-made Himars missiles and M777 howitzers, the RIA Novosti news agency reported. The Reuters news agency was unable to verify the battlefield reports. In its daily briefing, the ministry said it had destroyed more than 300 rockets in the strike. Kyiv has hailed the arrival of the advanced, long-range Himars from the United States as a possible game-changer, while Moscow has accused the West of “dragging out” the conflict by arming Ukraine. Russia has suspended an arrangement that allowed US and Russian inspectors to visit each other’s nuclear weapons sites under the 2010 New Start treaty, in a fresh blow to arms control. Mutual inspections had been suspended as a health precaution since the start of the Covid pandemic, but a foreign ministry statement on Monday added another reason Russia is unwilling to restart them. It argued that US sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine stopped Russian inspectors travelling to the US. Ukraine has reported intense Russian shelling across the frontlines on Tuesday as both sides traded blame for the weekend strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex that triggered international concern about a potential atomic disaster. Heavy fighting was reported in frontline towns near the eastern city of Donetsk, where Ukrainian officials said Russian troops were launching waves of attacks. In an interview, the self-appointed leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin, said the advance of pro-Russian forces in the Donbas is developing in a northern direction, with fighting going on on the outskirts of Bakhmut and Soledar. He said that the DPR was in negotiations with Pyongyang to bring builders from North Korea in to help rebuild the occupied territory. Pushilin also stated that there would be an “open tribunal over the war criminals of Ukraine”, with the first to be held in Mariupol, which would feature the testimony of the “Azovites”, in reference to Ukraine’s Azov battalion. Russia’s assault towards the town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine has been its most successful axis in the Donbas region in the past month, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Despite this, it had gained only 10km in that time, while elsewhere in Donbas it had gained only 3km over 30 days – “almost certainly significantly less than planned”. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-imposed military-civilian administration in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, has said: “Kherson region is ready to repel the attempts of the offensive by Ukrainian militants, if such a criminal order is given. Reliable protection of the borders of the region is provided by the Russian ministry of defence.” Two further grain-carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Chornomorsk port on Tuesday, as part of the deal to unblock Ukrainian sea exports. The Ocean Lion, which departed for South Korea, is carrying 64,720 tonnes of corn, it said, while the Rahmi Yağcı is carrying 5,300 tonnes of sunflower meal to Istanbul. Four ships that left Ukraine earlier are anchored near Istanbul and will be inspected on Tuesday, the Turkish defence ministry said. Belarus, where Russian troops were positioned to hold joint exercises before they invaded Ukraine from the north in February, has announced it is to hold live fire military training exercises both in Belarus and in Russia during August. Russia launched an Iranian satellite into orbit on Tuesday on morning, but Tehran has sought to deflect suspicions that Moscow could use Khayyam to improve its surveillance of military targets in Ukraine. The US believes Russia has suffered between 70,000 and 80,000 casualties, either killed or wounded, since its latest invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon’s top policy official, said: “The Russians are taking a tremendous number of casualties on the other side of the equation. I think it’s safe to suggest that the Russians are probably taking 70-80,000 casualties in less than six months.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has again accused the Russian Federation of terrorism. He posted to Telegram a selection of images showing damage to buildings and wheat fields in Ukraine with the message: The only difference between terrorists and Russia is that the first ones take responsibility for what they have done, while Russia does not have the courage to do so and has the audacity to blame others for its crimes – individual countries and the whole world. And now this world faces a choice. Determination, and therefore – an end to the crimes and atrocities of Russia, or another explosion of another bomb from these terrorists. The Telegram channel of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) is carrying a summary of an interview conducted with self-appointed leader Denis Pushilin. In it, he claims that the advance of pro-Russian forces in the Donbas is developing in a northern direction, with fighting going on on the outskirts of Bakhmut and Soledar. In Pisky, he said, “the cleanup is being completed”. Pushilin repeated the allegation that the deaths of Ukrainian prisoners of war at a Russian-controlled prison in Olenivka were caused by Ukrainian forces, saying: “Its implementation was controlled from the decision-making centres in Ukraine”. Ukraine has claimed the opposite, with satellite images suggesting that the building was destroyed not by a Himars strike from outside but either by a precision strike or by a detonation inside. He said the DPR was in negotiations with Pyongyang to bring in builders from North Korea to help rebuild the occupied territory. Pushilin also stated that there would be an “open tribunal over the war criminals of Ukraine”, with the first to be held in Mariupol, which would feature the testimony of the “Azovites”, in reference to Ukraine’s Azov battalion. The comments were made during a 20-minute section of Vladimir Solovyov’s live show. Only Russia, Syria and North Korea recognise the DPR as a legitimate authority, or Pushilin as a legitimate leader. Belarus, where Russian troops were positioned to hold joint exercises before they invaded Ukraine from the north in February, has announced it is to hold military training exercises during August. Reuters reports the defence ministry said the exercises will involve live firing and be held in two stages, firstly from 9-11 August in Belarus, and then at the Ashuluk training base in Russia from 22-25 August. The Ashuluk testing range is in the Astrakhan region of southern Russia, which borders Kazakhstan and the Caspian Sea. On Telegram, Ukraine’s emergency services have detailed some of the evacuation work it carried out in the last 24 hours. It said: Over the past day, emergency workers evacuated six people from Kramatorsk and Bakhmut districts. Rescuers from Donetsk region also helped 102 people during the evacuation in the city of Toretsk, including 10 children and 10 people with disabilities. During the evacuation at the railway station in Pokrovsk, assistance was provided to 735 people, including 69 children and nine people with physical disabilities. Also updating the public on evacuation numbers, Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, said 161 people arrived in his region from the east of the country on two evacuation trains in the last 24 hours. He stated that 747 people departed from the Lviv region to Przemyśl in Poland. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has issued its military briefing for the day. It says that Ukrainian forces shelled 10 of the 266 settlements that it claims to have “liberated” from Ukraine alongside Russia and the similarly self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic. The DPR is recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states including Russia, and its claims have not been independently verified. Here is an image sent to us over the newswires of the Liberian-flagged ship Ocean Lion, which departed from Ukraine’s Chornomorsk earlier today carrying 64,720 tonnes of corn. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukraine’s mayor of the occupied city of Sievierodonetsk, has been speaking on Ukrainian television about what he knows of the the conditions there. He described the situation, saying that occupation authorities are trying to create a picture of the restoration of normal life, and teams are being formed in the city to clean the streets, with the offer of food as payment for labour. He claimed there is no running water and the sewage system does not work either. He said the city lacks the specialists to restore communications. He also claimed that almost all the people who tried to return to the city, stayed there for several days, then realised that it would be impossible to overwinter in these conditions, and they left again. A clip of Stryuk’s interveiw was posted to Telegram by Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, Serhai Haidai. The claims have not been independently verified. NewsGuard, a New York-based firm that studies and tracks online misinformation, has identified 250 websites actively spreading Russian disinformation about the war, with dozens of new sites added in recent months. They appear to be part of a concerted effort to circumvent the European Union’s efforts to block Russian propaganda and misinformation about the war. Claims on these sites include allegations that Ukraine’s army has staged some deadly Russian attacks to generate global support, that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is faking public appearances, or that Ukrainian refugees are committing crimes in Germany and Poland. Some of the sites pose as independent thinktanks or news outlets. About half are English-language, while others are in French, German or Italian. Many were set up long before the war and were not obviously tied to the Russian government until they suddenly began echoing Kremlin talking points. “They may be establishing sleeper sites,” said NewsGuard co-CEO Gordon Crovitz. Sleeper sites are websites created for a disinformation campaign that lay largely dormant, slowly building an audience through innocuous or unrelated posts, and then switching to propaganda or disinformation at an appointed time. While NewsGuard’s analysis found that much of the disinformation about the war in Ukraine is coming from Russia, it did find instances of false claims with a pro-Ukrainian slant. YouTube, TikTok and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, all pledged to remove RT and Sputnik from their platforms within the European Union. But the Associated Press reports that researchers have found that in some cases all Russia had to do to evade the ban was to post the same content from a different account. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-imposed military-civilian administration in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, has spoken to the RIA Novosti news agency. He said that the forces in occupied Kherson are ready to defend themselves against any attempt by the Ukrainians to retake the region. It quotes him saying: The Kherson region is ready to repel the attempts of the offensive by Ukrainian militants, if such a criminal order is given to them by the regime of Zelenskiy, who is ready to wage war to the last Ukrainian for the sake of destroying the country. Reliable protection of the borders of the region is provided by the Russian ministry of defence. Here are some of the latest images to be distributed from Ukraine on the newswires. Reuters reports that the Turkish defence ministry has said two further grain-carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Chornomorsk port on Tuesday, as part of the deal to unblock Ukrainian sea exports. The Ocean Lion, which departed for South Korea, is carrying 64,720 tonnes of corn, it said, while the Rahmi Yağcı is carrying 5,300 tonnes of sunflower meal to Istanbul. The four ships that left Ukraine earlier are anchored near Istanbul and will be inspected on Tuesday, the defence ministry statement said. Rodion Miroshnik, who is styled as the ambassador to Russia for the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, has claimed on Telegram that four people were killed yesterday in the territory occupied by the similarly self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic in occupied Ukraine. He also states that 17 more were injured “of which one was blown up by a PFM-1 ‘petal’ mine”. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine is a signatory to the 1997 Ottawa convention, which aims to prohibit the stockpiling and use of anti-personnel mines such as the Soviet-designed PFM-1. Russia is not. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged western nations to ban entry of all Russian citizens. In an interview with the Washington Post, Zelenskiy said the most important sanctions against Russia would be to close borders, “because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. He said Russians should “live in their own world until they change their philosophy”. Russia’s assault towards the town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine has been its most successful axis in the Donbas region in the past month, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Despite this, it had only gained 10km in that time, while elsewhere in Donbas it had gained only 3km over 30 days – “almost certainly significantly less than planned”. With Russia and Ukraine trading accusations over endangering the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, and the head of the UN saying that attacks on the station were “suicidal”, we prepared this explainer on what’s at stake. Russia is scheduled to launch an Iranian satellite into orbit on Tuesday, but Tehran has brushed off fears that Moscow might use it in the war against Ukraine. Iran’s Khayyam satellite is scheduled to take off from the Moscow-operated Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 05:52 GMT, three weeks after Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, met Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Tehran. Iran has sought to deflect suspicions that Moscow could use Khayyam to improve its surveillance of military targets in Ukraine. Last week, the Washington Post quoted anonymous western intelligence officials as saying that Russia “plans to use the satellite for several months or longer” to assist its war efforts before allowing Iran to take control. But the Iranian Space Agency said on Sunday that the Islamic republic would control the Khayyam satellite “from day one”. The US believes Russia has suffered between 70,000 and 80,000 casualties, either killed or wounded, since its invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon’s top policy official said: “The Russians are taking a tremendous number of casualties on the other side of the equation. I think it’s safe to suggest that the Russians are probably taking 70 or 80,000 casualties in less than six months.” Kahl admitted that the Ukraine side also had significant losses of manpower on the battlefield, but gave no figures. “Both sides are taking casualties. The war is the most intense conventional conflict in Europe since the second world war,” he said. Ukraine has reported intense Russian shelling across the frontlines on Tuesday as both sides traded blame for the weekend strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex that triggered international concern about a potential atomic disaster. Heavy fighting was reported in frontline towns near the eastern city of Donetsk, where Ukrainian officials said Russian troops were launching waves of attacks. “The situation in the region is tense - shelling is constant throughout the front line ... The enemy is also using air strikes a great deal,” Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko told Ukrainian television. “The enemy is having no success. Donetsk region is holding.” In the south-east, the key Antonovsky bridge over the Dnieper River in Kherson region was targeted again by Ukrainian forces trying to disrupt Russian supply lines. Yuri Sobolevsky, deputy head of Kherson regional council ousted by Russian occupation forces, said on Telegram the bridge had been seriously damaged after “overnight actions”. Good morning, and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These are the latest developments Ukraine has arrested two people working for Russian intelligence services who planned to kill the Ukrainian defence minister and the head of the country’s military intelligence agency, Ukraine’s domestic security service said on Monday. The security service of Ukraine foiled the plot by the Russian GRU military intelligence agency to use a sabotage group to carry out three murders including that of a prominent Ukrainian activist, the agency said. The US will provide an additional $4.5bn (£3.7bn) to Ukraine’s government, bringing its total budgetary support since Russia’s February invasion to $8.5bn (£7bn), the US Agency for International Development has announced. The funding, coordinated with the US Treasury Department through the World Bank, will go to Ukraine’s government in tranches, beginning with a $3bn (£2.5bn) disbursement in August, USAid, the Agency for International Development, said. Russia has suspended an arrangement that allowed US and Russian inspectors to visit each other’s nuclear weapons sites under the 2010 New Start treaty, in a fresh blow to arms control. Mutual inspections had been suspended as a health precaution since the start of the Covid pandemic, but a foreign ministry statement on Monday added another reason Russia is unwilling to restart them. It argued that US sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine stopped Russian inspectors travelling to the US. It is highly likely Russia is deploying anti-personnel mines to protect and deter freedom of movement along its defensive lines in Donetsk and Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. The ministry called the PFM-1 and PFM-1S mines – also known as “butterfly mines” – “deeply controversial and indiscriminate weapons” with the potential to inflict widespread casualties among both the military and the local civilian population. Two more ships, carrying corn and soybeans, departed Ukrainian ports, taking the total to 10 ships carrying Ukrainian grain exports since the UN deal to unblock Ukraine’s grain exports was struck, Reuters reported. Future ships exporting Ukraine grain through the Black Sea will now be protected by a 10 nautical mile buffer zone, according to long-awaited procedures agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations. The first grain carrying ship to depart Ukrainian ports after the UN-brokered deal is looking for another port to unload its cargo after the initial Lebanese buyer refused delivery due to its five-month delay, Reuters reported. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom has called for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to be made a military-free zone, warning of the risk of a Chornobyl-style nuclear disaster after shelling of the site caused a reactor to shut down on Saturday. Russia and Ukraine continue to trade accusations over is responsible for the shelling, with the UN calling for international inspectors to be given access. According to reports from the head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region, the nuclear power station is currently operating normally. The Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree on Monday providing for a referendum on joining Russia, in the latest sign that Moscow is moving ahead with its plans to annex seized Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has ruled out any peace talks with Russia if the country proceeds with referendums in the occupied areas. The Kremlin said on Monday there was no basis for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents at the moment. Negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv have been stalled for months, with each side blaming the other for a lack of progress, Reuters reports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/04/london-stock-exchange-suspends-trading-in-more-russian-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T09:40:07Z","webTitle":"London Stock Exchange suspends trading in more Russian firms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/london-stock-exchange-suspends-trading-in-more-russian-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/04/london-stock-exchange-suspends-trading-in-more-russian-firms","fields":{"headline":"London Stock Exchange suspends trading in more Russian firms","bodyText":"The London Stock Exchange has suspended trading in more Russian companies, while an independent director resigned from the board of Evraz, the steel and mining group in which Roman Abramovich holds a 29% stake. The LSE suspended trading in the remaining eight companies with strong links to Russia that were not included on a list of 27 companies suspended on Thursday. The companies trade financial instruments in London, including global depositary receipts and American depositary receipts, but not ordinary shares, which are traded in on other stock exchanges where they have their primary listings. Also on Friday, Evraz – which has its primary listing in London and is incorporated in the UK – announced that James Rutherford had resigned from the board immediately. Rutherford was a non-executive director at Evraz for only nine months and also holds directorships at the mining groups Centamin and Anglo Pacific. His resignation came a day after the Institute of Directors urged British nationals to quit Russian boards, saying it was “no longer tenable” for them to remain after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, adding that any directors of Belarusian firms should also quit. Evraz also counts the former Ford executive Stephen Odell and Sir Michael Peat, a former private secretary to Prince Charles and whose family name is the “p” in KPMG, on its board. Peat, who was paid $224,000 (£168,232) last year, is due to stand down at the end of March, having been a board member since 2011. Rutherford was paid $125,000 from his appointment last June until the end of last year. Odell was paid $138,000. Evraz, which last week announced a dividend worth $450m to Abramovich, has so far not been caught in the sanctions being levelled at companies with strong links to Russia. On Thursday, the London Stock Exchange suspended trading in 27 companies, including the energy and banking firms Gazprom and Sberbank. The LSE said it was taking the action “in light of market conditions, and in order to maintain orderly markets”. On Friday, the LSE added the state-owned Federal Grid, Russia’s largest transmission company, the telecoms provider Rostelecom, the residential property developer Etalon, the supermarket chain O’Key, the fertiliser company Acron, the food retail chain Magnit, the investment firm Sistema and the commercial seaport Novorossiysk to its list of companies barred from trading in London. However, Evraz is one of a number of companies linked to Russia that have so far not been barred because they have been assigned “UK nationality” by the LSE for trading purposes. Nevertheless, international pressure is taking an increasing toll on Russian businesses, while the invasion of Ukraine is also disrupting those with operations in the region. On Wednesday, Evraz and the precious metals mining group Polymetal dropped out of the FTSE 100 in its quarterly review after their market values plummeted. The market value of Evraz has fallen by more than 80% since Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2022/mar/04/jennifer-griffin-fox-news-fact-checking-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T07:00:31Z","webTitle":"The Fox News journalist fact-checking channel’s pundits on air over Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/04/jennifer-griffin-fox-news-fact-checking-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/mar/04/jennifer-griffin-fox-news-fact-checking-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"The Fox News journalist fact-checking channel’s pundits on air over Ukraine","bodyText":"As Russia prepared to invade Ukraine, some hosts at the rightwing Fox News channel were passionately defending Vladimir Putin. Once Russian troops were in Ukraine, those same personalities, such as Tucker Carlson, swiftly began to blame Joe Biden for the invasion. That will not have surprised regular viewers of Fox, but what has raised eyebrows is the way that the views of hosts such as Carlson, the crew at the morning show Fox &amp; Friends, and the opinions of multiple Fox News guests have been corrected often in real time, by one of Fox News’ own journalists. Time and again over the past few days Jennifer Griffin, Fox News’ national security correspondent, has taken to the airwaves to directly contradict the messages of her colleagues and their guests. One former US brigadier general was dismissed on air by Griffin as “not a student of history” after he agitated for American intervention in Ukraine. A former military adviser to Donald Trump was described as a Putin “apologist” after suggesting Russia should be allowed to get on with subsuming Ukraine. It has brought Griffin, a widely respected journalist who joined Fox News in 1996 and spent three years as a reporter in Moscow, to the fore in the US, as non-Fox News viewers have been buoyed by her blunt dismissals. Last week Griffin had already corrected Fox &amp; Friends’ Steve Doocy and lectured the Fox News host Harris Faulkner about how Joe Biden stationing troops at Ukraine’s border would have given Putin “a pretext to go into Ukraine”, but the veteran journalist stepped it up in recent days as she apparently lost patience with the opinions of some of the Fox News punditocracy. Griffin’s first target was Don Bolduc, a retired army brigadier general who is running, for the second time, for the US Senate in New Hampshire. Bolduc, a vocal Trump supporter who has advanced the conspiracy theory that the former president won the 2020 election, appeared on Fox News on Saturday where he pushed for greater US military intervention in Ukraine. Enter Griffin. “I have to respond to something your previous guest, Brigadier General Bolduc, said, because he really was way off the mark in terms of talking about what the US could do on the ground,” she said. “Putin has nuclear weapons. That is why the US military and Nato do not have troops on the ground inside Ukraine.” Griffin continued: “Clearly, Brigadier General Bolduc is not a student of history – he’s a politician, he ran for Senate in New Hampshire and failed. He’s not a military strategist, and to suggest that the US would put indirect fire or special operations or CIA on the ground to give Putin any sort of excuse to broaden this conflict is extremely dangerous talk at a time like this.” The Bolduc burn came after Griffin had already stymied Sean Hannity’s efforts, two days before Russia’s invasion, to blame the crisis on Biden. “Sean, how we got to this point is a long story and it predates the Biden administration,” she said. “It goes back and includes mistakes made by every US president since the Soviet Union fell apart.” As Griffin’s reputation grew, she was asked about her fact-checking efforts on the Fox News show Media Buzz on Sunday. Howard Kurtz, the show’s host, referenced a Washington Post article headlined: “Jennifer Griffin keeps fact-checking her Fox News colleagues on Ukraine.” Kurtz said: “Now, I read that as you don’t want to get drawn into opinion debates. How do you see your role during this war?” Griffin, who joined Fox News in 1996, said: “I cover the news.” She added: “I’m here to fact-check facts because I report on facts. And my job is to try and figure out the truth as best as I know it. I share those facts internally so that our network can be more accurate. That’s what I’ve always done.” Hours after the Media Buzz appearance, Griffin was forced to return to the fact-checking, during an appearance on Trey Gowdy’s Fox News show. Gowdy, a former Republican congressman, had just been chatting with his guest, the former Trump military adviser Doug Macgregor, and Griffin had some thoughts. “I feel like I need to correct some of the things that Col Douglas Macgregor said, and I’m not sure that 10 minutes is enough time to do so, because there were so many distortions,” Griffin began. Macgregor, a former army colonel, had confidently told Gowdy that Putin had no intention of invading any other countries, and said the Russian president was merely “carrying through on something that he has been warning us about at least for the last 15 years”. Macgregor claimed that Russians and Ukrainians were “indistinguishable” from one another, and when asked whether Russia should be allowed to take as much of Ukraine as he likes, Macgregor said: “Yes, absolutely.” Griffin came on air and swiftly accused Macgregor of sounding like a Putin “apologist”: because “there were so many distortions in what he just said”. “I don’t think anyone I’ve spoken to at the Pentagon or elsewhere in western intelligence believes they know how far Putin wants to go,” she said. Griffin said that Macgregor, when an adviser to the Trump administration, had supported pulling US troops out of Germany. “That kind of projection of withdrawal and weakness is what made Putin think that he could actually move into a sovereign country like Ukraine,” she said. With no end to the Russian invasion in sight, it seems like Griffin will continue to have her work cut out for her. That was illustrated on Tuesday night when Carlson, Fox News’ most-watched host, wheeled Macgregor back on to the network and appeared to take a veiled swipe at Griffin. Carlson, whose recent defense of Putin was played on Russia 1 as Putin made his case to the Russian public for war, gave Macgregor the red carpet treatment, lavishing praise on the recently humbled former military man. “Unlike so many of the TV generals you see all day long, Macgregor is not angling for a board seat at Raytheon,” the Daily Beast quoted Carlson as saying. “Unlike many of the so-called reporters you see on television, he is not acting secretly as a flack for Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon. No, Doug Macgregor is an honest man.” After a brief interview with Macgregor, where the under-fire guest criticized Nato and questioned the amount of money being spent on supporting Ukraine, Carlson turned to the camera. “Doug Macgregor. A man you can believe,” Carlson said, defying Griffin’s earlier analysis that suggested quite the opposite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/09/offsite-power-supply-to-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-destroyed","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-09T18:08:43Z","webTitle":"Offsite power supply to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant destroyed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/09/offsite-power-supply-to-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-destroyed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/09/offsite-power-supply-to-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-destroyed","fields":{"headline":"Offsite power supply to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant destroyed","bodyText":"A vital offsite electricity supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been destroyed by shelling and there is little likelihood a reliable supply will be re-established, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog chief has said. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said shelling had destroyed the switchyard of a nearby thermal power plant. The plant has supplied power to the nuclear facility each time its normal supply lines had been cut over the past three weeks. The thermal plant was also supplying the surrounding area, which was plunged into darkness. Local Ukrainian officials said work was under way to restore the connection, which has been cut multiple times this week. Grossi, who said he had been informed of the situation by IAEA representatives at the plant, called for an “immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area”. “This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious,” he said, without apportioning blame for the shelling. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for shelling near Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine and within the perimeter of Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which has six reactors. The thermal supply has been cut and restored multiple times this week and Enerhodar, the nearby town, has suffered several complete blackouts. When the thermal supply has been cut the plant has relied on its only remaining operating reactor for the power needed for cooling and other safety functions. This method is designed to provide power only for a few hours at a time. Diesel generators are used as a last resort. The constant destruction of thermal power supply has led Ukraine to consider shutting down the remaining operating reactor, said Grossi. Ukraine “no longer [has] confidence in the restoration of offsite power”, he said. Grossi said that if Ukraine decided not to restore the offsite supply the entire power plant would be reliant on emergency diesel generators to ensure supplies for the nuclear safety and security functions. “As a consequence, the operator would not be able to restart the reactors unless offsite power was reliably re-established,” he said. Enerhodar’s mayor in exile, Dmytro Orlov, said on Friday that work was under way to fix the switchyard and restore the supply from the thermal plant to the town, most of which was still suffering a blackout. The development came as diplomats from Canada and Poland prepare to submit a draft resolution to be voted on by the IAEA’s board of governors, according to Reuters. The IAEA acts the international nuclear watchdog under the United Nations. The draft text, seen by Reuters, implores Russia to leave the power plant and for control over the plant to be given to the competent authorities within Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders. The text is expected to be passed, according to diplomats cited by Reuters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-160-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T10:16:58Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 160 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-160-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-160-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 160 of the invasion","bodyText":"The US announced on Monday a new tranche of weapons for Ukraine’s forces fighting Russia, including ammunition for increasingly important rocket launchers and artillery guns. The $550m package will “include more ammunition for the high mobility advanced rocket systems otherwise known as Himars, as well as ammunition” for artillery, national security council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has said that Russia had destroyed six US-made Himars missile systems since the beginning of the latest Russian invasion of Ukraine. Three people have reportedly been killed by Russian shelling while evacuating in a minibus near Kherson, Ukraine’s military is reporting. Ukraine’s Operational Command ‘South’ reported that three people died from the attack on the bus near Dovhove. Turkey’s representative at the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul has said that the first ship carrying Ukrainian grain to world markets was expected to anchor at Istanbul on Tuesday night. At a briefing held at the JCC, general Özcan Altunbulak said the course of the ship was going as planned. Another official said “The plan is for a ship to leave every day. If nothing goes wrong, exports will be made via one ship a day for a while.” Ukraine’s state security service says it is investigating 752 cases of treason and collaboration. According to the agency, the greatest amount of cases have been documented in the regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. The United Nations’ secretary general, António Guterres, has warned that a misunderstanding could spark nuclear destruction, as the US, Britain and France urged Russia to stop “its dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behaviour”. Sabina Higgins, the wife of Ireland’s president, Michael D Higgins, has triggered a political row in Ireland by urging Russia and Ukraine to call a ceasefire and enter negotiations. Critics said the intervention amounted to Kremlin propaganda because it appeared to equate Moscow’s aggression with Kyiv’s fight for survival. The US has accused Russia of using Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant as a “nuclear shield”. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Washington was “deeply concerned” that Moscow was now using the plant as a military base and firing on Ukrainian forces from around it and called Russia’s actions around the plant “the height of irresponsibility”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/16/russia-ukraine-war-live-150-children-abducted-from-luhansk-and-taken-to-russia-says-ukraine","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-16T17:55:18Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine offensive moving towards Mariupol, minister says – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/16/russia-ukraine-war-live-150-children-abducted-from-luhansk-and-taken-to-russia-says-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/16/russia-ukraine-war-live-150-children-abducted-from-luhansk-and-taken-to-russia-says-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine offensive moving towards Mariupol, minister says – as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s main news: The centre of the fighting in Ukraine has switched to the road to Mariupol where the Ukrainian offensive is slowly pushing back Russian forces, with British Challenger tanks ready to join battle, a minister in Kyiv has said. Vladimir Putin confirmed that Russia has deployed its first tranche of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. He said nuclear weapons would only be used in the event of a threat to the existence of the Russian state. Speaking at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum on Friday, the Russian president also said there was a “serious danger” that the Nato military alliance could be pulled further into the Ukraine war. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying Russia was ready for further talks on arms control. A delegation of African leaders began a peace mission in Kyiv on Friday, undeterred by what Ukraine said was a barrage of Russian missiles intended to greet them in the Ukrainian capital. Volodymyr Zelenskiy reportedly said after meeting African leaders that peace talks with Russia would be possible only after Moscow withdraws its forces from occupied Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian air force said on Friday it destroyed six Kinzhals, six Kalibr cruise missiles and two reconnaissance drones, with the chief of the Kyiv military administration stating they were all intercepted over the Kyiv region. Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko said there was no damage in the capital and reported an explosion from air defence in the central Podil district. It is unclear whether water from the huge reservoir of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine that burst last week can still be pumped to the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant for cooling, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Friday. While the reservoir was a main source of water for cooling the six reactors and spent fuel ponds at Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, the plant can fall back on other sources including a large cooling pond which the International Atomic Energy Agency says has enough water to last for months. The bursting of the dam has, however, further complicated an already difficult situation in terms of ensuring Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia operates safely, Reuters quotes the IAEA as saying. Shelling has repeatedly downed external power lines that are also vital to ensuring the cooling necessary to prevent a nuclear meltdown. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday questioned why a visiting delegation of African leaders planned to travel to Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin after a Russian missile strike overshadowed their visit to Kyiv. “This is their decision, how logical it is, I don’t really understand,” he was quoted by Reuters as telling reporters at a joint news conference with the African leaders. Zelenskiy also said that he wanted to hold a Ukraine-Africa summit, and for Kyiv to step up its relations with the continent. Kyiv has been courting the Global South and trying to challenge Russia’s influence in the region. Russia plans to hold its second Russia-Africa summit this summer. The centre of the fighting in Ukraine has switched to the road to Mariupol where the Ukrainian offensive is slowly pushing back Russian forces, with British Challenger tanks ready to join battle, a minister in Kyiv has said. Hanna Maliar, a deputy defence minister, said the most active fighting was no longer around Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk region, but in the south and specifically in the direction of the two coastal cities of Berdiansk and Mariupol. “If the first week the epicentre was the east, now we see that the fighting is moving to the south and now we see the most active areas are Berdiansk and Mariupol,” Maliar said. “In the east, the enemy has turned on all the forces to stop our offensive. And they are massing forces there to stop us. In the south they are not very successful.” The movement towards Mariupol, infamous for the devastation visited upon it in the first months of the full-scale invasion, is still incremental, with the front said to have been pushed back by about a kilometre. You can read the full story by my colleague Daniel Boffey here: African countries are prepared to participate further in a peace pact in Ukraine, South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa said after a meeting between African leaders and Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv, during which he called for a free flow of grain (via Reuters). On Friday, a delegation to Ukraine of leaders and senior officials from Africa sought ways to end the war with Russia and ensure continued food and fertiliser deliveries to their continent. There are no indications that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons and the US sees no reason to adjust its own nuclear posture, US secretary of state Antony Blinken was quoted by Reuters as telling reporters on Friday. His comments came after Vladimir Putin said Russia could “theoretically” use nuclear weapons if there was a threat to its territorial integrity or existence, but that it did not need to (See post at 15:51). Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday he had invited African leaders to take part in a global peace summit and rejected the idea of peace talks with Moscow, which he said would simply freeze the war in Ukraine. Speaking at a news conference with visiting African leaders, Ukraine’s president said his country needed a real peace with the withdrawal of Russian troops from occupied territory, Reuters reports. “To allow any negotiations with Russia now while the occupier is on our land is to freeze the war, to freeze everything: pain and suffering,” Zelenskiy said. “We need real peace, and therefore, a real withdrawal of Russian troops from our entire independent land.” A plane carrying South African president Cyril Ramaphosa’s security detail and media representatives, that has been grounded in Poland since Thursday, will remain at Warsaw airport until Sunday, an airport spokesman told the BBC (See post at 15:09). Warsaw Chopin Airport spokesman Piotr Rudzki told the BBC that some of the people onboard had now got off and gone to a hotel. The US on Friday announced a further $205m (£163m) in humanitarian aid to Ukraine to help the country with shortages of food, drinking water and other needs as its fights against Russia’s invasion. The aid, which will be distributed via partner NGOs in the region, was also aimed at helping victims of the war maintain contact with family members who have been separated, the US secretary of state said in a statement. The US has provided more than $2bn (£1.56bn) in humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the war started last February, the statement added. Antony Blinken said: We continue to call for an immediate end to Russia’s war of aggression and for Russia to facilitate unhindered access to providers of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and safe passage for those who seek to move to safer areas. Vladimir Putin has confirmed that Russia has delivered parts of its first tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus. Speaking at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum on Friday, the Russian president said: We were discussing it with president Lukashenko… we were discussing then parts of these weapons should be moved to Belarus and this has been done already. They have been moved there until the end of summer, and (by the) end of the year all this will have been completed. But this is a deterrence measure. Putin refused to be drawn further on the matter, asking the session host: “Do you want me to frighten the whole world? No, I don’t want it.” The comments came as Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Russia was ready for further talks on arms control, the Interfax news agency reported, without elaborating further. Russian and Belarusian military officials signed a pact in May that provides for Moscow to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. The plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on foreign soil is Russia’s first since 1991. The Kremlin has defended the decision saying that it is being provoked by western powers supporting Ukraine. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, is expected to visit Moscow next week, the Interfax news agency reported on Friday, citing the head of Russia’s state nuclear company, Rosatom. Grossi visited the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Thursday to assess its condition. It followed last week’s breach in the Kakhovka dam downstream on the Dnipro River. He said the situation at the power plant in Ukraine is “serious” and that ensuring water for cooling was a priority of his visit, adding that the station could operate safely for “some time”. Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of shelling near the plant, endangering its safe operation. The station’s six reactors are now in shutdown. You can read more about the state of the nuclear power station and Grossi’s comments here: Speaking at Russia’s flagship St Petersburg International Economic Forum, Vladimir Putin said on Friday there was a “serious danger” that the Nato military alliance could be pulled further into the Ukraine war. A delegation of African leaders began a peace mission in Kyiv on Friday, undeterred by what Ukraine said was a barrage of Russian missiles intended to greet them in the Ukrainian capital. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had repelled numerous attempted counterattacks by the Ukrainian army at different frontline locations in the last 24 hours, inflicting heavy losses on Kyiv’s forces. The Ukrainian air force said on Friday it destroyed six Kinzhals, six Kalibr cruise missiles and two reconnaissance drones. All were intercepted over the Kyiv region, the chief of the Kyiv military administration Sergiy Popko said. Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko said there was no damage in the capital and reported an explosion from air defence in the central Podil district. Russian troops who have destroyed German-made Leopard tanks and US-supplied armoured vehicles being used by Ukraine will receive bonus payments, the defence ministry was reported as saying. Vladimir Putin has said Ukraine’s counteroffensive would fail as Kyiv’s troops sought to advance in several directions, including the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia. “I think that Ukraine’s armed forces stand no chance here, as well as in other directions – I have no doubt about that,” the Russian president told an annual economic forum in St Petersburg on Friday. Putin went on to claim Ukraine’s armed forces were suffering “heavy losses”, saying “they are using the so-called strategic reserves”. These claims could not be immediately independently verified. Vladimir Putin said on Friday there was a “serious danger” that the Nato military alliance could be pulled further into the Ukraine war. The Russian president also said that nuclear weapons would only possibly be used in case of a threat to the existence of the “Russian state”, adding “we have more such weapons than the western countries”. Speaking at Russia’s flagship St Petersburg International Economic Forum, he said Russia’s military could destroy parts of central Kyiv but had chosen not to for various reasons, which he did not specify. Nato has launched a new centre for protecting undersea pipelines and cables following the still-unsolved attack on the Nord Stream pipelines, AP reports. “The threat is developing,” Lt Gen Hans-Werner Wiermann, who heads a special unit focused on the challenge, said after Nato defence ministers gave the greenlight for the new centre, located in Northwood, north-west London. He told reporters at Nato headquarters in Brussels on Friday: Russian ships have actively mapped our critical undersea infrastructure. There are heightened concerns that Russia may target undersea cables and other critical infrastructure in an effort to disrupt Western life. In September 2022, several unexplained underwater explosions ruptured the Nord Stream 1 and newly-built Nord Stream 2 pipelines that link Russia and Germany across the Baltic Sea. The blasts occurred in the economic zones of Sweden and Denmark and both countries say the explosions were deliberate – though they have yet to single out who was responsible. Nato has since boosted its presence in the Baltic and North seas, with dozens of ships, supported by maritime patrol aircraft and undersea equipment such as drones. The South African delegation appears to have disembarked from the plane that landed in Warsaw on Thursday afternoon, after lengthy delays. Journalist Pieter Du Toit, from South African media outlet News24, tweeted this: Among the group held up was Maj. Gen. Wally Rhoode, the head of Cyril Ramaphosa’s personal protection unit, who claimed the delegation faced hostile treatment from Polish authorities, including one of their female colleagues who was allegedly strip searched. Rhoode told journalists from the steps of the plane that Polish officials were being deliberately obstructive and had tried to “confiscate” firearms from them – even though the arms were being transported in secure cases in the plane’s cargo hold, AP reports. According to the Poland border guard agency, Ramaphosa’s security detail did not have permission for the weapons they were carrying, which resulted in a standoff. The Polish authorities have denied they were being racist. There are two diplomatic rows brewing over the African peace visit to Ukraine today. As reported earlier, some of South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa’s entourage have been stuck in Poland. [See 12.23 BST] Spokesperson Vincent Magwenya has said “The treatment received by PPS members and journalists in Poland, on board the South African charter flight is very unfortunate and deeply regrettable. Our officials remain engaged with their Polish counterparts in trying to resolve the situation.” However, Magwenya has himself drawn ire for a tweet this morning, following the air alert in Kyiv. He said: Strangely, we didn’t hear the sirens or explosions. #AfricanPeaceMission program is proceeding as planned. A picture released by Ukrainian authorities purports to show damage from this mornings attack. US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said he urged Turkey to allow Sweden’s entry into Nato during an introductory meeting on Friday with his new Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan during a gathering of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. “My purpose in meeting him today was an introductory meeting, just to congratulate him on being installed as minister of defence. Of course, [I] seize every opportunity to encourage him to move forward and approve the accession of Sweden,” Reuters reports Austin told a press conference at Nato headquarters. “But it’s a very short meeting, and I don’t have anything to report out from that.” Canada will bolster the Nato force in Latvia with the deployment of 15 Leopard 2A4M tanks, their supporting personnel and equipment, the defence minister said on Friday, Reuters reports. The army tank squadron will be fully deployed by the autumn, defence minister Anita Anand said, speaking to reporters from Brussels. Canada is in the process of increasing its presence in Latvia, where it has 800 members of its armed forces in its largest foreign military deployment. The Canada-led Nato battle group in Latvia is made up from contributions from 11 nations. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin is still speaking in St Petersburg at the economic forum, by the way. He has mostly been going into specific detail about the performance and regulation of the Russian economy. Putin has told the gathering that Western sanctions on Russia had failed to isolate it and instead led to an “expansion” in its trade with emerging markets. My colleague Emma Graham-Harrison notes photographs which seems to show that the artwork house of Polina Rayko has been significantly damaged by the flooding in Kherson. Volodymyr Litvinov, head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson, reports on Telegram that one person has been injured in a village in the area. He stated: The army of the Russian Federation struck a residential building, as a result of which the building and outbuildings were damaged. One person was injured. Nato defence ministers meeting in Brussels have failed to reach agreement over the alliance’s first defence plans since the end of the cold war, two officials told Reuters on Friday (See post at 11:43). “While regional plans were not formally endorsed today, we anticipate these plans will be part of a series of deliverables for the Vilnius summit in July,” a senior US official said. Speaking at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, Vladimir Putin has said that Russia’s public finances were generally balanced and that it had had to increase defence spending to reinforce its security. The Russian president said: Naturally, additional funds were needed to strengthen defence and security, to purchase weapons. We were forced to do this to protect our country’s sovereignty. “I should say that on the whole this justifies itself from an economic point of view,” he added. Vladimir Putin has said Russia’s economy may grow by up to 2% this year as it bounces back from last year’s contraction in the face of sweeping western sanctions. Putin’s forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) growth, delivered at Russia’s flagship economic forum in St Petersburg, is similar to those of other Russian authorities, Reuters reports. The International Monetary Fund in April forecast Russian GDP growth at 0.7%, up from 0.3% in a previous estimate, but lowered its 2024 forecast to 1.3% from 2.1%. Vladimir Putin has started speaking at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. The forum, being held between 14 and 17 June, has for decades been Russia’s vehicle for touting its development and seeking investors. The Russian president’s appearances at the forum have been highly visible and he often used the occasion to hold roundtable discussions with international news executives. The spectre of the Russia-Ukraine war looms large over the forum this year, with many notable absentees, including no representation from Europe or the US. Yury Ushakov, a top Kremlin foreign policy aide, said on Friday that Russia was unlikely to quit the Black Sea grain deal before it comes up for renewal on 17 July, state media reported. Russian officials have said, however, they see no grounds to extend it beyond that, Reuters reports. Vladimir Putin said this week that Moscow was considering withdrawing from the deal – which enables Ukraine to ship grain from its Black Sea ports – because it had been “cheated” by the west over promises to remove barriers to Russia’s own grain and fertiliser exports. Two children and an elderly woman have been injured in the Kyiv region after a Russian missile attack, with more than 30 houses being damaged, the Kyiv Post cited the regional police as saying (See post at 10:58). The South African president’s security team has been stuck on a plane in Poland for several hours, the BBC has reported. Radio Zet, a Polish radio station, reportedly claimed that the SAA plane that has been stuck on the tarmac at an airport in Warsaw will not be able to disembark. “It turns out that some of the delegation do not have the documents to leave the airport. Secondly, unofficially, the president’s additional bodyguards have weapons. They do not have the proper permits for them,” Radio Zet was quoted as saying. Presidential spokesperson Vincent Magwenya reassured people that South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa arrived safely in Kyiv by train, despite the delays experienced by some of his security team. He said: I would like to assure all South Africans that there has been no compromise whatsoever to the president’s safety as a result of the impasse that involved the charter flight with the presidential protection services team and the media. We acknowledge the regrettable nature of that incident. Our officials are engaging with their Polish counterparts to resolve the impasse. Vladimir Putin hailed Russia’s ties with the United Arab Emirates on Friday as he met the leader of the oil-rich nation, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in St Petersburg (See post at 11:12) “The Emirates are a very good partner,” Putin said in televised comments at the start of the meeting, which took place on the sidelines of an economic summit in Russia’s second city. Putin thanked Sheikh Mohammed for the role the UAE has played in prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine and Russia and the US, AFP reports. Sheikh Mohammed said he was in favour of “de-escalation” and a “political solution” to the Ukraine war during the talks, in which the pair discussed their countries’ “strategic partnership”, according to the UAE official news agency WAM. Russia and UAE have closely cooperated as members of the OPEC+ oil alliance and Dubai is one of the rare world capitals to have maintained direct flights to Moscow following the start of the Ukraine war in February 2022. South Africa’s presidency has just posted some videos from Kyiv’s St Michael’s Square on Twitter. They were filmed receiving a briefing by representatives of Ukraine’s ministry of defence. African leaders have began a peace mission, hoping to mediate between Ukraine and Russia (See post at 07:56). African leaders, including South African president Cyril Ramaphosa and Senegalese president Macky Sall, began their trip by visiting the town of Bucha, outside Kyiv. Ukraine says Russian occupiers carried out executions, rapes and torture in Bucha, and international investigators are collecting evidence of war crimes. Russia denies the allegations. As Ukraine pushes on with its counteroffensive, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and other senior officials from Nato member countries are continuing into a second day of ministerial meetings in Brussels. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s general secretary, left open the prospect that his term may be extended as senior officials from alliance member countries openly endorsed the idea on Thursday. Ben Wallace, Britain’s defence secretary, was previously tipped as a contender owing to his role in supporting Ukraine after Russia’s invasion. Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday its forces had repelled numerous attempted counterattacks by the Ukrainian army at different frontline locations in the last 24 hours, inflicting heavy losses on Kyiv’s forces. Ukraine says its forces have recaptured at least seven villages and 100 square km in the early stages of a counteroffensive it hopes will gather greater momentum as it commits more soldiers, Reuters reports. In its daily update on fighting, Russia’s defence ministry said it had inflicted significant losses on Ukrainian troops during what it described as unsuccessful Ukrainian counteroffensive operations in the South Donetsk and Donetsk directions. It said Russia had used ground troops, air strikes and artillery fire to repel Ukrainian troops, and that in the last 24 hours at various locations had killed about 500 Ukrainian soldiers and destroyed five tanks. Many armoured vehicles and other items of Ukrainian military hardware had also been destroyed, it added. These claims could not be immediately independently verified. There are bridges being built to strengthen the partnership between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Russia, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE’s president, told Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a forum in St. Petersburg on Friday. “I am pleased to be here today with you, your excellency, and we wish to build on this relationship and we put our trust in you to do so,” Sheikh Mohammed was quoted by Reuters as saying. When Putin makes his annual keynote speech at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, he will reportedly be joined on stage only by the president of Algeria, as Western companies have almost universally shunned the self-styled “Russian Davos”. Kyiv’s mayor reported there was no damage to Ukraine’s capital after a missile attack by Russia on Friday morning. According to information provided by the Ukrainian air force, the city’s defences shot down six Kinzhal ballistic missiles, six Kalibr cruise missiles and two reconnaissance drones. Explosions from the action of air defences were reported in Ukraine’s capital as the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and other African leaders were in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as part of a peace initiative. The leaders are due to head to Moscow and meet Vladimir Putin on Saturday. Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, said “The Russian missile attack took place just when the leaders of African countries arrived in the capital. Putin wants to demonstrate that he is willing to disregard the safety of foreign leaders, he actually doesn’t care because he feels complete impunity.” Kherson’s regional authority has said that 1,649 houses in 17 settlements on the right bank of the Dnipro remain flooded after the collapse of the Kakhovka dam. They also claim that 17 settlements remain flooded on the opposite bank, which is occupied by Russian forces. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi has posted a video which claims to show Ukrainian forces taking out Russian positions near the town of Bakhmut. In a short message on Telegram, the commander of the Ukrainian ground forces said “The enemy is steadily losing equipment near Bakhmut, our soldiers are knocking the Russians out of their positions.” Russian troops who have destroyed German-made Leopard tanks and US-supplied armoured vehicles being used by Ukraine will receive bonus payments, the defence ministry said on Friday. The ministry said this was part of a wider reward scheme under which more than 10,000 Russian servicemen had received individual bonuses since the start of the war nearly 16 months ago. 150 children have been illegally taken from the Luhansk region to Russia, according to Ukraine’s National Resistance Centre. It said the children were taken from the occupied region’s Starobilsk district on 8 June to two centres in the Prikuban district of Russia’s Karachay-Cherkess republic. Ukraine has regained control of more than 100 sq km (38 sq miles) of territory in its counteroffensive, senior Ukrainian military commander Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov has claimed. The deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said there was a “gradual but steady advance” but that Russian forces were putting up “powerful resistance” on the southern front. Suspilne reports that Kyiv sustained no damage or injuries in this morning’s Russian missile attack. On its official Telegram channel it wrote: Mayor Klitschko clarified that the explosions in the Podilsky district of Kyiv were heard due to the work of the air defence forces in the region. There is no damage in Kyiv after the missile attack. Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has commented on Telegram about this morning’s attack on Kyiv by Russia. The Russian missile attack took place just when the leaders of African countries arrived in the capital. Putin wants to demonstrate that he is willing to disregard the safety of foreign leaders, he actually doesn’t care because he feels complete impunity. And anyone can be in the place of the leaders of African countries. We remember that rockets flew also when US president Joe Biden and UN secretary general António Guterres arrived in Ukraine. Yermak continued: The world must understand that consolidation and the toughest possible position towards Russia are now necessary. It is necessary to show strength to the state that undermines global security and acts with terrorist methods. We must unite around the peace formula of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. There is no alternative to it. And we must discuss further steps at the Global Peace Summit. Only strong diplomacy and a strong position can put an end to Russian terrorism. Because it concerns everyone, every state that wants to exist and preserve the world order. Daniel Boffey reports from Kyiv for the Guardian: The all clear has sounded in Kyiv. According to information just provided by the Ukrainian air force, the city’s defences shot down six Kinzhal ballistic missiles, six Kalibr cruise missiles and two reconnaissance drones. And life goes on as normal on the streets of the Ukrainian capital. The all clear has sounded in Kyiv. We are getting some pictures over the news wires of leaders from the African peace delegation visiting the site of mass graves discovered in Bucha, outside of Kyiv, which was temporarily occupied by Russian troops as part of their failed bid to seize Ukraine’s capital in the earliest days of the war. Daniel Boffey is in Kyiv for the Guardian: Two rockets from Kyiv’s anti missile defence systems were launched moments ago to intercept Russian missiles coming from the south-east of the city. They streaked over the Guardian’s accommodation in Ukraine’s capital and explosions were heard shortly afterwards. Further attempted strikes on Kyiv are expected in the coming hour. Ballistic missiles are said to have been launched and incoming from the north of the city. Kyiv’s mayor has reported an explosion in the Podilskyi district of the capital. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that its correspondents have heard explosions in Kyiv. The local authority has said that air defence is in operation. The attack comes shortly after South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa arrived in the capital as part of a peace delegation which is also expected to visit Moscow. An air alert is in place across much of Ukraine with reports of Kalibr cruise missiles being fired from the Black Sea. More details soon … The Kyiv city administration says that air defence is “working on the approaches to Kyiv in the region”, reports Suspilne. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, citing Ukraine’s air force command, reports that “several Kalibr-type missiles were headed north” from the Black Sea. Ukrainian diplomat Olexander Scherba points out on Twitter that the air alert in Kyiv comes as Ukraine is welcoming a peace delegation from Africa. An air alert has been declared in Kyiv and other regions of Ukraine. Nato allies may be ready to remove some hurdles on Ukraine’s path to the military alliance, German defence minister Boris Pistorius said on Friday. “There are increasing signs that everyone will be able to agree on this,” he told reporters in Brussels when asked about reports that the US is open to permitting Kyiv to forgo a formal candidacy process required of some other nations in the past. “I would be open for this,” Reuters reports he said. Nato has ruled out Ukraine joining while it is actively at war. Kherson’s regional authority has said that 1,649 houses in 17 settlements on the right bank of the Dnipro remain flooded after the collapse of the Kakhovka dam. They also claim that 17 settlements remain flooded on the opposite bank, which is occupied by Russian forces. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, offers this news update on Telegram of events overnight. It reports: At night, air defence forces destroyed two “Shahed” drones over the Mykolaiv region, the air force reported. Also at night, the Russian army fired artillery at residential buildings in Novoberyslav in the Kherson region: a couple died, reported the regional . In the last 24 hours, due to Russian shelling in Kherson oblast, two people were killed, two were injured, ten were injured in Donetsk oblast, and a resident of Orikhov was injured in Zaporizhzhia. The claims have not been independently verified. The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, arrived in Ukraine on Friday as part of an African peace mission, the South African presidency said on Twitter. Ramaphosa is expected to meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Friday and then travel to Russia for talks with Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg on Saturday. The South African presidency posted footage of Ramaphosa arriving after travelling via Poland. Along with the Senegal president, Macky Sall, Ramaphosa is heading a delegation including leaders from Zambia and the Comoros, and Egypt’s prime minister. The peace mission could propose a series of “confidence building measures” during initial efforts at mediation, according to a draft framework document seen by Reuters. The document states that the objective of the mission is “to promote the importance of peace and to encourage the parties to agree to a diplomacy-led process of negotiations”. Those measures could include a Russian troop pull-back, removal of tactical nuclear weapons from Belarus, suspension of implementation of an international criminal court arrest warrant targeting Putin, and sanctions relief, it indicated. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi has posted a video which claims to show Ukrainian forces taking out Russian positions near the town of Bakhmut, an area which was fiercely contested for months. In a short message on Telegram, the commander of the Ukrainian ground forces said: The enemy is steadily losing equipment near Bakhmut, our soldiers are knocking the Russians out of their positions. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian troops who have destroyed German-made Leopard tanks and US-supplied armoured vehicles being used by Ukraine will receive bonus payments, the defence ministry said on Friday. The ministry said this was part of a wider reward scheme under which more than 10,000 Russian service personnel had received individual bonuses since the start of the war nearly 16 months ago. On the basis of reports from Russian field commanders, “payments are currently being made to servicemen of the Russian Federation armed forces who in the course of military operations destroyed Leopard tanks, as well as armoured fighting vehicles made in the US and other Nato countries”, Reuters reports the ministry said. The ministry said that up to 31 May, a total of 10,257 service personnel had been rewarded for destroying 16,001 items of Ukrainian and western military equipment. The claims have not been independently verified. An enemy armoured vehicle was worth 50,000 roubles (£465/$596) and a tank 100,000 roubles (£930/$1192), it said. Ukraine plans to send “several dozen” combat pilots for training to fly US-manufactured F-16 fighter jets, the Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat has said, as western allies prepared the necessary training programmes. “Everything is being done to get it started as early as possible,” Reuters reports that Ihnat told Ukrainian national television, adding that the pilots picked for training would have combat experience. “It’s not training, it’s retraining,” Ihnat said. Dutch defence minister Kajsa Ollongren told Reuters this week that training Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s could begin as soon as this summer. She said the aim would be to have the training programme fully operational within six months. Denmark, where there are flight simulators, is a possible location to host the programme. Ukraine’s attempt to retake any territory currently occupied by Russia is hampered by the fact that Ukraine does not have air superiority. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

The senior Russian general killed in a Ukrainian missile strike in the Zaporizhzhia region on Tuesday was possibly acting commander of Russia’s 35th combined arms army (CAA) at the time of his death, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. The ministry said in its latest intelligence briefing that Gen-Maj Sergei Goryachev, the CAA’s chief of staff, was “almost certainly” killed in a strike on a command post in southern Ukraine. A Russian-installed official in Ukraine, Vladimir Rogov, confirmed the death on Tuesday, offering his condolences. The UK defence ministry said in its briefing, posted on Twitter, that Goryachev was the first Russian general confirmed killed in Ukraine this year. With 35 CAA’s nominated commander, General-Lieutenant Alexandr Sanchik, reported to be filling a gap in a higher HQ, there is a realistic possibility that Goryachev was the acting army commander at the time of his death. The ministry said Goryachev’s death “continues a war record which has been both difficult and controversial for 35th CAA”. In March 2022 elements of the army were present during the massacre of civilians in Bucha, and in June 2022 the force was largely wiped out near Izium. African leaders could propose a series of “confidence-building measures” during their initial efforts to mediate in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, according to a draft framework document seen by Reuters. The Senegalese and South African presidents are heading a delegation including the Egyptian prime minister and leaders from Zambia and the Comoro which is to travel to Kyiv on Friday and St Petersburg on Saturday, the news agency reported. They are expected to meet the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. The framework document, which has not been made public, states the objective of the mission is “to promote the importance of peace and to encourage the parties to agree to a diplomacy-led process of negotiations”. The conflict, as well as the sanctions placed on Russia by major trading partners of the [African] continent, have had an adverse effect on African economies and livelihoods. The document lists a number of measures that could be proposed by the African leaders as part of the first stage of their engagement with the warring parties. The measures could include a Russian troop pullback, removal of tactical nuclear weapons from Belarus, sanctions relief and suspension of the implementation of an international criminal court arrest warrant targeting Vladimir Putin. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, said Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, had given him a description of the African efforts. Ukraine says 150 children have been illegally taken from the occupied Luhansk region to Russia. The National Resistance Centre of Ukraine said the children were taken from the Luhansk’s Starobilsk district on 8 June to two centres in the Prikuban district of Russia’s Karachay-Cherkess republic. It said 19,393 children had so far been illegally transferred to Russia from Ukraine’s occupied territories, quoting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as saying last month. The international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in March for overseeing the abduction of Ukrainian children. In granting the request for warrants by the ICC prosecutor, a panel of judges agreed that there were “reasonable grounds” to believe Putin and his children’s rights commissioner, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, bore responsibility for the “unlawful deportation” of Ukrainian children. On Thursday, the National Resistance Centre said 750 children from Luhansk were expected to arrive this month at the two centres in Karachay-Cherkess. It also said “so-called medical examinations” of children were being conducted in Ukraine’s temporarily occupied territories. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. I’m Adam Fulton and we’ll start with a rundown of the latest developments. One-hundred-and-fifty children have been illegally taken from the Luhansk region to Russia, according to Ukraine’s National Resistance Centre. It said the children were taken from the occupied region’s Starobilsk district on 8 June to two centres in the Prikuban district of Russia’s Karachay-Cherkess republic. It added that 750 children from Luhansk were expected to arrive at the centres in June. In other news: Ukraine has regained control of more than 100 sq km (38 sq miles) of territory in its counteroffensive, senior Ukrainian military commander Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov has claimed. The deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said there was a “gradual but steady advance” but that Russian forces were putting up “powerful resistance” on the southern front. The UN nuclear watchdog chief has said the situation is “serious” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant but a number of measures have been taken to stabilise it. Rafael Grossi said after visiting Europe’s largest atomic power plant that inspectors would stay at the Russian-occupied facility but that signing a document on security on the site was “unrealistic” while the two sides were still fighting. Ensuring water for cooling the plant was a priority, he said, adding that the station could operate safely for “some time”. Gunfire briefly halted Grossi’s convoy as it headed back to Ukrainian-held territory following the visit to the Zaporizhzhia plant, but the delegation was in no immediate danger, a spokesperson for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said. Ukrainian fighter pilots are being trained to fly F-16 jets, Nato’s secretary general has revealed. Nato allies have yet to agree on delivering the so-called fourth-generation US fighters to Ukraine, but Jens Stoltenberg said the training of Ukrainian personnel was under way. A group of UN experts said they had written to Moscow raising concerns about the use of torture by Russian military forces on Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war. Republican and Democratic members of the US Congress introduced legislation that would make it easier for Ukraine to fund its fight against Russian invaders by using seized and frozen Russian assets. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned a Canadian diplomat in Moscow in protest over the confiscation of an Antonov plane in Toronto, and warned that Russian-Canadian relations were on the “verge of being severed”. The Russian and Algerian presidents, Vladimir Putin and Abdelmadjid Tebboune, pledged to deepen their two countries’ “strategic partnership” during a three-day state visit by Tebboune as the Kremlin seeks to pivot towards Asia and Africa. A Russian anti-war activist died in a detention centre in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, where he had alleged he was being mistreated, his lawyer said. The US, the UK, the Netherlands and Denmark announced they would partner to send defence equipment, including hundreds of missiles, to Ukraine. A joint statement released by the British government said delivery of the equipment had already begun and should be completed “within several weeks”. As many as 100 Russian troops gathered for a motivational speech near Ukraine’s eastern frontline may have been killed in a strike earlier this week, prompting fury among Russian military bloggers. Members of the European Parliament called on Nato allies to honour their commitment to Ukraine by inviting the country to join the defence alliance and support opening EU accession negotiations this year. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged Switzerland to allow the re-export of weapons to Ukraine, telling its parliament that the move would be vital in combating the Russian invasion. Russian missiles hit two industrial facilities in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Thursday, and an elderly woman was killed by Russian fire in the southern Kherson region, local officials said. The Kryvyi Rih mayor, Oleksandr Vilkul, reported no deaths in the latest attack on Zelenskiy’s home town but said a 38-year-old man was reportedly wounded. Russian forces claimed they successfully hit drone production facilities in Ukraine using high-precision, long-range weapons. The defence ministry and the Federal Security Service considered it possible to hold elections on 10 September in the four Ukrainian regions that Russia claims to have annexed, the state news agency Tass reported the head of Russia’s electoral commission as saying."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/10/ukraine-air-force-claims-russian-jets-destroyed-crimea-raid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-10T18:38:18Z","webTitle":"Ukraine air force claims up to a dozen Russian jets destroyed in Crimea raid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/10/ukraine-air-force-claims-russian-jets-destroyed-crimea-raid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/10/ukraine-air-force-claims-russian-jets-destroyed-crimea-raid","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine air force claims up to a dozen Russian jets destroyed in Crimea raid","bodyText":"Ukraine’s air force said it believed that up to a dozen Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground following Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which Russia said killed one, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine said the country had carried out the attack – but no public claim of responsibility was made by Kyiv of the incident that one expert believes may have been the product of a daring raid rather than a missile strike. Yuriy Ignat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, told national television that from studying video footage of the incident, it was clear “the aircraft weapons depot was hit”. He said: “And if additionally a dozen planes are destroyed there, it will be a real small victory.” The country’s air force also said on its Facebook page that “nine invader planes” had been destroyed in a short posting, although it did not specify in that message where or how it believed they had been eliminated. Ukraine’s president, Volodoymyr Zelenskiy, referred to the attack in his latest national address on Wednesday evening. “In just one day, the occupiers lost 10 combat aircraft: nine in Crimea and one more in the direction of Zaporizhzhia,” he said. “The occupiers also suffer new losses of armoured vehicles, warehouses with ammunition, logistics routes.” The claims could not be verified but the Saky airbase is home to Su-30M fighters, Su-24 bombers and the Il-76 transporter, used regularly to launch missile strikes into Ukraine and patrol the Black Sea and surrounding area. Ukraine’s public coyness about the attack is partly designed to preserve some ambiguity about the means used, sources said, prompting broad speculation as to how Kyiv was able to strike so deep behind Russian lines, in one of the first attacks on Crimean soil since the Russian invasion began in February. Justin Bronk, an aviation analyst with the Rusi thinktank, said that, having studied social media videos of the incident, he could see no evidence of incoming missiles and that he was “almost certain” there were “secondary explosions” of ammunition stores or fuel bunkers which were stored on or near the airstrip. That led him to conclude that “the most likely current theory for me is that Ukrainian special forces carried out the attack by infiltrating close enough to the base to launch and guide in small UAVs [drones] or loitering munitions, to hit either parked aircraft or fuel trucks/storage”. Other remarks and videos suggest the damage caused was considerable. Sergey Aksyonov, the Russian-appointed head of occupied Crimea, said that 13 had been wounded, 252 people had been rehoused and 62 apartment blocks had been damaged. A day earlier he had said one person had been killed. A social media video, geolocated to a car park near the base, showed several cars burnt out or damaged with their windows blown out, apparently from the ferocity of the blasts. Another brief video shows a destroyed jet on the tarmac, although it could not be verified. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told the BBC the UK was still trying to establish facts on the airbase explosions, but added that he believed it was unlikely western weapons were involved. The airbase, he argued, was a legitimate target for Ukraine’s armed forces. Ukrainian officials have also privately briefed that the attack was carried out with homegrown weapons. One political source said that Kyiv was keen to avoid using only US-made weapons to strike in the rear, because it is otherwise feared it could prompt the narrative that the US is effectively fighting a proxy war, which the Russians could exploit. On Tuesday, speculation had centred around whether the airbase had been struck by long range missiles, such as Ukraine’s home manufactured Neptune anti-ship missiles, modified to attack ground targets, from the area around Odesa, about 165 miles (265km) away. But there have been other hints that the attack could have been a daring raid, targeting munitions or fuel. Mikhail Polodyak, a key adviser to president Zelenskiy speculated in a TV interview on Tuesday along those lines, in which he also denied Ukrainian responsibility for the attack. “Could it be someone from the partisan movement that is gaining momentum? Of course, because the people who lived in the occupation [of Crimea] understand that the time of the occupation is ending and you need to show your position,” the adviser told the Dozhd TV channel. The attack on the airbase has been a morale boost for Kyiv, which is seeking to demonstrate it can mount a counter-offensive in the south of the country and retake the occupied city of Kherson before autumn sets in. Overnight, Zelenskiy talked about Crimea, but did not mention the attack on the airbase directly. “There will be no stable and lasting peace in many countries on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea as long as Russia is able to use our peninsula as its military base,” the president said. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukraine said 13 people were killed in overnight shelling near Nikopol, across the river Dnipro from the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant at Enerhodar. Ukraine said the attackers were hiding on the site of the power plant, preventing them from being counterattacked. G7 foreign ministers warned in a joint statement that Russia risked “the safety and security” of the site and called on Moscow to allow safety inspectors to immediately visit from the International Atomic Energy Agency – and to hand back the nuclear plant back to Ukraine. Russia, in turn, said it had requested that the issue be discussed by the UN security council on Thursday, after what it said were, “strikes by Kyiv” on the facility – the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Petro Kotin, the president of Energoatom – the Ukrainian company that owns the plant – said that Russia was trying to switch the plant over to supply Crimea with electricity, instead of Ukraine, which he described as risky. “To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system,” he said. “At the moment, the plant is operating with only one production line, which is an extremely dangerous way of working.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-sustains-losses-in-southern-ukraine-biden-doesnt-think-putin-will-use-nuclear-weapons","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-12T18:00:06Z","webTitle":"Russian nuclear strike would trigger a ‘physical response’ by Nato, says official – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-sustains-losses-in-southern-ukraine-biden-doesnt-think-putin-will-use-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-sustains-losses-in-southern-ukraine-biden-doesnt-think-putin-will-use-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"headline":"Russian nuclear strike would trigger a ‘physical response’ by Nato, says official – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv and Moscow. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s army boasted of territorial gains near the strategically vital southern city of Kherson on Wednesday. Five settlements in the Beryslav district in the north-east of the Kherson region – Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone – were said to have been taken from Russian forces over the day. Nato allies delivered new air defence systems in the wake of Russia’s recent missile attacks across the country. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of sophisticated National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (Nasams) from the US. A Russian nuclear strike would “almost certainly” trigger a “physical response” from Ukraine’s allies and potentially from Nato, a senior NATO official has said. Any use of nuclear weapons by Moscow would have “unprecedented consequences” for Russia, the official was quoted by Reuters as saying. At least seven people were killed and eight injured in a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region said. “There is no military logic in such shelling - only an unbridled desire to kill as many of our people as possible and intimidate others,” Pavlo Kyrylenko said. President Vladimir Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, Putin said in an address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas. There is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity, Alexei Miller said, adding that gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has appealed to citizens and businesses to reduce their electricity consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. People are being asked to reduce power consumption from 5pm to 10pm across Ukraine by 25% in order to stabilise the power system, which had been damaged by Russian missile attacks. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi had warned earlier that the loss of off-site power at the facility, Europe’s largest, was “deeply worrying”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the ZNPP, has accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators after shelling of a substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region caused the plant to lose power. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them. A senior Ukrainian official dismissed the investigation as “nonsense”. A crowdfunding appeal that was launched after Russian attacks on cities across the country on Monday has raised $9.6m (£8.7m) in 24 hours for the purchase of kamikaze drones for the Ukrainian armed forces. An initial 50 Ram II drones, unmanned aerial vehicles with a 3kg explosive payload, designed and built by Ukrainian companies, will be bought with the money, along with three control stations. President Putin will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in what is likely to be a “very interesting” meeting in Kazakhstan tomorrow, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. The Russian and Turkish presidents are expected to meet in Kazakhstan’s capital tomorrow on the sidelines of a regional summit. President Joe Biden has said he believes Vladimir Putin is a “rational actor” who badly misjudged his prospects of occupying Ukraine. The US president told CNN on Tuesday that he believed his Russian counterpart had underestimated the ferocity of Ukrainian defiance in the face of invasion, but does not believe he would resort to using a tactical nuclear weapon. Ukraine’s ministry of reintegration has confirmed that 37 Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia have now returned home. The children had been deported from the Russian-occupied territory of Kharkiv region in August, it said in a statement on Facebook. The Kremlin has denied a report that Elon Musk spoke with President Vladimir Putin before publishing his “peace plan” for Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. In a mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Ian Bremmer said the Tesla CEO had told him that Putin was “prepared to negotiate”. Musk has also denied the report. A Russian nuclear strike would “almost certainly” trigger a “physical response” from Ukraine’s allies and potentially from Nato, a senior NATO official has said. Any use of nuclear weapons by Moscow would have “unprecedented consequences” for Russia, the official was quoted by Reuters as saying. It would “almost certainly be drawing a physical response from many allies, and potentially from Nato itself,” the official said. The official added that Moscow was using its nuclear threats mainly to deter the alliance and other countries from directly entering its war on Ukraine. Ukraine’s army boasted of territorial gains near the strategically vital southern city of Kherson on Wednesday as Nato allies delivered new air defence systems in the wake of Russia’s recent missile attacks across the country. After 48 hours of Ukrainian cities coming under heavy fire, the government in Kyiv could celebrate positive news from both the frontlines and its diplomatic efforts to secure ground-to-air systems. Five settlements in the Beryslav district in the north-east of the Kherson region – Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone – were said to have been taken from Russian forces over the day. Kherson was the first city to fall to Russia following the invasion on 24 February and it is a crucial strategic and symbolic target for Ukraine’s southern counterattack. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of sophisticated National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (Nasams) from the US. “A new era of air defence has begun in Ukraine,” Reznikov tweeted. Iris-Ts from Germany are already here. Nasams are coming. This is only the beginning. And we need more.” Read the full story here: Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand, has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine, which includes ammunition, communications equipment, winter clothing, armoured vehicles and artillery. Some $15m (£9.8m) in winter clothing and $15.2m (£9.9m) in howitzer ammunition make up the bulk of the latest military assistance package, Anand announced as she sat down with her Nato counterparts in Brussels. Canada also will provide another $15.3m (£10m) worth of the high-tech cameras the Ukrainians have been using on their drones, along with more satellite communication services. More than 50 countries gathered for a meeting at Nato headquarters to promise more weapons, including air defences, for Ukraine after Russia launched its most intense missile strikes across the country since the war began. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, opened the gathering by condemning the Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s, deadly missile attacks against “targets with no military purpose”. Sitting beside his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, Austin said: The whole world has just seen yet again the malice and cruelty of Putin’s war of choice, rooted in aggression and waged with deep contempt for the rules of war. But Russia’s latest assaults have only deepened the determination of the Ukrainian people and further united countries of goodwill from every region on Earth. More than 90,000 Russian fighters have been listed as “irrecoverable” military losses since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the Russian media project iStories. “Irrecoverable losses” is a category that includes servicemen who were killed, went missing, died from their wounds or were disabled and cannot return to military service. The figure is close to US and UK estimates. In August, Britain’s defence minister, Ben Wallace, said the Russian army’s total losses, including deaths, injuries, and desertions, exceeded 80,000. Here’s more from Gazprom’s chief, Alexei Miller, who has warned that “whole towns” in Europe could freeze this winter despite the continent having almost filled its gas storage facilities. Speaking at the Russia Energy Week conference in Moscow earlier this afternoon, Miller said: Winter can be relatively warm, but one week or even five days will be abnormally cold and it’s possible that whole towns and lands, god forbid, will freeze. During days of peak winter demand, Europe could lack some 800m cubic metres of natural gas per day, or one third of its total consumption, Miller said. European gas inventories are currently about 91% full, with the most pessimistic estimates suggesting they will be at 5% capacity in March, he added. US president Joe Biden has said he has not seen any movement from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on the release of the American basketball star Brittney Griner. Griner, a two-time Olympic basketball gold medalist, was sentenced to nine years in prison in August after Russian police said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage at Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow in February. On Monday, Griner’s defence team appealed against her conviction for narcotics possession and trafficking. The US has said she was wrongfully detained and has offered to exchange her for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year prison sentence in America. Asked if he had seen any action on Griner’s case, Biden replied: Not from Putin. During his interview with CNN on Tuesday, Biden said he would be willing to meet Putin at the G20 meeting next month if the Russian leader wanted to discuss the detained WNBA star. He said: I have no intention of meeting with him. But for example, if he came to me at the G20 and said I want to talk about the release of Griner, I’d meet with him. I mean, it would depend. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has tweeted a photo of himself returning to Kyiv after meeting with President Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg yesterday. At Tuesday’s meeting shown on Russian state television, Putin told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief that the situation around Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was “of concern”. The Russian leader also told Grossi that Moscow was open for dialogue and would discuss “all issues” concerning the facility’s operations. Russian authorities are mobilising men from the country’s most vulnerable groups to fight in Ukraine, according to a report. Officials in Moscow have taken men from charity centres for the homeless and needy, as well as hostels where labour migrants live, the Moscow Times has cited a report by the independent Mediazona news website. Dozens of homeless men have been taken off the streets and brought to military enlistment offices in the weeks since President Vladimir Putin declared a “partial” mobilisation, according to a group that hands out food to the capital’s homeless community. One source told Mediazona: The police come here without anyone asking. They see a queue of people waiting for food — and then they grab them by the scruff of the neck, against their will. The men are then loaded onto buses and transported to military enlistment offices, the source said. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has appealed to citizens and businesses to reduce their electricity consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. People are being asked to reduce power consumption from 5pm to 10pm across Ukraine by 25% in order to stabilise the power system, which had been damaged by Russian missile attacks. In a statement, Shmyhal said: We are grateful to all Ukrainians who deliberately reduced electricity consumption yesterday and the night before yesterday. The total saving was 10%. We also thank the heads of regions, heads of communities, who took a responsible approach and cut power consumption in communities. He also appealed to people to use gas and coal sparingly after turning on the heating: The minimum permissible indoor temperature this winter will be 16 degrees Celsius, while the average temperature will be 18 degrees. This is a necessity and this is our contribution to the victory. After all, it depends on each of us how we will get through this winter.” It’s 6pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: At least seven people were killed and eight injured in a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region said. “There is no military logic in such shelling - only an unbridled desire to kill as many of our people as possible and intimidate others,” Pavlo Kyrylenko said. President Vladimir Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, Putin said in an address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas. There is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity, Alexei Miller said, adding that gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi had warned earlier that the loss of off-site power at the facility, Europe’s largest, was “deeply worrying”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the ZNPP, has accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators after shelling of a substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region caused the plant to lose power. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them. A senior Ukrainian official dismissed the investigation as “nonsense”. A crowdfunding appeal that was launched after Russian attacks on cities across the country on Monday has raised $9.6m (£8.7m) in 24 hours for the purchase of kamikaze drones for the Ukrainian armed forces. An initial 50 Ram II drones, unmanned aerial vehicles with a 3kg explosive payload, designed and built by Ukrainian companies, will be bought with the money, along with three control stations. Pope Francis condemned Russia’s “relentless bombings” of Ukrainian cities and appealed to “those who have the fate of the war in their hands” to stop. The Vatican’s number two, secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said the bombing of unarmed civilians “is beyond any logic. It is to be totally condemned”. President Putin will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in what is likely to be a “very interesting” meeting in Kazakhstan tomorrow, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. The Russian and Turkish presidents are expected to meet in Kazakhstan’s capital tomorrow on the sidelines of a regional summit. President Joe Biden has said he believes Vladimir Putin is a “rational actor” who badly misjudged his prospects of occupying Ukraine. The US president told CNN on Tuesday that he believed his Russian counterpart had underestimated the ferocity of Ukrainian defiance in the face of invasion, but does not believe he would resort to using a tactical nuclear weapon. Ukraine’s ministry of reintegration has confirmed that 37 Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia have now returned home. The children had been deported from the Russian-occupied territory of Kharkiv region in August, it said in a statement on Facebook. The Kremlin has denied a report that Elon Musk spoke with President Vladimir Putin before publishing his “peace plan” for Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. In a mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Ian Bremmer said the Tesla CEO had told him that Putin was “prepared to negotiate”. Musk has also denied the report. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today with all the latest from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Russia has depleted a significant proportion of its precision-guided ammunition in its invasion of Ukraine, according to a senior Nato official. Reuters quotes the official as saying that Moscow’s industry cannot produce all kinds of ammunition and weapon systems due to western sanctions. President Vladimir Putin will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in what is likely to be a “very interesting” meeting in Kazakhstan tomorrow, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. Speaking to reporters, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said: Now many say that the Turks are ready to come up with other initiatives in the context of the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict. There are reports in the press that the Turkish side is putting forward specific considerations in this regard, I do not exclude that Erdoğan will actively touch on this topic during the Astana contact. So a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us. The Russian and Turkish presidents are expected to meet in Kazakhstan’s capital tomorrow on the sidelines of a regional summit. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has previously said the potential talks between Russia and the west could be discussed during the meeting. The Netherlands will deliver €15m worth of air defence missiles to Ukraine in reaction to Russian air raids on Ukraine earlier this week. Reuters reports the the defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, wrote in a letter to parliament: “These attacks ... can only be met with unrelenting support for Ukraine and its people.” Earlier we reported that Pope Francis had condemned the recent wave of attacks on Ukrainian cities, saying: “My heart is always with the Ukrainian people, especially the residents of the places that have been hit by relentless bombings. May the Lord’s spirit transform the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that the hurricane of violence stops and peaceful coexistence in justice can be rebuilt.” Reuters has now reported an additional quote from the Vatican number two, secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin. Asked if the attacks could be considered war crimes, he said he was not qualified to make such a technical, juridical judgment. “But certainly they are unacceptable acts that cry out vengeance before God and before humanity, because bombing unarmed civilians is beyond any logic. It is to be totally condemned,” Parolin said. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the aftermath of Russian attacks on central Kyiv earlier this week. Power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is surrounded by Russian troops, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi, director general of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, had warned earlier today that the nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, had lost all external power needed for vital safety systems for the second time in five days. Grossi has now tweeted that he has been informed by his team that the external power to the facility has been restored: Earlier today, Grossi, who met yesterday with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said IAEA monitors at the Zaporizhzhia plant reported the interruption in external power, and said backup diesel generators were keeping nuclear safety and security equipment operational. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas, saying there is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity. Speaking at the Russia Energy Week conference in Moscow, Alexei Miller said gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months. Miller also said repairs to the damaged Nord Stream pipelines would take at least a year, and that Russia had still not been granted access to the area of damage. Germany and the EU “should respond” if they are interested in restoring the pipeline, he said. Simon Smith, a former British ambassador to Ukraine, writes for us today about how Russian missile strikes on Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine over the past two days stem from Vladimir Putin’s desperation. In their vicious efforts to extinguish Ukraine, the Russians have reached an unprecedented state of weakness and cluelessness, he writes. Putin is signalling that he is paying no heed to any waning commitment to the war among the population at large, following his mobilisation decision. And that he’s listening more closely to those who have been vocally critical of the army’s poor performance, and who have called for a tougher, (even) more ruthless offensive approach. But it goes further than that. It’s also an intimidatory message to Russian citizens opposed to his needless war – or even those simply less convinced of its good sense or justice. Read the full piece here: Mykhailo Podolyak, a presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on the west to officially recognise Russia’s aggression and acts in Ukraine as genocide. Russian forces have committed attacks on civilian infrastructure, mass executions and rape, forced deportations, separated families and destroyed Ukrainian literature in schools, Podolyak said on Twitter. Here’s more from President Vladimir Putin’s address to the Russian Energy Week international forum earlier today, where he proposed that Moscow could redirect gas supplies for the Nord Stream pipelines to the Black Sea to create a major European gas hub in Turkey. Putin said it was possible to repair the damaged pipelines but that Russia and Europe should decide their fate. He said: We could move the lost volumes along the Nord Streams along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea region and thus make the main routes for the supply of our fuel, our natural gas to Europe through Turkey, creating the largest gas hub for Europe in Turkey. He added: That is, of course, if our partners are interested in this. And economic feasibility, of course. The Kremlin has denied a report that Elon Musk spoke with President Vladimir Putin before publishing his “peace plan” for Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. In a mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Ian Bremmer said the Tesla CEO had told him that Putin was “prepared to negotiate”. Musk has since denied the report. Asked if Musk had spoken to Putin prior to publishing the Twitter poll, the Kremlin’s spokesperson said: No, this is not true. The pair had communicated over the phone “about a year and a half ago”, Peskov added without providing any details. In a reply to a tweet, Musk said he had spoken to the Russian leader “only once and that was about 18 months ago”. The subject matter of that conversation was “space”, he added. Bremmer subsequently reiterated his initial claims, and said Musk had told him he had spoken with Putin “directly about Ukraine”. We reported yesterday that children’s doctor Oksana Leontieva was among those killed by Russian missile strikes on Kyiv earlier this week. Leontieva was on her way to work on Monday morning after dropping her son at kindergarten when a Russian missile hit the Ukrainian capital. Now her father, Gregory, has told German newspaper Bild that her death has left her five-year-old son an orphan after his father recently died as well. He added: Oksana had called the hospital in the morning because the kindergarten couldn’t take her son due to warnings of a possible attack. In the end, they did take Grischa ... and she went to work. Gregory said the boy had not yet been told his mother had died. Gregory said: For now he thinks she is at work and working very hard. We will tell him today or tomorrow. The doctor’s funeral is due to be held later this week. The number of people wounded after a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka in Ukraine’s Donetsk region has risen to nine, according to a city official. At least seven people were killed after the Russian shelling on the market this morning, Vitalii Barabash, the head of the Avdiivka city military administration, said. In a statement on Telegram, Barabash said: Today is another black day for our Avdiivka. In the morning, the Russian evil spirits once again brought death to our land, sneakily, as always, shelling the central market with tanks and MLR systems during rush hour. Seven residents of Avdiivka were killed and nine were wounded. The European Commission wants at least €18bn (£15.8bn) in emergency aid to help Ukraine’s government stay afloat next year, as an economic crisis looms in the country. Officials in Brussels think the EU should provide at least half the €3bn-€3.5bn monthly running costs it estimates the Ukrainian state needs to function in 2023, the Guardian has learned. The financial aid would most likely be in the form of cheap loans with long repayment deadlines. But it would require EU member states to find extra money to guarantee the loans and potentially pay the interest. According to the World Bank, Ukraine’s economy is on course to shrink by more than one third (35%) in 2022, as a result of the widespread destruction of factories, infrastructure, fertile land, as well as the displacement of 14 million people. EU sources fear that if Ukraine cannot afford to pay its bills it could print money, triggering inflation. EU officials are optimistic about an agreement on the new financial aid, despite long delays in releasing €9bn funding for Ukraine promised in May. Nearly five months since the commission proposed €9bn in “macro financial assistance” for Ukraine, only €1bn has been released. Earlier this month, Brussels and Kyiv signed an agreement on the next €5bn, paving the way for a €2bn tranche to be released this month. EU member states have been wrangling over whether aid to Ukraine should be offered as non-repayable grants, as favoured by Germany, or cheap loans, the option backed by most member states. The money would allow the Ukrainian government to pay salaries, fund humanitarian relief and make emergency repairs to some essential infrastructure. But it falls far short of the vast costs of rebuilding Ukraine, estimated by the World Bank to be $349bn (€359bn, £315bn). President Vladimir Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational, in his address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The Russian leader said gas could still be supplied by one remaining intact part of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, he said. Putin says: Russia is ready to start such supplies. The ball is in the court of the EU. If they want, they can just open the tap. He went on to say that Russia has nothing to do with the sky-high energy prices that Europeans are facing this winter, instead blaming the west for stoking a global energy crisis. It was the poorest countries that would pay the highest price in terms of rising energy costs, Putin added. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is currently addressing the Russian Energy Week international forum’s plenary session. Large leaks that suddenly erupted in the Nord Stream gas pipelines running from Russia to Europe were an “act of international terrorism” that set a “dangerous precedent”. Putin says: There is no doubt it was an act of international terrorism, aiming to undermine the energy security of a whole continent. The calculation behind it was quite cynical, to block and destroy the cheap energy sources and deprive millions of people and industrial consumers of gas, heat, power and other resources. The “attack” against the Nord Stream pipelines was a “most dangerous precedent”, he continued: It shows that any piece of critical transport energy or communications infrastructure is at risk now. Putin goes on to blame Ukrainian special services for what he calls the “terrorist attack” against the Kerch bridge connecting Russia to Crimea. At least seven people were killed and eight injured in a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region said. In a statement, Pavlo Kyrylenko said: The Russians struck the central market where many people were at that time. He added: There is no military logic in such shelling - only an unbridled desire to kill as many of our people as possible and intimidate others. More to follow. Ukraine’s ministry of reintegration has confirmed that 37 Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia have now returned home. The children had been deported from the Russian-occupied territory of Kharkiv region in August, it said in a statement on Facebook. The statement reads: At the end of August, the little ones were forcibly taken out of Kharkiv region to the Russian township of Kabardinka (near Gelendzhik), despite the fact that everyone has parents. The families had been reunited, it said. The ministry described the return process as difficult but successful. A crowdfunding appeal that was launched after Russian attacks on cities across the country on Monday has raised $9.6m (£8.7m) in 24 hours for the purchase of kamikaze drones for the Ukrainian armed forces. An initial 50 Ram II drones, unmanned aerial vehicles with a 3kg explosive payload, designed and built by Ukrainian companies, will be bought with the money, along with three control stations. Further munitions would be secured over the coming days, said Serhiy Prytula, who organised the initiative. He said: “They wanted to scare us but we united even more. Remember: never infuriate Ukrainians. Never. The people have donated for the revenge, so we will ensure the revenge happens.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told G7 leaders on Tuesday via video conference that Russia had used a variety of munitions to strike Ukrainian cities over the previous two days, killing 20 people. “The enemy has used more than 100 cruise missiles, dozens of different drones, including Iranian Shaheds,” he said. “And every 10 minutes I receive a message about the enemy’s use of Iranian Shaheds.” Read the full story here: The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said rhetoric from western leaders on the potential use of nuclear weapons was “provocative”. Speaking to reporters during his regular briefing, Peskov said: We express our daily regret that Western heads of state – the US as well as European – engage in nuclear rhetoric every day. We consider this a pernicious and provocative practice. Russia does not want to take part in these exercises and does not take part in them. Leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) countries yesterday warned of “severe consequences” if Russia decided to use nuclear weapons, in a statement after a call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The US president, Joe Biden, warned that threats from Russia could result in catastrophic “mistakes” and “miscalculation”, a week after he said the risk of “nuclear Armageddon” was at its highest level in 60 years. Peskov added that there had been no attempt from either Washington or Moscow to discuss a potential meeting between Biden and President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin also denied reports from some regional officials that they were stepping up mobilisation efforts. “There is no new wave,” Peskov said, telling reporters to check with individual governors to see what they meant. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them. A statement from the Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed “the organiser of the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge was the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, its head Kyrylo Budanov, employees and agents. Currently, five citizens of Russia, three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia, who participated in the preparation of the crime, have been detained within the framework of the criminal case.” A senior Ukrainian official dismissed the investigation as “nonsense”. “The whole activity of the FSB and Investigative Committee is nonsense,” Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne cited interior minister spokesman Andriy Yusov as saying. He described the FSB and Investigative Committee as “fake structures that serve the Putin regime, so we will definitely not comment on their next statements”. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has described developments at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which has lost off-site power, as “deeply worrying”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators after shelling of a substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region caused the plant to lose power. Pope Francis on Wednesday condemned Russia’s “relentless bombings” of Ukrainian cities and appealed to “those who have the fate of the war in their hands” to stop. He was quoted as saying “My heart is always turned to the people of Ukraine, especially those living in places hit by the bombing”. The pontiff prayed for an intercession that “may change the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that they may cease this wave of violence and rebuild peaceful coexistence”. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is a “rational actor who has miscalculated significantly,” US president Joe Biden said in a clip of a CNN interview broadcast late on Tuesday. Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range airstrikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The leaders of the G7 on Tuesday condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks on cities across Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms” and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border. Roughly 30% of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been hit by Russia since Monday, officials said. As millions in Ukraine are facing blackouts due to the attacks, the government has urged civilians to cut their electricity use and not use domestic appliances such as ovens and washing machines. That is it from me Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly. Russia’s security forces have released what they claim is an X-ray image of the cargo that caused the explosion at the weekend on the Crimea bridge. The veracity of the image, and its source, has not been independently verified. It has been issued as part of their investigation which has led to the arrest of eight individuals today [see 7.13am]. Russia has claimed the plan was masterminded by Ukrainian officials, a suggestion which has been dismissed as “nonsense” by Ukraine’s interior minister spokesperson, Andriy Yusov [see 9.08am]. Russia’s Dmitry Peskov has said that comments made by Nato General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg could be considered confirmation that Nato is fighting on Ukraine’s side in Kyiv’s conflict with Russia. Reuters remind us that yesterday Stoltenberg said that a Russian victory in Ukraine would be “a defeat for us all” During his regular morning media briefing, the Kremlin spokesperson also said rhetoric from western leaders on the potential use of nuclear weapons was harmful and provocative. “We express our daily regret that western heads of state engage in nuclear rhetoric every day,” Peskov said, adding that such a practice was “provocative”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators. It has been cut off from off-site power. In a statement posted to Telegram, Energoatom said: This morning, 12 October at 8.59am, as a result of rocket fire by Russian troops, the Dniprovska substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region was damaged. As a result, the 750-kV communication line of ZANP – Dniprovska was accidentally opened. As a result, the ZNPP was completely de-energized. Diesel generators turned on automatically. Energoatom prepared and sent another batch of diesel fuel to the ZNPP. However, as of 10am, the Russian side does not allow the company’s convoy of vehicles to pass. Russian shelling and damage to energy infrastructure related to the operation of nuclear power plants is the same manifestation of nuclear terrorism as direct shelling of the ZNPP, and leads to the same consequences and threats of a radiation accident. The occupiers continue to neglect the nuclear and radiation safety of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, threatening the world with a radiation disaster. The claims have not been independently verified. Both sides have previously accused the other of shelling the ZNPP directly, which sits in one of the occupied regions that Russia has claimed to “annex”. Pope Francis condemned Russia’s “relentless bombings” of Ukrainian cities and appealed to “those who have the fate of the war in their hands” to stop. He was quoted as saying “My heart is always turned to the people of Ukraine, especially those living in places hit by the bombing.” The pontiff prayed for an intercession that “may change the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that they may cease this wave of violence and rebuild peaceful coexistence”. A senior Ukrainian official dismissed as “nonsense” on Wednesday Russia’s investigation into an explosion last weekend that badly damaged a bridge linking the Russian mainland to the Crimea peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has blamed Ukraine’s security forces for the explosion, and earlier today Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said it had detained five Russians and three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia over the blast. “The whole activity of the FSB and Investigative Committee is nonsense,” Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne cited the interior minister spokesperson, Andriy Yusov, as saying when asked about Moscow’s allegations on the Crimea Bridge blast. Reuters reports Yusov described the FSB and Investigative Committee as “fake structures that serve the Putin regime, so we will definitely not comment on their next statements”. RIA Novosti, the Russian state-owned news agency, has a breaking news story quoting Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed leader of occupied Zaporizhzhia, saying that a nuclear safety zone cannot be established around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant “until the frontline is pushed at least 100km, otherwise it is unsafe”. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has described developments at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which has lost off-site power, as “deeply worrying”. Rafael Grossi tweeted: Our team at the ZNPP informed me this morning that the plant has lost all of its external power for the second time in five days. Its back-up diesel generators are now providing electricity for its nuclear safety and security functions. This repeated loss of the ZNPP’s off-site power is a deeply worrying development and it underlines the urgent need for a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the site. The ZNPP has been occupied by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff since early in Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine. Russia has claimed to have “annexed” Zaporizhzhia, and stated it intends to take the plant under its own operational framework. You can understand there being jitters about Europe’s power infrastructure after the Nord Stream pipeline incident, but Poland’s top official in charge of energy infrastructure, Mateusz Berger, has told Reuters by telephone that there are no grounds to believe the leak in the Polish section of the Druzhba oil pipeline was caused by sabotage. “Here we can talk about accidental damage,” he said. Reuters is carrying a report, citing the Russian Interfax news agency, that Russia’s Transneft state-owned pipeline monopoly said on Wednesday it had received notice from Polish operator Pern about a leak on the Druzhba oil pipeline. Transneft stated that oil continues to be pumped towards Poland, and that Pern had not yet said how long repairs would take. The pipeline was built by the Soviet Union in the 1960s to pump oil from eastern regions of Russia into the satellite states of the Soviet bloc, and it now carries oil to points in Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany. Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of Sumy, has posted to Telegram to say that “the night was quiet” in his region, but that in the morning Russians resumed shelling at the border. As of 10am local time he had no information on casualties. Ukrainian MP Lisa Yasko has been interviewed from Strasbourg by Sky News in the UK, and has said that delays in delivering assistance to Ukraine were “incredibly frustrating”, and that she felt little comfort from suggestions that there were no signs Russia was about to deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine. She told viewers: I know that sometimes, some western countries, they’re just far and they don’t feel the urgency, which is incredibly frustrating for us. Because you know, we don’t have time for discussion. So we are screaming, we are trying to to do everything possible to defend with our weapons, our people, every second. Asked about the head of British GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, talking down the prospect of the use of nuclear weapons, she said: I don’t think it can offer me a comfort, because the threat of nuclear war is very, very high. We understand that Putin doesn’t have any logic anymore. It’s not possible to justify Putin anymore. We understand that he is in the final battle of his life, where he wants to prove to all the world that he can do whatever he wants, including taking lands, killing thousands of people, destroying infrastructure, and we understand that nuclear threats and a strike is very possible. Yesterday Fleming said “I would hope that we would see indicators if they started to go down that path,” and suggested that “The way in which the Russian military machine and President Putin are conducting this war, they are staying within the doctrine that we understand for their use, including for nuclear weapons.” Here is a video clip from Joe Biden’s CNN TV interview, where he says that he believed his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had underestimated the ferocity of Ukrainian defiance in the face of invasion. ‘I think … he thought he was going to be welcomed with open arms, that this was the home of Mother Russia in Kyiv, and that he was going to be welcomed, and I think he just totally miscalculated,’ Biden said. Russia’s state-owned news agency RIA Novosti is carrying some more details of the plot to damage the Crimea bridge which Russian security forces claim to have revealed today. It reports: In early August, the cargo was sent from the seaport of Odesa to the Bulgarian Ruse [port] … From Bulgaria it proceeded to the Georgian port of Poti , and then to Armenia. From 29 September to 3 October, at the Transalliance terminal in Yerevan, the cargo was cleared … On a DAF truck registered in Georgia, the cargo crossed the Russian-Georgian border on 4 October at the Upper Lars checkpoint, two days later it was delivered and unloaded at a wholesale base in Armavir. On 7 October … the documents for the cargo were again changed. TEK-34 LLC from Ulyanovsk was indicated as the sender , and a non-existent company in the Crimea was indicated as the recipient. The movement of cargo along the entire route was controlled by an employee of the main intelligence directorate of the ministry of defence of Ukraine, who introduced himself to the participants in the scheme as “Ivan Ivanovich”. To coordinate actions, he used a virtual anonymous number, as well as a phone registered to a resident of Kremenchug. RIA reminds us that the explosion occurred on 8 October, and that the official account is “a truck exploded on the Crimean bridge after which seven tanks with fuel of a passing train caught fire. Two car spans partially collapsed, but the bridge arch supports were not damaged. Four people were killed, including a judge from Moscow.” Polish pipeline operator Pern detected a leak on Tuesday evening in one line of the Druzhba pipeline, which carries oil from Russia to Europe, it said on Wednesday. Pern said at this point the causes of the leak are unknown. It was detected in a section of the pipe around 70km from the central Polish city of Plock. The second line of the pipeline, and other elements of Pern’s infrastructure, were working as normal, Pern said. “At this point, all Pern services (technical, operational, in-house fire brigade and environmental protection) are taking action in accordance with the algorithms provided for this type of situation,” Reuters reports the operator said. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has claimed that five people were injured and 17 houses were damaged by fire from Ukrainian forces in the last 24 hours. Donetsk is one of the occupied regions that Russia has claimed to annex. The Donetsk People’s Republic was declared in 2014, and Russia, Syria and North Korea are the only UN member states to recognise it as a legitimate authority. The claims have not been independently verified. Serhai Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has posted an update on Telegram on Ukraine’s military progress in the occupied Luhansk region. He writes: The armed forces of Ukraine are moving forward little by little. The Russians are shelling our positions mainly with rocket and barrel artillery. The occupiers are building a multi-layer defence line in Luhansk region, the entire first section of the front line is mined by them. Our military has already encountered the first wave of partially mobilised Russians. Luhansk is one of the region of occupied Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex following a widely-derided “referendum”. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them, according to reports from the state-owned Tass news agency. It quotes a statement from the Federal Security Service (FSB) saying: The Federal Security Service, together with the Investigative Committee, established that the organiser of the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge was the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, its head Kyrylo Budanov, employees and agents. Currently, five citizens of Russia, three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia, who participated in the preparation of the crime, have been detained within the framework of the criminal case. The FSB claims that the explosives which caused a section of the bridge to collapse were sent from Odessa through Bulgaria, Georgia and Armenia. Tass reports that the cargo carrying the explosives was being sent to a non-existent company in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

Most have reportedly been refused entry. There has been an exodus of conscription-age men from Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered a partial mobilisation on 21 September, but most fled by road, rail and air to Europe, and neighbouring former Soviet Union countries, like Georgia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. On Tuesday, South Korean broadcaster KBS reported that at least 21 Russians had arrived aboard yachts at ports in the south of the country, but only two had been granted entry, while others were refused as authorities deemed their purpose “ambiguous”. KBS reported that three yachts had docked in the southeastern port city of Pohang over the past several days, mostly carrying Russian men in their 20-30s. An official at Pohang’s coast guard declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. A justice ministry official said he did not have details about the yacht cases, but Russians are in general allowed to enter the country without a visa as long as they obtain prior approval via South Korea’s electronic travel authorisation system. The UK Ministry of Defence has published its latest update on the situation in Ukraine, in which it reports that 60% of the “Shahed” drones launched by Russia on 10 October were destroyed in the air. The drones are manufactured in Iran. “These UAVs are slow and fly at low altitudes making lone aircraft easy to target using conventional air defences. There is a realistic possibility that Russia has achieved some success by attacking with several UAVs at the same time,” according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accepted an invitation to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bangkok next month, according to a report in the Bangkok Post, which cites an unnamed security source. Both the G20 and Apec summits will be held in Southeast Asia in November, with gatherings overshadowed by the war in Ukraine. Ministerial meetings held over the past year have been marred by confrontation and walkouts. Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden are reportedly expected to attend the G20 summit in Bali between 15 and 15th November, while Indonesia has also invited the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to attend. Apec will be held on 18 and 19 November. On Tuesday, Lavrov said that Putin would not turn down a meeting with Biden in Bali. Talking on Russian state TV, he said that Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate. He said US officials including the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, had said the US was willing to engage in discussions but Russia had refused. “This is a lie”, he added. Biden is not expected to be at Apec and will instead return home to attend his granddaughter’s wedding ceremony, according to Thai media. It is not known whether Xi will attend Apec. Would Lukashenko really throw Belarus into a war Russia is losing? Andrew Roth and Daniel Boffey tackle the question in a new analysis piece. Alexander Lukashenko, the dictatorial leader of Belarus, has executed a careful balancing act during the war in Ukraine. On 24 February, Russian troops that had massed on Belarusian territory surged across the border into Ukraine, using his country as a staging ground in the largest invasion in Europe since the second world war. But the Belarusian leader has not joined the war directly or sent his own troops into the fight, at times saying that he felt the invasion was “dragging on”. Now, meetings between Lukashenko and Vladimir Putin have once again raised fears he is about to enter the fray. Lukashenko has said that Belarus and Russia are to deploy a joint military group and that thousands of Russian troops will be arriving in his country in the coming days for drills. “We emphasise once again that the tasks of the regional force group are purely defensive. And all activities carried out at the moment are aimed at providing a sufficient response to actions near our borders,” the Belarusian defence minister, Viktor Khrenin, said in a statement on Tuesday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, sounded the alarm during a meeting of the G7 on Tuesday, proposing to send UN peacekeepers to the border between Ukraine and Belarus to prevent Lukashenko from launching a “provocation”. Despite the warning signs, there is considerable doubt that Lukashenko is ready to throw his own forces into a war that Russia is losing in Ukraine, even if he is under pressure from Putin. Energy exports appear to be helping Russia ride out Western sanctions, AFP reports. Moscow says inflation is easing and employment is virtually full, contradicting the predictions of a catastrophe from many financial experts. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday offered some support to Russia’s view, saying recession will be less severe than expected due to oil exports and relatively stable domestic demand. The IMF forecast the Russian economy to contract just 3.4% over the whole year, after contracting 21.8% during the second quarter at a quarterly annualised rate. It was only in June that the IMF forecast an annual drop of 6%. When US President Joe Biden was asked in a Tuesday evening interview on CNN whether he thinks Putin will use nuclear weapons, he said, “I don’t think he will.” Biden was speaking after warning last week that the world faced the most acute nuclear threat for 60 years –since the Cuban missile crisis. “The whole point I was making was it could lead to just a horrible outcome,” he told Tapper. “And not because anybody intends to turn it into a world war or anything, but just once you use a nuclear weapon, the mistakes that can be made, the miscalculations, who knows what would happen.” Russian troops have sustained equipment and personnel losses in Ukraine’s south, the Kyiv Independent reported, citing Ukraine’s Operational Command. “Ukraine’s Operational Command ‘South’ reported that they completed over 300 fire missions, targeting and damaging two Russian Gvozdika self-propelled howitzers and an APC,” the Kyiv Independent said in a tweet. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the latest developments for the next while. Russian troops have sustained losses in Ukraine’s south following 300 fire missions, Ukraine’s Operational Command reported overnight. Meanwhile, in an interview with CNN on Tuesday evening, US President Joe Biden said he doesn’t think Putin will use a tactical nuclear weapon. Biden was speaking after warning last week that the world faced the most acute nuclear threat for 60 years –since the Cuban missile crisis. We’ll have more on this shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments in the conflict: Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range airstrikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The leaders of the G7 condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks on cities across Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms” and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, described Russia’s attacks as “a profound change in the nature of this war”. During Russia’s strikes in recent days, cruise missiles and armed drones rained down on parks, playgrounds, power stations and other civilian targets. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is a “rational actor who has miscalculated significantly,” US president Joe Biden said in a clip of a CNN interview broadcast on Tuesday. Ukrainian authorities said on Tuesday they exhumed the bodies of dozens of people, including civilians and a one-year-old baby, to determine the cause of death after the retreat of Russian troops from Lyman and Sviatohirsk, two recently liberated towns in the eastern Donetsk region. Roughly 30% of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been hit by Russia since Monday, officials said. As millions in Ukraine are facing blackouts due to the attacks, the government has urged civilians to cut their electricity use and not use domestic appliances such as ovens and washing machines. The Kremlin has confirmed that Putin will meet Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday to discuss Ukraine. Moscow would not turn down a meeting between Putin and Biden at the G20 meeting next month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate, Lavrov said in an interview on Russian state television. Putin has told the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency that he is “open to dialogue” on the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Meanwhile the deputy head of the Zaporizhzhia power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. Valeriy Martynyuk was taken on Monday and is being detained in an unknown location, Energoatom said in a post on Telegram. Elon Musk denied a report that he spoke with Putin before tweeting a proposal to end the war in Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. Belarus’ defence ministry said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, it claimed. Russian strikes have damaged hundreds of cultural sites, Zelenskiy said as he urged the UN cultural agency to expel Russia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Unesco World Heritage Committee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/11/which-energy-firms-met-boris-johnson-and-how-big-are-their-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-11T15:54:07Z","webTitle":"Which energy firms met Boris Johnson – and how big are their profits?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/11/which-energy-firms-met-boris-johnson-and-how-big-are-their-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/11/which-energy-firms-met-boris-johnson-and-how-big-are-their-profits","fields":{"headline":"Which energy firms met Boris Johnson – and how big are their profits?","bodyText":"Boris Johnson met executives from some of Britain’s biggest energy companies on Thursday to discuss the cost of living crisis. Johnson was flanked by the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, and the business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. Zahawi said afterwards that the energy firms agreed to “do more to help the people who most need it” – but did not specify what that would entail. The executives were from power-generation companies – which own assets including windfarms and nuclear power stations – rather than the oil and gas companies hit by the windfall tax, officially known as the Energy Profits Levy, after raking in bumper profits caused in part by the war in Ukraine. However, there is a lingering threat that the levy may be extended to electricity generation companies amid accusations that they have also enjoyed a bonanza from high energy prices.

Blinken made the warning to the Chinese state councillor Wang Yi on Saturday evening at a meeting on the sidelines of the Munich security conference during which he also rebuked China over the use of an alleged spy balloon over US soil. In a blunt meeting he also urged China to stop helping Russia evade the impact of sanctions. China’s trade with Russia is increasing and it has been buying Russian oil, but probably below the US$60 per barrel price cap imposed by the EU and G7 group of states. Blinken told US networks that the US had information China was considering whether to give Russia assistance, possibly including guns and weapons, for the Ukraine war. “The concern that we have now is, based on information we have, that they’re considering providing lethal support,” Blinken told CBS’s Face the Nation shortly after he met with Wang. “And we’ve made very clear to them that that could cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship.” Blinken told NBC’s Meet the Press that China has not yet crossed the line of providing lethal assistance but he would be putting out evidence soon to show how Beijing was seriously considering providing Russia with equipment including weapons He said of his meeting with Wang there was no apology from China about the spy balloon over US soil. “This was an opportunity to speak very clearly and very directly about the fact that China sent a surveillance balloon over our territory, violating our sovereignty, violating international law. And I told him quite simply that that was unacceptable and can never happen again.” The US believes China may already be providing some surveillance information to the Wagner group, the mercenary wing that works alongside the Russian army. Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, in her speech to the security conference warned China against providing lethal equipment to a country that she said the US had judged was committing crimes against humanity. But Harris in her remarks did not assert that such lethal aid was about to be provided. The US warnings about China’s intentions come in the context of a Chinese proposal to reveal a peace plan for Ukraine in a speech by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, coinciding with the 24 February anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Wang revealed the intention to launch the plan in his speech to the security conference on Saturday, and has been briefing leaders from France, Germany and Italy on China’s intentions, possibly in a bid to drive a wedge between EU states and the US. The US has indicated it believes the plan is likely to be a vague assertion of the value of peaceful dialogue, territorial integrity and sovereignty, but without going into any details. European diplomats briefed on the plans also seemed sceptical about the value of a broad enunciation of vague principles, questioning whether China was really prepared to distance itself from its close partner Russia. On the other hand, China is probably the only external actor that could put effective diplomatic pressure on the Russian president, Vladimiir Putin, to rethink his strategy. Expressing the west’s scepticism, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said: “China has not been able to condemn the invasion,” adding the plan “is quite vague”. Peace was only possible if Russia respected Ukraine’s sovereignty, he said. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dymytro Kuleba, was due to meet Wang on Sunday and expressed hope that China’s foreign policy principles would drive Beijing to accept the Ukrainian case. “We believe that compliance with the principle of territorial integrity is China’s fundamental interest in the international arena. And that commitment to the observance and protection of this principle is a driving force for China, greater than other arguments offered by Ukraine, the United States, or any other country,” he said. Some fear the plan may be designed to head off support in the so-called global south for any resolution to the UN general assembly asserting support for Ukraine. Such a resolution either at the general assembly or to the smaller UN security council has been under discussion to mark the anniversary. The last time the issue was addressed by the general assembly, Ukraine received the support of 141 states, and it may be hard to increase that level of support. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, welcomed any effort by China to use its influence with Moscow, telling reporters she had “talked intensively” with Wang during a bilateral meeting on Friday about “what a just peace means: not rewarding the attacker, the aggressor, but standing up for international law and for those who have been attacked”. “A just peace,” she added, “presupposes that the party that has violated territorial integrity – meaning Russia – withdraws its troops from the occupied country.” In the speeches of both the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, there was no support for early peace talks, with both men saying the west may have to endure a long conflict. Wang in his speech suggested there was a chance Europe was more eager to settle than the US. He said: “We need to think calmly, especially our friends in Europe, about what efforts should be made to stop the warfare; what framework should there be to bring lasting peace to Europe; what role should Europe play to manifest its strategic autonomy.” There were other sentiments in Wang’s outline plan that the west can welcome, including its opposition to the use of threats of nuclear war, or attacks on civilian nuclear power stations. The references to the UN charter and territorial integrity may also be helpful to the west, but it was coupled with a reference to Russia having legitimate security concerns. Some diplomats welcomed the acknowledgment that China could no longer simply treat the war as a strictly European matter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/20/russia-ukraine-war-putin-agrees-to-allow-inspectors-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T18:09:48Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: explosion reported in Crimea as UK says attacks behind Russian lines hitting logistics – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/20/russia-ukraine-war-putin-agrees-to-allow-inspectors-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/20/russia-ukraine-war-putin-agrees-to-allow-inspectors-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: explosion reported in Crimea as UK says attacks behind Russian lines hitting logistics – as it happened","bodyText":"We are closing this blog now.

Vladimir Putin’s agreement to allow independent inspectors to travel to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the French president, comes as concerns grow over fighting near the Russian-occupied site. Olaf Scholz has praised Alexei Navalny on the second anniversary of the jailed Russian opposition politician’s attempted poisoning. The US is planning to buy about 150,000 metric tonnes of grain from Ukraine in the next few weeks for an upcoming shipment of food aid from ports no longer blockaded by war, the World Food Programme chief has said. Multiple children have reportedly been injured following a Russian strike on a residential building in the Mykolaiv region of Ukraine. The US deputy treasury secretary, Wally Adeyemo, told Turkey’s deputy finance minister, Yunus Elitas, that Russian entities and individuals were attempting to use Turkey to bypass western sanctions imposed over Moscow’s war in Ukraine, the US treasury department said. In a phone call, the department said, the two also discussed efforts to implement and enforce sanctions against Russia, Reuters reports. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, has praised the “moving” sight of Ukrainian wheat headed for eastern Africa as part of an operation by the World Food Programme. Ukraine has launched a fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters at Sevastopol, where officials in the annexed Crimean peninsula said that at least one drone had been shot down by air defences. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine, posted this uplifting tweet: Shortly before his two-day trip to Canada, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, received support for his interest in Canadian liquid natural gas to help replace Russian gas imports from an unexpected ally, Ukrainian state-owned gas company Naftogaz. Kyiv has been at loggerheads with Berlin over its deal with Moscow to build the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and more recently over its deal with Canada to get a repaired turbine for the Nord Stream 1 delivered back to Germany. But the prospect of LNG deliveries to Europe from Canada is something that Naftogaz has also been working on itself. Naftogaz’s CEO, Yuriy Vitrenko, told Reuters that Canadian gas had many advantages. “Canadian suppliers do not have dominance in the German market, do not abuse it, as Gazprom, who is artificially decreasing supplies, ‘cornering the market’, and ripping off its customers,” he said. Ukraine’s ambassador to Ireland said her country had proved itself a “reliable partner” under a UN-backed deal allowing grain exports, as a shipment arrived in the southern Irish port of Foynes. The vessel, the Panama-flagged Navi Star carrying 33,000 tonnes of grain, arrived in Ireland after leaving southern Ukraine’s main port of Odesa two weeks ago. The shipment was one of the first to leave the war-torn country under a landmark deal struck with Russia and brokered by Turkey and the United Nations. Ukraine’s ambassador to Ireland, Larysa Gerasko, told AFP her country had proved itself a “reliable partner and reliable global grain exporter”. She said the continuation of shipments ultimately “depends on Russia, on Russian actions”, adding: “We expect Russia to keep to its commitments under the Black Sea grain initiative.” A message from António Guterres, the UN secretary general, on the World Food Programme effort.

Russia has claimed that Ukraine poisoned some of its servicemen in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia in late July. However, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry said in response that the alleged poisoning could have been caused by Russian forces eating expired canned meat. This has not been independently verified by the Guardian. Reuters reports: The Russian defence ministry said a number of Russian servicemen had been taken to a military hospital with signs of serious poisoning on 31 July. Tests showed a toxic substance, botulinum toxin type B, in their bodies, it said. “On the fact of chemical terrorism sanctioned by the Zelenskiy regime, Russia is preparing supporting evidence with the results of all the analyses,” the ministry said in a statement. It did not say how many servicemen had suffered or what their condition was now. It did not say what the “supporting evidence” was. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny has tweeted the following thread on the two-year anniversary of his poisoning with the nerve agent Novichok. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said that governments and the private sector should cooperate to bring Russian food and fertilisers as well as Ukrainian grain to world markets under a deal agreed last month. Speaking to a news conference in Istanbul, Guterres said: “The other part of this package deal is the unimpeded access to the global markets of Russian food and fertiliser, which are not subject to sanctions. “It is important that all governments and the private sector cooperate to bring them to market. “Getting more food and fertiliser out of Ukraine and Russia is crucial to further calm commodity markets and lower prices for consumers.” A Russian missile hit a residential area of a Ukrainian town, wounding 12 civilians and heightening fears of a nuclear accident during the war in Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, said on the Telegram messaging app that four children were among those wounded in an attack that damaged several private houses and a five-storey apartment building in Voznesensk. Reuters reports: The town is about 30 km (19 miles) from the Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant (PNPP), the second largest in Ukraine. State-run Energoatom, which manages all four Ukrainian nuclear energy generators, described the attack on Voznesensk as “another act of Russian nuclear terrorism”. “It is possible that this missile was aimed specifically at the Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant, which the Russian military tried to seize back at the beginning of March,” Energoatom said in a statement. The town of Enerhodar, where the Zaporizhzhia plant – Europe’s largest – is located, has come under repeated shelling, with Moscow and Kyiv trading blame for the attacks. Emma Graham-Harrison, senior international affairs correspondent at the Guardian, has tweeted this photo from Kyiv of a child posing on a tank. You can read the Guardian’s full report of Ukraine’s strikes on Russia’s Black Seat Fleet headquarters here: Ukraine has launched a fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters at Sevastopol, where officials in the annexed Crimean peninsula said that at least one drone had been shot down by air defences. The reported attack on Saturday morning – a day after explosions erupted near military bases in Russian-held areas of Ukraine and Russia itself – came amid cautious optimism elsewhere as two more grain ships left a Ukrainian port. The shipments, from Chornomorsk port, brought the total number to leave Ukraine’s Black Sea under a UN-brokered deal to 27. A £65m superyacht of a Russian oligarch hit by sanctions will be auctioned off by the Gibraltar government on Tuesday, becoming the first of the luxury vessels to be sold off since restrictions were imposed on hundreds of rich Russians after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. However, the 72.5-metre Axioma is not being sold for the benefit of the Ukrainian people but for a US investment bank, JP Morgan, which claims the yacht’s billionaire owner, Dmitry Pumpyansky, owes it more than $20m (£17m). The vessel, which features six luxurious guest cabins, a swimming pool, a 3D cinema room, gym, jacuzzi and a fully equipped spa, was detained after docking in Gibraltar in March. Pumpyansky, the owner and chairman of the steel pipe manufacturer OAO TMK, a supplier to the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom, was subjected to sanctions by the UK, EU and the US after the invasion of Ukraine. The UK said the billionaire, who it said had built up an estimated £1.84bn fortune, was one of the oligarchs “closest to Putin”. Robert Neate’s full report is below: Lloyd J. Austin III, US secretary of defense, has tweeted regarding the $775m support package the country is providing for Ukraine. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, has praised the “moving” sight of Ukrainian wheat headed for eastern Africa as part of an operation by the World Food Programme. Ukraine is “trolling” Moscow with a parade of Russian military vehicles in Kyiv on Saturday, reports senior international affairs correspondent Emma Graham-Harrison: Multiple children have reportedly been injured following a Russian strike on a residential building in the Mykolaiv region of Ukraine. One girl’s eye was torn out by shrapnel, according to Nexta, following the attack on the five-story building in Voskresenske. A BBC Ukraine journalist, who tweeted a picture of the damaged building, said four children aged three to 17 were seriously injured and five adults were injured: Olaf Scholz has praised Alexei Navalny on the second anniversary of the jailed Russian opposition politician’s attempted poisoning. The German chancellor also criticised Russia’s clampdown on freedom of speech. “The war that Russia started against Ukraine is a war that also has consequences for Russia,” Scholz said in a video message on Saturday. “Freedom and democracy were already endangered before. But now, freedom of expression is much more endangered and many fear to say their own opinion.” He said it was important to remember Navalny because he was fighting for his belief that “one lives in a democracy and state governed by the rule of law”. The US is planning to buy about 150,000 metric tonnes of grain from Ukraine in the next few weeks for an upcoming shipment of food aid from ports no longer blockaded by war, the World Food Programme chief has told the Associated Press. The Associated Press reports: The final destinations for the grain are not confirmed and discussions continue, David Beasley said. But the planned shipment, one of several the U.N. agency that fights hunger is pursuing, is more than six times the amount of grain that the first WFP-arranged ship from Ukraine is now carrying toward people in the Horn of Africa at risk of starvation. Beasley spoke Friday from northern Kenya, which is deep in a drought that is withering the Horn of Africa region. He sat under a thorn tree among local women who told the AP that the last time it rained was in 2019. Their bone-dry communities face yet another failed rainy season within weeks that could tip parts of the region, especially neighbouring Somalia, into famine. Already, thousands of people have died. The World Food Programme says 22 million people are hungry. “I think there’s a high probability we’ll have a declaration of famine” in the coming weeks, Beasley said. The keenly awaited first aid ship from Ukraine is carrying 23,000 metric tons of grain, enough to feed 1.5 million people on full rations for a month, Beasley said. It is expected to dock in Djibouti on Aug. 26 or 27, and the wheat is supposed to be shipped overland to northern Ethiopia, where millions of people in the Tigray, Afar and Amhara regions have faced not only drought but deadly conflict. Ukraine was the source of half the grain that WFP bought last year to feed 130 million hungry people. Russia and Ukraine signed agreements with the U.N. and the Turkish government last month to enable exports of Ukrainian grain for the first time since Russia’s invasion in February. But the slow reopening of Ukraine’s ports and the cautious movement of cargo ships across the mined Black Sea won’t solve the global food security crisis, Beasley said. He warned that richer countries must do much more to keep grain and other assistance flowing to the hungriest parts of the world, and he named names. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has posted its latest defence intelligence update. In case you missed it last night, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, gave a video address to the nation, vowing that every Russian strike on the country would be answered. Zelenskyy said: All those who experience this constant horror of the destruction of life and the destruction of everything that gives life normality. We will not leave any of these strikes unanswered. We will establish the identity of every occupier who gives orders and executes these strikes at cities. And we will bring them all to justice in one way or another. No murderer will hide. You can listen and read a transcription of the full address here. Ukraine’s defence ministry say that in total they have killed 44,900 Russian personnel, an increase of 200 on the previous day. These figures have not been independently verified by the Guardian. There have been multiple reports of an explosion in Crimea on Saturday morning, with an unmanned aerial vehicle striking the Black Sea fleet’s headquarters in Sevastopol. IZ.RU reports on Telegram that, according to the governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhaev, a drone flew into the roof of the headquarters of the Black Sea fleet, before being shot down over naval headquarters. He posted a picture online, saying nobody was hurt. Razvozhaey added that no one was hurt. Ukraine has not commented on the reported attacks. The Guardian has not independently verified this report. Here is a roundup of what we know as of yesterday regarding the Russia-Ukraine war. Turkey has said that two more ships carrying grain have left Ukraine’s Chornomorsk port, bringing the total number of vessels to leave Ukraine’s Black Sea ports under a UN-brokered grain export deal to 27. Reuters reports: The Zumrut Ana and MV Ocean S, which are authorized to depart on Aug. 20, were loaded with 6,300 tonnes of sunflower oil and 25,000 tonnes of wheat respectively, the joint coordination centre set up to enable safe passage said in a statement. Ukraine’s Sea Ports Authority said on Saturday three Ukrainian seaports had begun loading food onto seven ships, which would deliver 66,500 tonnes of wheat, corn and sunflower oil to consumers. Ukraine’s grain exports have slumped since the start of the war because its Black Sea ports – a vital route for shipments – were closed, driving up global food prices and prompting fears of shortages in Africa and the Middle East. At the end of July, three Black Sea ports were unblocked under a deal between Moscow and Kyiv, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. In its daily intelligence briefing, the UK’s Ministry of Defence says: The last week has seen only minimal changes in territorial control along the frontline. In the Donbas, after small advances from early August, Russian forces have approached the outskirts of the town of Bakhmut, but have not yet broken into the built-up area. Russia has not made any major efforts to advance in the Zaporizhzhia or Kharkiv sectors. In the south-west, neither Ukrainian nor Russian forces have made advances on the Kherson frontline. However, it adds the “increasingly frequent explosions behind Russian lines are probably stressing Russian logistics and air basing in the south”. Russia has reported fresh Ukrainian drone attacks, a day after explosions erupted near military bases in Russian-held areas of Ukraine and in Russia. The latest apparent displays of Kyiv’s growing ability to pummel Moscow’s assets far from frontlines occurred on Friday evening, Reuters reported, and followed huge blasts last week at an air base in Russian-annexed Crimea. In a new assessment, a western official said the earlier explosions had rendered half of Russia’s Black Sea naval aviation force useless. Russia’s RIA and Tass news agencies, citing a local official in Crimea, said it appeared Russian anti-aircraft forces had been in action near the western Crimean port of Yevpatoriya on Friday night. Video posted by a Russian website showed what appeared to be a ground-to-air missile hitting a target. Tass cited a local official as saying Russian anti-aircraft forces knocked down six Ukrainian drones sent to attack the town of Nova Kakhovka, east of the city of Kherson. Ukraine says retaking Kherson is one of its main priorities. Separately, an official in Crimea said defences there had downed an unspecified number of drones over the city of Sevastopol. Vladimir Putin’s agreement to allow independent inspectors to travel to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the French presidency, comes as concerns grow over fighting near the Russian-occupied site. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, “welcomed recent statements indicating that both Ukraine and Russia supported the [International Atomic Energy Agency’s] aim to send a mission to” the plant, Agence France-Presse reported. The Kremlin said after Putin and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke by phone on Friday that the two leaders had agreed that the IAEA should carry out inspections as soon as possible to “assess the real situation on the ground”. A flare-up in fighting around the Russian-controlled nuclear power station – with both sides blaming each other for attacks – has raised the spectre of a disaster worse than in Chernobyl. The Kremlin said Putin stressed that shelling of the plant “creates the danger of a large-scale catastrophe”. The warning came a day after the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, and the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, met in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and sounded the alarm over the fighting. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, urged the UN to secure the site. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. As it approaches 9.30am in Kyiv, here is a summary of the latest developments on this Saturday 20 August 2022. Vladimir Putin has agreed to inspectors visiting the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. According to the office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Russian leader had “reconsidered the demand” that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through Russia to the site, after Putin himself warned fighting there could bring about a “catastrophe”. The office said Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine. The UN secretary general has asked Russia not take the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant off grid. António Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied facility not be cut off from Ukraine’s electrical grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow was planning to do so, saying the plant used “Ukrainian electricity”. Western officials say there are growing concerns over concerns over water cooling at the Zaporizhzhia plant. Its existing reactor cooling system is critical to the safety of the site and relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation, but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from Ukraine’s grid. More than half of Russia Black Sea naval aviation has been knocked out, according to a western official in Ukraine. The Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out “more than half” of Russia’s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea, western officials have said. However, overall “combat stasis” remains. The US has announced a new $775m (£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine, including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. The US has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment. Russia’s media watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest. Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites – including Google – that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of “false information” about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined the US-based live streaming service Twitch 2 million roubles ($34,000) and messenger service Telegram 11 million roubles for violating military censorship laws. A former Russian mayor has been appointed head of Russian-occupied Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. It is the latest in a string of such appointments, which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory. Ukraine’s economy minister has said the country’s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year. Hit by Russia’s 24 February invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022. The Kyiv Independent reported that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on Kharkiv. The Chinese and Russian leaders, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” he said. As hosts of this year’s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled cities since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting around 15km from the Russian frontline, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/04/russia-ukraine-war-morale-and-discipline-problems-hampering-russian-forces-says-uk","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-04T15:00:52Z","webTitle":"Residential areas in Mykolaiv hit, says governor; ‘morale and discipline’ problems in Russian forces, says UK – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/04/russia-ukraine-war-morale-and-discipline-problems-hampering-russian-forces-says-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/04/russia-ukraine-war-morale-and-discipline-problems-hampering-russian-forces-says-uk","fields":{"headline":"Residential areas in Mykolaiv hit, says governor; ‘morale and discipline’ problems in Russian forces, says UK – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 6pm in Kyiv and here’s what’s happened so far today: A fleet of 13 ships carrying more than 280,000 tonnes of grain and agricultural products left ports in Odesa on Sunday, according to Ukraine’s ministry of infrastructure. The ministry said it was the single largest shipment of produce to leave Ukraine since the country brokered an export deal with Russia, the UN and Turkey on 22 July. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has thanked Germany for its solidarity in the face of the Russian invasion and called for more weapons, in a sign of easing tensions between Berlin and Kyiv. He was welcomed by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, with military honours in Berlin. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pushed the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to prepare a fresh package of sanctions, including a ban on issuing visas to Russsian citizens. Humanitarian aid has been blocked from being delivered to the occupied city of Enerhodar, according to its mayor, Dymtro Orlov. He said that trucks with nappies, food and other essentials had been turned back for the second day in a row. Russian forces hit multiple residential targets in Mykolaiv overnight, according to its governor, Vitaliy Kim. He said homes were damaged, as well as three hospitals, two education facilities, a hotel and a museum. Pictures of the damage are coming through already. A video showing Russian multiple-launch rocket systems firing from the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been published by the Insider. The footage, taken overnight on Friday into early Saturday morning, shows the missile launchers close to a power unit. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmygal, is set to visit Germany on Sunday – the first high-level Ukrainian official to visit the country in months. The trip is a sign of eased tensions after a rocky patch between Kyiv and Berlin, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia is using “poverty and political chaos” to attack the lives of all Europeans. In his evening address late on Saturday, president Zelensky said that by stopping the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, Russia wanted to “destroy the normal life of every European.” Russian forces are suffering from “morale and discipline issues” in addition to combat fatigue and high casualties, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Troops’ main grievances probably continued to be around pay, including the high chance that “sizeable combat bonuses” were not being paid, the latest British intelligence update said. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and is relying on a reserve line, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Previously, there had been reports the plant in south-eastern Ukraine had been knocked offline in the early hours of Saturday amid sustained shelling that destroyed a key power line, according to local Russian-backed authorities. Sweden has said it would provide liquidity guarantees to Nordic and Baltic energy companies worth “billions of dollars” in an effort to prevent a financial crisis sparked by Europe’s energy crunch. The Russian energy company Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for them to carry out the work. The European Union expects Russia to respect existing energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so, the economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said. Our political correspondent, Peter Walker, has written about the main challenges facing Liz Truss if she becomes UK prime minister this week. Here’s what he has to say about her likely position on Ukraine: As Johnson’s foreign secretary, and the self-styled continuity-Boris candidate, Truss will maintain his steadfast support for Ukraine’s battle against Russian invaders. One of the few near certainties of Truss’s early weeks in office will be images of her in Kyiv alongside Volodymyr Zelenskiy. But in common with other world leaders, Truss will face difficulties as the war inches forward, with no apparent resolution in sight, especially once the consequences of the energy price crisis, much of it connected to the war, begin to bite. Truss will doubtless stay committed to Ukraine. But as its repercussions are felt, it seems likely she will face more voices, within the Conservative party and more widely, seeking an alternative plan. A fleet of 13 ships carrying more than 280,000 tonnes of grain and agricultural products left ports in Odesa on Sunday, according to Ukraine’s ministry of infrastructure. The ministry said it was the single largest shipment of produce to leave Ukraine since the country brokered an export deal with Russia, the UN and Turkey on 22 July. The grain initiative was signed to try and avert a global crisis and ensure the safe transport of wheat and other essential products, such as sunflower oil. The delivery from ports in Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdenny on Sunday will go to eight countries. So far, 86 ships have left Ukraine to export produce to 19 countries since 1 August, the ministry said. Jennifer Rankin has reported on the latest news from Berlin, where Ukraine’s prime minister has been meeting the German chancellor. Ukraine’s prime minister has thanked Germany for its solidarity in the face of the Russian invasion while calling for more weapons, in a sign of easing tensions between Berlin and Kyiv. Denys Shmyhal, who was welcomed by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, with military honours in Berlin later on Sunday, is the most senior Ukrainian official to visit the German capital in months, since Kyiv accused the EU’s biggest economy of doing too little. Starting his Berlin trip, Shmyhal met the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who was blocked from visiting Kyiv in April because of his past advocacy of strong German-Russian ties. Steinmeier, a former German foreign minister, who conceded in April that his approach to Moscow had been mistaken, offered to travel to Ukraine’s capital in the early weeks of the war to show solidarity but was told his visit was “not desired in Kyiv”. In a tweet after the meeting with Steinmeier, Shmyhal said they had discussed the military situation, strengthening sanctions and the need to provide weapons for Ukraine. “Thanked for solidarity with Ukrainians and support,” the tweet said. “Germany has made huge progress in its support of Ukraine with weapons,” Shmyhal told German media before his trip, according to Agence France-Presse. But the prime minister added that Kyiv needed more from Berlin, including “modern combat tanks” such as the Leopard 2. Humanitarian aid has been blocked from being delivered to the occupied city of Enerhodar, according to its mayor, Dymtro Orlov. Orlov said in a post on Telegram that trucks had been turned back for the second day in a row and that the Russians were doing “everything to block the city from the entire civilised world.” He said the consignment included nappies, hygiene kits and food for vulnerable families. He also posted an image of pallets that appeared to be stacked with nappies, energy biscuits and Unicef branded boxes. Orlov said the delivery also included more than 1,000 square metres of protective fabric for windows blasted out during shelling. He said “the main argument” at the first Russian checkpoint they came to was that “Enerhodar does not need anything, the local residents have everything and even more.” More evidence is emerging of civilian targets hit overnight by Russian missile strikes, this time in Kharkiv. Photographs from the Anadolu agency show the aftermath of a strike on a restaurant complex in the north-eastern city. Only the metal carcass of the building and its furniture remain – along with heaps of burnished cutlery which hint at its past use. AFP has the latest on a key meeting between the Ukrainian prime minister and the German president in Berlin today: Ukraine prime minister Denys Shmyhal brought Kyiv’s plea for more weapons to Germany on Sunday, saying his country needed additional help in its battle against Russia. Shmyhal is the first high-level Ukrainian official to visit Germany in months, in a sign of eased tensions between Kyiv and Berlin after a rocky patch. The first stop on his trip was a meeting with president Frank-Walter Steinmeier, where Shmyhal “discussed the military situation, strengthening sanctions and the need to provide weapons for Ukraine,” he said on Twitter. Shmyhal, who will meet chancellor Olaf Scholz later on Sunday, also thanked Germany “for solidarity with Ukrainians and support”. Germany will “continue to stand reliably by Ukraine’s side,” Steinmeier reassured Shmyhal, according to the German president’s spokeswoman. The Ukrainian prime minister’s visit marked a sharp change in tone, after a row erupted in April when Kyiv rebuffed Steinmeier’s offer to travel to Ukraine. Steinmeier, a former foreign minister from Scholz’s Social Democratic Party, had been shunned over his years-long detente policy towards Moscow - something which he has admitted was a mistake following the outbreak of war. It is 2.20pm in Kyiv and here is a summary of the day so far. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pushed the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to prepare a fresh package of sanctions, including a ban on issuing visas to Russian citizens. Russian forces have hit multiple residential targets in Mykolaiv overnight, according to its governor, Vitaliy Kim.

The European Union expects Russia to respect existing energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so, the economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said. Gazprom’s announcement that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 would not restart came after G7 finance ministers said they planned to implement a price cap on Russian oil to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pushed the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to prepare a fresh package of sanctions. The Ukrainian president has just tweeted that he spoke on the phone to her and discussed financial aid to his country as well as calling for any sanctions to include a ban on issuing visas to Russian citizens. Zelenskiy said they also coordinated steps to limit excessive Russian profit from sales of oil and gas. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Russia is using “poverty and political chaos” to attack the lives of all Europeans. In his evening address late on Saturday, president Zelensky said that by stopping the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, Russia wanted to “destroy the normal life of every European.” Russia’s state energy firm Gazprom said on Saturday that the pipeline could be closed indefinitely. Zelensky said: Russia is trying to increase the energy pressure on Europe even more – gas pumping through the Nord Stream pipeline has completely stopped. Why do they do this? Russia wants to destroy the normal life of every European – in all countries of our continent. It wants to weaken and intimidate the entire Europe, every state. Where Russia cannot do it by force of conventional weapons, it does so by force of energy weapons. It is trying to attack with poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles. And to protect against this, we all in Europe need even more unity, even more coordination, even more help to each other. This winter, Russia is preparing for a decisive energy attack on all Europeans. And the key answers to this should be two things: first, our unity – unity in protection against the terrorist state, and second – Increasing our own pressure on Russia – this includes increasing sanctions at all levels, and limiting Russia’s oil and gas revenues. Images are starting to come in of the damage done by Russian shelling overnight in Mykolaiv, in the south of Ukraine. Reuters photographer, Umit Bektas, has captured the moment medical staff returned to clear up the wreckage of a primary care centre and family clinic in Mykolaiv this morning. Russian forces have hit multiple residential targets in the south central part of Ukraine overnight, according to Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv. Posting on his Telegram account, he said that Russian shelling had damaged homes, three hospitals, two education facilities, a hotel and a museum in the area. Kim said the targets included a private house destroyed by a missile in the village of Vysunsk, Bereznehuvate, where one child is reported to have died and three others have shrapnel injuries. He said the city of Mykolaiv was subjected to “massive rocket fire” overnight from Saturday into this morning, with many municipal buildings damaged and one person reported as injured so far. A video showing Russian multiple-launch rocket systems firing from the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been published by the Insider. The footage, taken overnight on Friday into early Saturday morning, shows the missile launchers close to a power unit. It appears to confirm that Moscow is using the station for offensive military strikes across the Dnipro river, as has previously been alleged by Ukraine. An artist who painted a mural of a Russian and Ukrainian soldier embracing in Melbourne, Australia, has said he will remove it after a backlash. Peter Seaton said the three storey mural was intended as a message of peace but after outcry from Ukrainians, he pledged to paint over it by Monday, according to a report by WA Today Ukraine’s Ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, had said the work was “utterly offensive to all Ukrainians” and called for its removal. The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations’ Stefan Romaniw had compared the painting to a rapist hugging a victim. Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelensky, has just been speaking on the first episode of Laura Kuenssberg’s new Sunday show. She said that all Ukrainians are afraid “but you can’t be so scared as to not do anything. You can’t be passive.” When asked what she would say to British people facing painful choices caused by soaring energy costs, Volodymyr Zelensky’s wife told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “I understand the situation is very tough. But let me recall that at the time of the Covid-19 epidemic, and it’s still with us, when there were price hikes, Ukraine was affected as well. “The prices are going up in Ukraine as well. But in addition our people get killed. So when you start counting pennies on your bank account or in your pocket, we do the same and count our casualties,” she said. China’s top legislator, Li Zhanshu, will attend the seventh Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok this week, the official Xinhua news agency has reported, becoming the most senior Chinese official to visit Russia since the Ukraine war began. Reuters reported that Li, chairman of the National People’s Congress standing committee, will pay official visits to Russia, Mongolia, Nepal and South Korea from Wednesday to 17 September, according to Xinhua. He would attend the four-day forum – set to begin on Monday – during his stay in Russia, it said on Sunday. Li, who is ranked No. 3 in the Chinese Communist party, is due to retire from his party position at a party congress next month, but will keep his parliamentary position until March. China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin announced a “no limit” strategic partnership in February, weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine’s armed forces have given their latest official estimate of Russian losses in the war so far. They say 49,500 Russian troops have lost their lives since February but these figures are not possible to verify. The Kyiv Independent has made a useful graphic here. Ukrainian Evgeniy Maloletka has won the Visa d’Or, one of photojournalism’s most prestigious prizes, for his work during the Russian siege of Mariupol. Maloletka, 35, was visibly moved as he dedicated his prize to the Ukrainian people at a ceremony in Perpignan in southern France on Saturday, Agence France-Presse reported. Maloletka works for Associated Press and was among the first journalists to enter Mariupol on 23 February, an hour before the first Russian bombs fell. He was also one of the last to leave, on 15 March, by which time the southern Ukrainian city been almost entirely destroyed by Russian shelling. Those 20 days he spent there were like one long, unending day, “becoming worse and worse”, he said. His pictures showed the full horrors of the conflict and the Russian bombardment: children killed during the siege, heavily pregnant women lying among the ruins of bombed-out buildings, hastily improvised common graves. The other two photographers nominated were Daniel Berehulak, an Australian of Ukrainian origin, and Marcus Yam. The war in Ukraine has been a dominant theme at the International Festival of Photojournalism, which opened on 27 August. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmygal, is set to visit Germany on Sunday – the first high-level Ukrainian official to visit the country in months. The trip is a sign of eased tensions after a rocky patch between Kyiv and Berlin, Agence France-Presse reports. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has repeatedly vowed Germany’s strong support for Ukraine in its battle against Russia’s invasion. But in the immediate weeks after Russian troops marched on Ukraine, Kyiv criticised German aid as too little and too late. A visit by Scholz to Kyiv in June and the arrival of weapons from Germany have since led to a change in tone. Shmygal told German media ahead of his trip, in a transcript published by his press office: Germany has made huge progress in its support of Ukraine with weapons. But the prime minister said Kyiv needed more from Berlin, including “modern combat tanks” such as the Leopard 2. Scholz is to welcome Shmygal with military honours in the Sunday afternoon. Shmygal will to start his day with talks in the morning with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose offer to travel to Kyiv in April was rebuffed, sparking a row. Russian forces are suffering from “morale and discipline issues” in addition to combat fatigue and high casualties, the UK Ministry of Defence says. A main grievance from troops probably continued to be around pay, including the high chance that “sizeable combat bonuses” were not being paid, the latest British intelligence update said. At least some “outright corruption” among commanders was probably involved, as well as an “inefficient military bureaucracy”, it said. The Russian military has consistently failed to provide basic entitlements to troops deployed in Ukraine, including appropriate uniform, arms and rations as well as pay. This has almost certainly contributed to the continued fragile morale of much of the force. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s ongoing live coverage of the war in Ukraine, now it its 193rd day. Here are latest developments as it passes 9.30am in Kyiv. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and is relying on a reserve line, the International Atomic Energy Agency said.

Gazprom’s announcement that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 would not restart came after G7 finance ministers said they planned to implement a price cap on Russian oil to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression”. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told Vladimir Putin that his country can play a facilitator role regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, according to his office. An eight-year-old child has died after Russian shelling in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv on Sunday morning, according to the head of the regional council, Hanna Zamazeyeva. Two other children were among those injured in Russian shelling in the city of Mykolaiv and Bereznehuvate, she said in an update on Telegram. Russian troops launched overnight rocket attacks on Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine, according to the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko. The leader of Chechnya has reportedly said he plans to take an “indefinite and long” break from his post. In a video posted to his Telegram, Ramzan Kadyrov, 45, reportedly said he believed the “time has come” for him to leave. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has accused the west of playing a “chess game with death” in its support of Ukraine and accused western countries of trying to take advantage of the conflict to push Russia to “a new round of disintegration”. Ukrainian forces have “likely achieved a degree of tactical surprise” with the ongoing counter-offensive, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its daily intelligence briefing, it said Ukraine had done so by taking advantage of “poor logistics, administration and leadership” in Russia’s military. Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has said in a BBC interview that while the economic impact of the war in Ukraine is tough on its allies, Britons “count pennies” while Ukrainians “count casualties”. Russians paid their final respects to Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, in a ceremony held in Moscow without much fanfare and with President Vladimir Putin notably absent.

The vivid aerial photographs show charred remains of combat aircraft amid large areas of scorched earth, as evidence of the attack that took place on Tuesday afternoon more than 110 miles from the frontline. Ukraine’s air force said at least nine Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground at the airbase. Russia has said the attack killed one person, wounded 14 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Independent analysts at Oryx Research said at least 11 Russian jets – four Su-30SMs and seven Su-24s – were destroyed, based on analysis of the imagery released by satellite companies and Ukraine’s air force. Kyiv has not publicly claimed responsibility for the attack – although it is doing so in private – while an adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, suggested partisans operating behind Russian lines might have been involved. But the country’s defence ministry tweeted out a video revelling in the attack and telling Russian tourists it was not safe to holiday in Crimea. “No amount of sunscreen will protect them from the hazardous effects of smoking in unauthorised areas,” the ministry said, a standard phrase when referring to attacks for which Ukraine does not want to formally take responsibility. Oleh Zhdanov, an independent Ukrainian military analyst, said: “Official Kyiv has kept mum about it, but unofficially the military acknowledges that it was a Ukrainian strike.” Zelenskiy referred to the attack in his Wednesday evening address. “In just one day, the occupiers lost 10 combat aircraft: nine in Crimea and one more in the direction of Zaporizhzhia,” he said. “The occupiers also suffer new losses of armoured vehicles, warehouses with ammunition, logistics routes.” Russia has sought to downplay the attack, denying that any aircraft were damaged in the blasts and conceding only that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area at the base, one of a number used to launch air and missile attacks against Ukraine and patrol the Black Sea. Images taken by the private satellite operator Planet Labs at about 8am on 9 August – approximately four hours before the attack – and about 4.40pm on 10 August show aircraft parked outside were damaged or destroyed. The before-and-after images are the first independent confirmation of damage to the base. But it remains unclear how the attack took place. Eliot Higgins, the founder and director of the open-source investigative website Bellingcat, said in a series of tweets he “can’t think of a time Russia has lost this many air assets in one day in recent memory”. Higgins said he could make out three craters at what appeared to be storage sites. “One way to interpret those craters is precise strikes from a long-range munition,” he said, adding that the craters appeared to measure “about 20-25m wide … which would mean a pretty big munition”. Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, cryptically said the blasts were either caused by Ukrainian-made long-range weapons or the work of Ukrainian guerrillas operating in Crimea. Other analysts have said they cannot find any evidence for a missile strike in the videos of the incident, suggesting it was the work of special forces or guerrilla operators. The scale of the damage is likely to mean Russian official estimates of the number of casualties are an underestimate. As well as the dead and wounded, officials said 62 housing blocks had been damaged. In the last few days there have been a growing number of attacks and explosions at Russian bases behind enemy lines. Late on Wednesday a number of blasts were heard at an airstrip used by Russian forces in south-east Belarus. The Belarus state news agency said there were no casualties and “personnel took prompt extinguishing measures”. However, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, hinted at responsibility. “The epidemic of technical accidents at military airfields of Crimea and Belarus should be considered by [Russian] military as a warning: forget about Ukraine, take off the uniform and leave.” Elsewhere on Thursday, Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said Britain would send three more M270 rocket artillery systems to Ukraine, at an international weapons donor conference held in Copenhagen, Denmark. “President Putin will have gambled that come August, come a few months in, we will have all got bored of the conflict and the international community would have gone off in different directions. Well, today is proof of the opposite,” Wallace said. Denmark said the 26 participating countries had agreed to send €1.5bn worth of weapons, and the host said it would donate $113m worth of kit to help Kyiv in the nearly six-month-old war with Russia. The Ukrainian state energy company Energoatom said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was shelled five times by Russian forces on Thursday, including near the site where radioactive materials are stored. But it said nobody was injured and the situation at the plant remained under control. Earlier in the day, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass said Ukraine had shelled the plant for a second time on Thursday, citing the Russian-installed local administration. But the claim could not be verified. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, told the UN security council on Thursday that explosions at the Zaporizhzhia plant had cut some of the external electricity supply to the site, essential for the cooling systems in the reactor. One of the reactors had shut down as a result and emergency diesel generators had been turned on, he said. Grossi said his agency assessed there was no immediate threat to nuclear safety but “this could change at any moment”. He appealed for a team of IAEA inspectors to be allowed access to the nuclear power plant to assess its safety."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/03/russia-ukraine-war-european-commission-rejects-russias-fallacious-reason-for-shutting-nord-stream-gas-pipeline","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-03T18:20:17Z","webTitle":"Zaporizhzhia plant again loses last main power line; public bids farewell to Gorbachev at funeral – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/03/russia-ukraine-war-european-commission-rejects-russias-fallacious-reason-for-shutting-nord-stream-gas-pipeline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/03/russia-ukraine-war-european-commission-rejects-russias-fallacious-reason-for-shutting-nord-stream-gas-pipeline","fields":{"headline":"Zaporizhzhia plant again loses last main power line; public bids farewell to Gorbachev at funeral – as it happened","bodyText":"Here is a round-up of events today: Sweden has said it would provide liquidity guarantees to Nordic and Baltic energy companies worth “billions of dollars” in an effort to prevent a financial crisis sparked by Europe’s energy crunch, The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and is now relying on a reserve line, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement. Previously, there had been reports that it had been knocked offline in the early hours of Saturday amid sustained shelling that destroyed a key power line, according to local Russian-backed authorities. The Russian energy major Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for them to carry out the work.

Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, travelled to Moscow to pay his respects. Sweden said it would provide liquidity guarantees to Nordic and Baltic energy companies worth “billions of dollars” in an effort to prevent a financial crisis sparked by Europe’s energy crunch, Agence France-Presse reports. The prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, warned that Sweden was facing the prospect of a “war winter”. Andersson said at a press conference in Stockholm that the guarantees were aimed at giving energy groups “the breathing room that is needed” and that there was “a clear security policy agenda behind Russia’s actions”. The exact details of the guarantees, she said, have yet to be worked out. Andersson added: Russia’s energy war is having serious consequences for Europe and Swedish households and companies, especially in southern Sweden which is dependent on electricity prices in Germany, which in turn is very dependent on gas. This threatens our financial stability. If we don’t act soon it could lead to serious disruptions in the Nordics and Baltics. In the worst-case scenario we could fall into a financial crisis.” Finance minister Mikael Damberg said the Swedish decision would “secure financial stability not only in Sweden but in the entire Nordic region”. The guarantees were expected to be in place on Monday and would cover the Nordic and Baltic regions within the next two weeks. Sweden’s parliament has been called in from its summer break to hold a vote on the government’s proposal on Monday. The global atomic energy watchdog has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and is now relying on a reserve line. Agence France-Presse reports: Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has once again lost the connection to its last remaining main external power line, but the facility is continuing to supply electricity to the grid through a reserve line, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was informed at the site today,” the agency said in a statement. Less than 48 hours after Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi on Thursday established the presence of the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to ZaporizhzhIa (ISAMZ) at the facility in southern Ukraine, the Agency’s experts were told by senior Ukrainian staff that the ZNPP’s fourth operational 750 Kilovolt (kV) power line was down. The three others were lost earlier during the conflict.” Here is a report from my colleague Andrew Roth: The Pillar Hall in the House of the Unions is a grand old ballroom where Soviet leaders are put on display when they die. Nearly a century ago, the body of Vladimir Lenin lay in state for three days before his funeral. Stalin and Brezhnev followed. Now Mikhail Gorbachev is here, pale in a spotlit coffin: the last Soviet leader finally being laid to rest. Vladimir Putin is not here, a snub that the Kremlin has said was a result of his busy work schedule. Yet thousands of Russians have come to pay their respects, lining up past the downtown theatres and trendy cafes, each person a reminder that Mikhail Gorbachev still remains a hero to some. “He did a lot, but people now in our country hate him,” Vladimir Gubarev, a retired journalist who lined up on Saturday morning bearing a few carnations, told the Observer. “People want to be happy fast. Immediately. The way of Gorbachev was the slow way to freedom, to real freedom. And he didn’t have enough time.” For many, coming to the hall was both an act of appreciation and one of defiance to honour the memory of a leader who brought new freedoms and hastened the collapse of his own country. “He was a great man, so immediately after his death, people say good words about him,” said Gubarev. “But only after he is gone. Because while he was alive, he was dangerous. He was the enemy.” You can read the full report here. Gorbachev’s funeral took place without state honours or the presence of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Reuters reports that the man “affectionately known as ‘Gorby’ in the West and who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 for his role in ending the Cold War” was buried at Moscow’s famous Novodevichy cemetery alongside his wife Raisa, who died in 1999. Best known in the West for helping end the Cold War, reducing his country’s nuclear stockpile, and for unwittingly presiding over the demise of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev’s legacy still divides opinion inside and outside Russia. But those who lined up to say farewell recalled the late politician, who died in Moscow after an unspecified illness, with gratitude. He was a peacemaker, he was one of God’s sons,” said Tatiana, 80, who said she had come despite poor health. Tycoon and close friend Alexander Lebedev said: “He wanted to give us democracy and freedom and we turned out to not be very ready yet. “That’s most unfortunate but we will still be a European country. This part of history will be over one day.” Here are some images from the funeral today of the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev who died on Tuesday aged 91. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The Russian energy major Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for them to carry out the work. Gazprom, the state-owned oil and gas firm, extended the shutdown of gas flows through its key Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany on Friday evening, citing “malfunctions” on a key turbine along the pipeline. The EU expects Russia to respect existing energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so, the economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said. Gentiloni was speaking after Russia scrapped a Saturday deadline to resume flows of an important gas supply route to Germany, deepening Europe’s difficulties in securing winter fuel. Gazprom’s announcement that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 would not restart came after the decision by G7 finance ministers that they plan to implement a price cap on Russian oil. In a statement, the ministers said the cap was designed to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression” and that they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure, but left out key details of the plan. The Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine was once again knocked offline in the early hours of Saturday, local Russian-backed authorities said. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Kremlin-appointed regional administration, claimed sustained shelling destroyed a key power line and penetrated deep into the plant’s premises. His claims could not be immediately verified. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told Vladimir Putin that his country can play a facilitator role regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, according to his office. The pair spoke in a phone call where they also discussed developments regarding Ukrainian grain exports, the Turkish presidency said in a statement. An eight-year-old child has died after Russian shelling in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv this morning, according to the head of the regional council, Hanna Zamazeyeva. Two other children were among those injured in Russian shelling in the city of Mykolaiv and Bereznehuvate, she said in an update on Telegram.

In a video posted to his Telegram, Kadyrov, 45, reportedly said he believed the “time has come” for him to leave. Kadyrov has ruled Russia’s Chechnya republic with an iron fist since 2007. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has accused the west of playing a “chess game with death” in its support of Ukraine. Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, accused western countries of trying to take advantage of the conflict to push Russia to “a new round of disintegration”. Ukrainian forces have “likely achieved a degree of tactical surprise” with the ongoing counter-offensive, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said.

Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has said that while the economic impact of the war in Ukraine is tough on its allies, Britons “count pennies” while Ukrainians “count casualties”. In an interview with the BBC due to be broadcast on Sunday, Zelenska said if support for Ukraine was strong the crisis would be shorter. Russians paid their final respects to the last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, in a ceremony held in Moscow without much fanfare and with President Vladimir Putin notably absent. Several thousand mourners queued up to quietly file past Gorbachev’s open casket that was flanked by honour guards under the Russian flag in the historic Hall of Columns. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, travelled to Moscow to pay his respects. Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, has reportedly said he plans to take an “indefinite and long” break from his post. Kadyrov, who has ruled Russia’s Chechnya republic with an iron fist since 2007, was in March promoted to lieutenant-general by Vladimir Putin for his role in the invasion of Ukraine. In a video posted to his Telegram, Kadyrov, 45, reportedly says he believes the “time has come” for him to leave. Kadyrov said: I realised that I have been sitting in my position for a long time. I think my time has come [to leave power]. The BBC’s Sarah Rainsford shared the video, writing: Is Kadyrov resigning or is this some weird Kadyrovism? Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has said that while the economic impact of the war in Ukraine is tough on its allies, Britons “count pennies” while Ukrainians “count casualties”. In an interview with the BBC, Zelenska said if support for Ukraine was strong the crisis would be shorter. The wife of Volodymyr Zelenskiy was asked what message she had for people in the UK who are facing soaring energy bills in part due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Zelenska said: I understand the situation is very tough. But let me recall that at the time of the Covid-19 epidemic, and it’s still with us, when there were price hikes, Ukraine was affected as well. The prices are going up in Ukraine as well. But in addition our people get killed. So when you start counting pennies on your bank account or in your pocket, we do the same and count our casualties. During the interview, which will be broadcast tomorrow, she said it was difficult for people outside Ukraine to understand the impact of the war on its people. It was, therefore, important to keep highlighting the human toll of the war, she said. She added: That’s why we have to tell these stories, to show these stories, because these are the faces of a war. Not a number of bombs dropped, not the amount of money spent, human stories - and there are a thousand stories like that around. An eight-year-old child has died after Russian shelling in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv this morning, according to the head of the regional council, Hanna Zamazeyeva. Two other children were among those injured in Russian shelling in the city of Mykolaiv and Bereznehuvate, she said in an update on Telegram. Zamazeyeva said: Today’s morning was especially difficult. Shelling continues. Unfortunately, there are victims. There are two wounded in the city of Mykolaiv, four in Bereznehuvate. Among those injured are two children. Unfortunately, an 8-year-old child [was killed]. She added: In addition to artillery shelling, air strikes on populated areas in the Pervomaiske, Shyroke and Bereznehuvate communities were recorded. Residential buildings and outbuildings were damaged. Fires broke out as a result of shelling. It has not been possible to independently verify this information. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said he has spoken with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, following a long-awaited visit by UN nuclear inspectors to the Zaporizhzhia plant in Ukraine. Michel paid tribute to the UN nuclear agency’s “courage and professionalism”, describing the 14-strong team’s mission to the Russian-occupied nuclear plant as “impressive”. The EU “fully supports” the IAEA’s work and efforts, he added. the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has accused the west of playing a “chess game with death” in its support for Ukraine. In a post on Vkontake, Russia’s largest social network, Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, accused western countries of trying to take advantage of the conflict to push Russia to “a new round of disintegration”. “To do everything so that the state institutions of Russia stop working,” he said. “To deprive the country of effective governance, as it was back in 1991. And, as a result, eliminate Russia from the political field.” He added that the “such attempts are really extremely dangerous” because they “ignore a simple axiom: the violent disintegration of a nuclear power is always a chess game with death”. He also described Russia’s nuclear arsenal as “the best guarantee of the preservation of Great Russia”. At least one woman has been injured in a strike on the southern city of Mykolaiv, the city’s mayor has said. Posting on Telegram, Oleksandr Senkevych said explosions were heard in the city at around 11:30am local time and that a garage had been struck. He said rescuers were working to extinguish a fire at the site and that the shockwave had also blown out the windows and doors of a nearby private residential building. One woman received shrapnel injuries, he said. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that his country can play a facilitator role regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, according to his office. The pair spoke in a phone call where they discussed developments regarding Ukrainian grain exports, the Turkish presidency said in a statement. They also expressed their determination to continue the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear plant in Turkey according to plans. They agreed to discuss the issues in detail when they meet in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, for a summit later this month, the office added. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has travelled to Moscow to pay his respects at the funeral of former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. There were no plans for Orbán to meet with Vladimir Putin during his trip to Moscow, Russian media reported, citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Peskov told Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti: As far as we know, he will only fly in to say goodbye to Gorbachev. There were no desires for meetings. Vladimir Putin is waging economic and psychological war by closing a major gas pipeline to Europe, a former energy industry boss has said. The decision by the Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom to extend the shutdown of gas flows through its Nord Stream 1 pipeline has left Britain “panicking”, according to Angela Knight, former chief executive of trade association Energy UK. Speaking to Times Radio today, Knight said the UK and Europe had become energy dependent on countries that were “not all that friendly”. She said: He’s (Putin) actually playing the economic war extremely well. He’s playing the psychological war extremely well. We have been panicking as a country - Europe has been panicking as well - and it’s not surprising and I’m not critical of it. Britain’s energy policy has been “wrong for a long, long time”, she added. “It’s a really nasty shock that we’ve had.” The European commissioner for the economy, Paolo Gentiloni, said the EU expects Russia to respect energy contracts it has agreed but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so. Asked about the halt to the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, Gentiloni pointed to high gas storage levels and said there were plans to conserve energy in the winter. He said: We expect Russia to respect the contracts that they have. But even if weaponisation of energy continues or increases, the EU is ready to react. Mykhailo Podolyak, a key Ukrainian presidential adviser, has said Kyiv will determine the end of the war when it has finished “liberating its territories” and demanding Russia pay reparations. Podolyak wrote on Twitter: [Russian Federation] officials repeat weird mantra: “Special military operation will be completed on time”, “The West delays its completion”. It looks like they did not understand anything. Ukraine will determine the ending war term by liberating its territories. As well as reparations payments amount. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, earlier this week extended his “special military operation” and reportedly ordered his troops to capture the Donetsk region by 15 September, rather than the original 31 August deadline. The Russian energy major Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for them to carry out the work. Gazprom, the state-owned oil and gas firm, extended the shutdown of gas flows through its key Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany on Friday evening, citing “malfunctions” on a key turbine along the pipeline. It said the pipeline would not restart until repairs were fully implemented, without providing a timeframe for a reopening. In a statement today, Gazprom said Siemens Energy was taking part in repair work in accordance with an existing contract between the two companies and was ready to fix faults which Gazprom said had forced it to halt gas supply to Germany through the pipeline. Russian troops launched overnight rocket attacks on Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine, according to the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko. In an update posted to his Telegram account, Kyrylenko said: In Kramatorsk, a rocket hit a food enterprise, injuring a person. Another one hit a light industry enterprise. A fire broke out there. Russian forces also struck two enterprises in Sloviansk, damaging several houses, Kyrylenko added. Vadym Liakh, the mayor of Sloviansk, confirmed the city was under attack, writing on Facebook: The city was shelled again. There were loud explosions on the outskirts. In Bylbasivka, private houses were damaged on Shkilna and Yaseneva Streets. My colleague Andrew Roth is covering the farewell ceremony of Mikhail Gorbachev, which is being held in the Hall of Pillars in Moscow’s House of the Unions today. The funeral of Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, will take place today without state honours or the presence of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Mourners began queuing up near the Kremlin this morning to pay their last respects to Gorbachev, who died on Tuesday aged 91. Gorbachev is the first Russian leader since Nikita Khrushchev not to receive an official state funeral in what has been widely seen as a snub by the Russian president. He was, however, granted a public send-off, with authorities allowing Russians to view his coffin in the Hall of Columns, where previous Soviet leaders have been mourned. The farewell ceremony will be followed by a closed funeral in the Novodevichy cemetery. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said schedule constraints meant Putin would not attend a public farewell ceremony at Moscow’s House of Unions, or the funeral at Novodevichy cemetery today. Putin did pay his respects to the Soviet leader on Thursday morning, leaving flowers by Gorbachev’s coffin at the mourning hall of Moscow’s Central Clinical hospital. Russia has expressed “alarm” to the UN’s secretary general that the US has yet to issue visas for its delegation to attend a session of the general assembly later this month, according to a letter seen by Agence France-Presse. “None of the 56 Russian representatives from the main team and advance group have received entry visas to the United States” as of Thursday, Russian ambassador Vasily Nebenzia wrote in a letter addressed to the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres. Nebenzia added that a “similar situation exists with the accompanying journalists and crew members” on the flight of the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov is set to lead Russia’s delegation to the UN general assembly from 20-26 September. Nebenzia added: This is even more alarming since for the last several months the authorities of the United States have been constantly refusing to grant entry visas to a number of Russian delegates assigned to take part in the official United Nations events. Russia’s halting of gas deliveries to Germany via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for an indefinite period is set to worsen Europe’s energy crisis. The Russian-owned gas giant Gazprom said on Friday that the pipeline, which was due to reopen on Saturday, would remain shut until a turbine was repaired. Gazprom indicated it had discovered “oil leaks” in a turbine while carrying out maintenance with representatives of Siemens, which manufactured the turbine, and published a picture on Telegram of cables covered in a brown liquid. Earlier, the Kremlin warned the future operation of the Nord Stream pipeline – the biggest pipeline for gas from Russia to Europe – was at risk due to a lack of spare parts. The turbine-maker Siemens Energy said in a statement that the oil leaks blamed by Gazprom was “not a technical reason for stopping operation”, adding that it was “not contracted for maintenance work. Such leakages do not usually affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site. Following the imposition of sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has reduced or halted gas supplies to different European nations, causing energy prices to soar. The Kremlin has blamed the sanctions for the reduced supplies. As winter approaches, European nations have been seeking to completely fill their gas reserves, secure alternative supplies and put into place plans to reduce consumption. The Russian energy major Gazprom extended the shutdown of gas flows through its key Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany on Friday evening, providing no timeframe for a reopening. The move came hours after G7 countries agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil in an attempt to stem the flow of funds to Vladimir Putin’s regime. Gazprom, the state-owned oil and gas firm, said supplies would remain halted indefinitely after a leak was detected. It said the pipeline would not restart until repairs were fully implemented. Nord Stream 1 is the single biggest pipeline for gas from Russia to Europe and has the capacity to deliver 55bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year. Continued supplies through the pipeline are seen as crucial to prevent a deepening of the energy crisis. In a statement on Telegram, Gazprom said: Gas transportation to the Nord Stream gas pipeline has been completely halted until the complaints on the operation of the equipment have been eliminated. It said in the social media post it had identified “malfunctions” on a key turbine along the pipeline, which carries natural gas from western Russia to Germany, and that the pipeline would not work unless these were eliminated. Early on Wednesday, Gazprom completely halted the flow of gas through Nord Stream 1, in line with an earlier announcement, adding that the stoppage would last for three days. Flows were due to resume just after midnight on Saturday morning. Read the full article by Alex Lawson here. Ukrainian forces have “likely achieved a degree of tactical surprise” with the ongoing counter-offensive, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its daily intelligence briefing, it said it had done so by taking advantage of “poor logistics, administration and leadership” in Russia’s military. It said: Since 29 August 2022, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been conducting renewed offensive operations in the south of Ukraine. One element of this offensive is an ongoing advance on a broad front west of the Dnipro River, focusing on three axes within Russian-occupied Kherson Oblast. The operation has limited immediate objectives, but Ukraine’s forces have likely achieved a degree of tactical surprise; exploiting poor logistics, administration and leadership in the Russian armed forces. With fighting also continuing in the Donbas and Kharkiv sectors, a key decision for Russian commanders in coming days will be where to commit any operational reserve force they can generate. Ukraine’s military said it had carried out strikes against Russian positions in the region around the southern town of Enerhodar on Friday, near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant where UN experts are working. Reuters reports that the revelation by the armed forces’ general staff was unusual because the military rarely gives details of specific targets. The staff said in a Facebook post: It has been confirmed that in the region around the towns of Kherson and Enerhodar, precise strikes by our armed forces destroyed three enemy artillery systems as well as a warehouse with ammunition and up to a company of soldiers. It did not give more details about the strikes. A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency is gathering data at the Zaporizhzhia station, on the edge of Russian-occupied Enerhoda, which is about 300km (185 miles) from Kherson. Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shelling the nuclear plant, while Kyiv says pro-Moscow forces are responsible for attacking it. The Russian energy company Gazprom announced that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 would not restart on schedule on Saturday, citing turbine damage. Gazprom’s CEO, Alexei Miller, indicated Siemens could not carry out repairs because of sanctions. The European Commission chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, said Gazprom was staging the shutdown “under fallacious pretences”. The shutdown of the single biggest pipeline for gas from Russia to Europe will stoke concerns over the reliability of winter energy supplies. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, who returned from a first visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, said six of the team’s experts remained at the site to continue the work. He told reporters the mission would produce a report early next week of its findings. Grossi said military operations were increasing in the region of the plant, “which worries me a lot”. He said the military presence was not available when he asked to speak to them about the control centre, they did not approach his team and they were “withdrawn” throughout their visit to the Russian-controlled facility in south-eastern Ukraine . Finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) nations have announced they plan to implement a price cap on Russian oil. In a statement, the ministers said the cap was designed to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression” and that they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure, but left out key details of the plan. Prior to the G7 announcement, the Kremlin said imposing the price cap would trigger Russian retaliation. If G7 leaders went ahead it would lead to significant destabilisation of the global oil market, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Ukraine’s military has claimed that Russian forces suffered “significant losses” in the southern region of Kherson following Kyiv’s counteroffensive launched earlier this week. Ukraine’s successes have been “quite convincing”, according to a spokesperson for the southern Ukrainian military command, who added that more “positive news” would likely follow “very soon”. Ukrainian troops have pushed back Russian forces at several points around Kherson, according to western officials. Officials estimate that about 20,000 Russian troops are in the pocket of the southern region, and caution that it is too soon to determine if Ukraine’s counterattack is working. The “physical integrity” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been “violated several times”, Rafael Grossi said. The IAEA chief said after leading the inspection team that while he would continue to worry about the plant, the situation was “more predictable” now. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of manipulating and distorting information shared with the IAEA. Ukrainian state-owned operator Energoatom said Russian officials “are making every effort to prevent the IAEA mission from getting to know the real state of affairs. They spread manipulative and false information about this visit.” The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has accused Ukraine of “nuclear terrorism”. Pro-Russian proxy authorities in Zaporizhzhia have accused Kyiv of trying to smuggle “spies” into the IAEA inspection team posing as journalists. The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin, has restated the expansionist military aims of Russia’s invasion. “Our task is to liberate all Russian cities that were founded by Russian people during the time of the Russian Empire, and developed during the Soviet Union thanks to the help of our entire vast country,” Pushilin said. “This is not only the territories of Novorossia [the Donbas], but also much wider. It will not be any other way.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

The UK’s main trade union body is calling on the government to set up a “public energy champion” that could own low-carbon energy projects from wind and solar to tidal and nuclear power. In a new analysis seen by the Guardian, the TUC estimates that the government could use excess profits made by this public company to cut bills and insulate homes, improving their energy efficiency. The TUC argues that if the UK had a state-backed energy generation company akin to France’s EDF, EnBW in Germany or Sweden’s Vattenfall, it would receive between £63bn and £122bn in revenues over the next two years. That is equivalent to between £2,250 and £4,400 a household. The government has attempted to retrospectively take a cut from the unexpected gains made by energy producers this year. In May the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak, introduced a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers. However, Liz Truss has resisted calls for a similar levy on low-carbon electricity generators, which have benefited from the surge in the price of gas. Instead, her government is attempting to negotiate new contracts with operators. The TUC study argues that having a fully privatised energy generation market has left Britons with higher bills and created a dependence on foreign technology, investment and skills. Its general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Privatisation has led to higher bills and colder homes. We need a fairer, greener approach that stops energy companies using UK families like cash machines. “French, Swedish and German families benefit from public ownership of electricity – why shouldn’t we? If we set up our own UK public energy champion, we can have lower bills, free home improvements to reduce our energy needs, and a safer climate for future generations.” The TUC research argues that public ownership of generation firms has allowed European nations to keep down prices, reinvest in communities and deliver on industrial strategy. However, critics may point to the nearly €10bn sum the French government has had to pay to fully nationalise debt-laden EDF. The study builds on a TUC proposal announced in July to nationalise five of the biggest energy companies to bring down bills. It estimated it would cost £2.85bn to nationalise the big five supply firms – British Gas, E.ON, EDF, Scottish Power and Ovo. Some forecasts estimate the government could spend more than £4bn bailing out Bulb, which collapsed last year. The TUC proposals were backed by the Green party. The party’s co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: “It’s important there’s more government ownership across all parts of the energy market so that we can ensure a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewables and secure our energy needs for the future. “We do also need to support a diverse range of ownership models for energy generators and suppliers including local community, cooperatives and municipal that are close to the people they serve and can innovate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/03/russia-has-no-full-control-of-any-of-four-annexed-ukrainian-provinces","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-04T08:53:10Z","webTitle":"Russia no longer has full control of any of four ‘annexed’ Ukrainian provinces","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/03/russia-has-no-full-control-of-any-of-four-annexed-ukrainian-provinces","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/03/russia-has-no-full-control-of-any-of-four-annexed-ukrainian-provinces","fields":{"headline":"Russia no longer has full control of any of four ‘annexed’ Ukrainian provinces","bodyText":"Russia no longer has full control of any of the four provinces of Ukraine it says it annexed last week after Ukrainian troops advanced dozens of kilometres in Kherson province in the south of the country and made additional gains in the east. On Monday, the Russian military acknowledged that Kyiv’s forces had broken through in the Kherson region. It said the Ukrainian army and its “superior tank units” had managed to “penetrate the depths of our defence” around the villages of Zoltaya Balka and Alexsandrovka. The ministry of defence spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Russian troops had occupied what he called a “pre-prepared defensive line”. They continued to “inflict massive fire damage” on Ukrainian forces, he claimed. His comments are an admission that Ukraine’s southern counter-offensive is dramatically gaining pace, two months after it began. Ukrainian brigades appear to have achieved their biggest breakthrough in the region since the war started, bursting through the frontline and advancing rapidly along the Dnieper River. The Ukrainian military’s southern command said forces in the south destroyed 31 Russian tanks and one multiple rocket launcher, without providing details of where the fighting occurred. Russian sources acknowledged that the Ukrainian tank offensive had moved along the river’s west bank, recapturing a number of villages along the way, and threatening the supply lines for thousands of marooned Russian troops. Speaking overnight, Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s 129th brigade from his home city of Kryvyi Rih had liberated the settlements of Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka in the northern Kherson region. The brigade’s soldiers flew a blue and yellow flag in Myrolyubivka from a shell-damaged roof. Russian military bloggers suggested Ukraine’s advance was spectacular. They claimed Kyiv’s troops were close to Dudchany, about 20 miles (30km) south of where the front stood before the breakthrough, indicating one of the fastest advances of the war. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, posted a photo of Ukrainian soldiers posing with their flag draping a golden statue of an angel. He said it was the village of Mikhailivka, about 20km beyond their previous position. The next apparent Ukrainian target was the city of Beryslav, on the banks of the Dnieper. In a sign of turbulence inside Russia’s army command, the head of the western military district was reportedly sacked on Monday in the wake of the recent defeats. The news outlet RBC said Col-Gen Alexander Zhuravlyov had been fired. His district is one of five that make up Russia’s armed forces. The move follows criticism over the weekend by Chechnya’s president, Ramzan Kadyrov, of Valery Gerasimov, Putin’s chief of the general staff, over the loss of Lyman. “This is obviously related to the war blunders, which are becoming harder to hide. The Kremlin is looking for scapegoats,” said a former Russian defence ministry official who has worked with Zhuravlyov. “The pressure on the commander of the Russian armed forces, Valery Gerasimov, will only increase,” the former defence ministry official added. In his latest address, Zelenskiy dismissed as a “farce” Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory, which includes Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk provinces. Declining to mention Vladimir Putin by name, he said “someone somewhere” had recently held what he called “pseudo-referendums”. “When the Ukrainian flag is returned, no one remembers the Russian farce with some pieces of paper,” Zelenskiy said. “Except, of course, the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine. Because everyone who is involved in any elements of aggression against our state will be accountable for it.” On Friday, Putin held a grand signing ceremony in the Kremlin with the four Russian-picked “leaders” of the occupied Ukrainian regions. He declared the territories were Russia’s “for ever” and said he would use “all available means” to defend them – an apparent reference to nuclear weapons. The Russian State Duma – the lower house of parliament – rubber-stamped the move on Monday. But the Kremlin’s strategy quickly unravelled in the face of embarrassing defeats on the battlefield and confusion as to where Russia’s new international “borders” actually were. Over the weekend Ukrainian troops recaptured the city of Lyman in Donetsk oblast – in theory a part of Russia. On Monday, Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, failed to clarify the issue when he said: “We will continue to consult with the people who live in these areas.” This appeared to be a face-saving formula in the event – as seems likely – of further Russian military setbacks in the coming days and weeks. In the eastern Donbas, local separatist leaders acknowledged that Ukraine’s army had crossed the administrative borders of Luhansk province, advancing from Lyman. Russia controls only about a half of Donetsk oblast. It is going backwards, seven months into Putin’s full-scale invasion. In the eastern city of Sloviansk, there was evidence of the recent battles and continuing offensive as captured Russian armour was towed into the city. The fall of Lyman has opened the way for Ukrainian forces to advance deep into Luhansk province, threatening the main supply routes to territory Moscow captured in some of the war’s bloodiest battles in June and July. Observers in Kyiv were cautious on Monday about the scale of Ukrainian gains in the south. They said continuous battles were going on across a flat steppe landscape. Russian troops were using tanks, mortars, and jets to fire at Ukrainian positions and were making extensive use of drones. They were trying to repair bridges across the Dnieper destroyed by Ukrainian missile strikes. The deputy head of Russia’s puppet administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, acknowledged the Ukrainian army was advancing. But he added that “everything is under control”. He recorded a video standing next to a reed-lined riverbank, with Kherson’s Antonivskyi Bridge visible behind him. Stremousov said: “We are on the ground and continue to take care of the citizens of the Russian Federation of the Kherson region. We are now Russia and everything will be fine.” Speaking on Russian TV, his boss, Vladimir Saldo, admitted things were not entirely going to plan. “It’s tense, let’s put it that way,” he said. Saldo took part in Friday’s ceremony in the Kremlin, shaking hands with Putin. On Monday, the Duma rubber-stamped the “annexation treaty”. Zelenskiy’s senior advisers have humorously pointed out the absurdity and surrealism of Russia “annexing” territory, while at the same time losing control of it. Oleksiy Arestovych tweeted on Monday that “more and more settlements” were “rapidly withdrawing from the Russian Federation”. He added: “Now in the Kherson direction.” Russia occupies only about 30% of the Zaporizhzhia region. This includes the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant but not Zaporizhzhia city, the main urban centre. Social media channels suggested Russian troops have recently stopped civilians from leaving via a crossing point to Ukrainian government-run territory, with hundreds of cars stuck. In the north-east of the country, Ukraine was close to liberating all of the Kharkiv region after a counter-offensive which began last month. The Russian frontline is in the east of the oblast not far from the town of Kupiansk and was said to be collapsing. Ukrainian troops liberated several villages including Shyykivka. They were reportedly moving east and along the right-bank of the Oskil River towards the border with Luhansk oblast and the city of Svatove. One unverified report said Russian soldiers had abandoned their positions in a large forest area without a fight, and were fleeing. The International Atomic Energy Agency said Russia had freed the head of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Ihor Murashov disappeared on Friday while on his way to work at the plant, which Russian troops have occupied since March. A Russian patrol abducted him. The Kremlin has been coercing Ukrainian employees to sign new contracts with Rosatom, its state nuclear agency. The IAEA says it had received confirmation Murashov “had returned to his family safely”. Russia still occupies about 15% of Ukraine, including Crimea. But since September the Ukrainians have reclaimed large chunks of land, via twin counter-offensives in the north-east and south. It remains to be seen if Russia’s mass mobilisation at home will change this equation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/29/uk-offshore-wind-power-renewable-energy-kwasi-kwarteng","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-29T16:25:38Z","webTitle":"UK rules out windfall tax on North Sea oil firms to help fund energy bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/29/uk-offshore-wind-power-renewable-energy-kwasi-kwarteng","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/29/uk-offshore-wind-power-renewable-energy-kwasi-kwarteng","fields":{"headline":"UK rules out windfall tax on North Sea oil firms to help fund energy bills","bodyText":"The business secretary has effectively ruled out a windfall tax on North Sea oil firms to fund discounted energy bills but promised much greater investment in solar panels, wind and nuclear to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas. Speaking amid reports of a cabinet split over landmark energy security plans due to be published within days, Kwasi Kwarteng offered up a tax on oil companies, backed by Labour, as the one policy that definitely will not find favour with ministers. “We believe a windfall tax would be a tax on jobs, would destroy investment and would add to the uncertainty in oil markets,” he said. “It would be completely the wrong message to send investors.” Labour has said the pain inflicted on households by the soaring price of oil and gas could be eased by a tax on the companies that sell it. But Kwarteng has said such a move would penalise anyone with a pension invested in those companies. “It’s a retro measure which completely doesn’t understand what business is all about,” he said. Kwarteng, who was answering questions in the House of Commons on Tuesday, was repeatedly asked if the government had further plans to help households struggling to pay their energy bills. A cap on bills is due to rise by £693 to an average of £1,971 on 1 April, with prices predicted to soar as high as £3,000 at the next price cap increase in October. Kwarteng said “nobody knows” how high prices will go and pointed only to measures announced in chancellor Rishi Sunak’s spring statement, which has been derided for the limitations of its plan to help people cope with the cost-of-living crisis. While the business minister said oil firms would not be hit with a windfall tax, he did unveil a pledge to boost renewable energy sources. The government is aiming to triple the number of solar panels, more than quadruple offshore wind power and double onshore wind and nuclear energy by 2030, in a move that could lower bills for consumers and reduce the UK’s reliance on foreign energy suppliers such as Russia. Kwarteng put forward the targets as part of Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) plans for inclusion in the upcoming energy white paper. The paper has faced delays because the cost of approving at least six nuclear power stations as part of an expansion of the UK’s renewable energy strategy has been debated at the Treasury. Ministers are also divided over plans to back onshore wind. BEIS’s targets include increasing solar power from its current capacity of 14GW to 50GW, offshore wind from 11GW to 50GW, onshore wind from 15GW to 30GW, and nuclear power from 7GW to 16GW, according to the Financial Times. Solar power and onshore wind generation have, to date, not had official government growth targets. Earlier this month, Kwarteng said developing the UK’s energy independence was a matter of national security. Boris Johnson has set out a 10-point plan that includes a target for the UK to get all of its electricity from low-carbon sources by 2035. The expansion of wind and solar farms is likely to be opposed by some residents and campaign groups. Johnson, who has said his personal preference is to expand offshore wind power generation, is considering plans to offer residents affected by the construction of energy farms or nuclear power plants financial incentives to win them over. On Tuesday, SSE, the electricity generator and network company, upgraded its profit forecasts after changes to weather conditions improved output from its renewable energy generation sources. The company – which raised adjusted earnings a share from guidance to between 92p and 97p, up from 90p – also said its thermal and hydro plant benefited from the disruption to oil and gas markets as a result of the war in Ukraine. “SSE’s integrated and balanced business model has performed well in turbulent market conditions,” said the SSE finance director, Gregor Alexander, who added that capital expenditure for the year to the end of March would exceed £2bn. “Our significant investment programme will make a huge contribution towards both net zero and energy security.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/05/unproven-small-nuclear-reactors-would-raise-energy-costs-and-delay-renewable-uptake-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-04T16:30:46Z","webTitle":"‘Unproven’ small nuclear reactors would raise Australia’s energy costs and delay renewable uptake, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/05/unproven-small-nuclear-reactors-would-raise-energy-costs-and-delay-renewable-uptake-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/05/unproven-small-nuclear-reactors-would-raise-energy-costs-and-delay-renewable-uptake-report-says","fields":{"headline":"‘Unproven’ small nuclear reactors would raise Australia’s energy costs and delay renewable uptake, report says","bodyText":"The next generation of small nuclear reactors being advocated by the Coalition would raise electricity prices, slow the uptake of renewables and introduce new risks from nuclear waste, according to a report from the Australian Conservation Foundation. But the report from the conservation group has found only two small modular reactors (SMRs) are known to be operating around the world, in Russia and China, and both have seen large cost blowouts. Promoters of nuclear energy, the report claims, were pinning their hopes on technology that was “uncertain and unproven”. “The good news about the renewed nuclear discussion is that it highlights that business as usual with fossil fuels is not an option,” the report found. “The bad news is the very real risk of delay, distraction and a failure to advance a just energy transition”. Last week during question time, the energy minister, Chris Bowen, mocked the Coalition for supporting nuclear and asked which MP would be willing to have a reactor in their electorate. Nuclear energy has been effectively banned in Australia since the late 1990s, but some Coalition senators are pushing for those restrictions to be lifted. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has tasked the shadow climate minister, Ted O’Brien, to review the status of nuclear energy. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In the report Dave Sweeney, ACF’s Nuclear Free campaigner, wrote SMRs would push up electricity costs and introduce unnecessary challenges in managing nuclear waste. “In short, Australia’s energy future is renewable, not radioactive,” he wrote. According to the report, Russia’s floating nuclear plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, has two small SMR units on board. Construction costs had ballooned sixfold. Work started in 2012 on a demonstration plant in China with two gas-cooled reactors that was completed nine years later, costing $8.8bn. “The global SMR reality simply does not come close to matching the Australian SMR rhetoric,” the report says. Three further SMR plants were under construction in Argentina, China and Russia but had been plagued by cost rises and delays, the report said. In June, a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested future deployment of SMRs could increase the amount of nuclear waste by factors of two to 30, depending on the design. In a report last year for the Minerals Council of Australia, the nuclear energy analyst and advocate Ben Heard argued there was a lack of standardised work on the true cost of SMRs. But he said SMRs would hold a “substantial place in a lowest-cost decarbonised economy” and if they were available in Australia they would “widen the road to that decarbonised future”. Heard argued SMRs could operate for more than 40 years delivering zero-carbon electricity. He wrote: “Deploying nuclear power technologies requires a national uplift in competencies and capabilities that a country retains from that point forward. “That journey might be accelerated, particularly for a nation with established capacity like Australia, but it cannot be rushed.” In June the International Energy Agency said SMRs were not yet commercially viable, but “lower cost, smaller size and reduced project risks” could improve social acceptance. There was increased support and interest in Canada, France, UK and the US for the technology, the report said, adding: “But the successful long-term deployment of SMRs hinges on strong support from policymakers starting now, not just to mobilise investment but also to streamline and harmonise regulatory frameworks.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/27/carbon-emissions-to-peak-in-2025-in-historic-turning-point-says-iea","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T07:49:34Z","webTitle":"Carbon emissions from energy to peak in 2025 in ‘historic turning point’, says IEA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/27/carbon-emissions-to-peak-in-2025-in-historic-turning-point-says-iea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/27/carbon-emissions-to-peak-in-2025-in-historic-turning-point-says-iea","fields":{"headline":"Carbon emissions from energy to peak in 2025 in ‘historic turning point’, says IEA","bodyText":"Global carbon emissions from energy will peak in 2025 thanks to massively increased government spending on clean fuels in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to analysis by the world’s leading energy organisation. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said that government spending on clean energy in response to the crisis would mark a “historic turning point” in the transition away from fossil fuels, in its annual report on global energy. The invasion of Ukraine has prompted an energy crisis around the world, with global gas prices initially surging. The crisis has caused steep inflation that has made households poorer around the world. Governments have been scrambling to find other sources of energy. Some analysts have questioned whether fears over energy security could lead to the use of fossil fuels for longer, slowing the world’s race to net zero carbon emissions. Some countries – including the US and the UK under previous prime minister Liz Truss – have pledged to encourage fossil fuel extraction to try to ease prices. However, Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director and one of the world’s most influential energy economists, said the energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion “is in fact going to accelerate the clean energy transition”. The IEA said planned investments in green energy in response to the crisis meant that – for the first time – government policies would lead to demand for polluting fossil fuels peaking this decade. The agency cited notable contributions from the US Inflation Reduction Act, the EU’s emissions reduction package, and actions by Japan, South Korea, China and India. Under the new plans investment in low-carbon energy such as solar, wind and nuclear power will rise to $2tn (£1.7tn) a year by 2030, an increase of more than 50% from today. However, annual clean energy investment would have to reach $4tn by 2030 to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a figure that illustrates the scale of the challenge facing governments around the world. The IEA analysis showed that current government policies would still lead to global temperatures rising by 2.5C, which would have catastrophic climate impacts. That would be far above the target of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The 1.5C target, agreed at the Paris climate conference, would prevent the worst effects of climate breakdown. The analysis adds to a consensus among scientists that governments are not doing enough to prevent climate disaster. A separate UN study, published on Wednesday, also found that government pledges so far to cut emissions will lead to 2.5C of heating. The wave of clean energy investment will also cost Russia $1tn in lost fossil fuel revenues by 2030 compared with before the invasion, Birol said. Russia, previously the world’s largest exporter of fossil fuels, would have a “much diminished role in international energy affairs” as the world’s reliance on burning methane gas for power falls, he added. “The golden age of gas is approaching the end,” Birol said. Birol said the crisis had not changed the IEA’s assessment, first published last year, that all new fossil fuel projects should stop immediately in order for the world to hit net zero emissions by 2050. New oil and gas extraction projects “will jeopardise our climate goals”, he said. He also dismissed criticism from some climate deniers that spending on clean energy had contributed to higher energy prices, saying that argument was “hiding who sparked the energy crisis, which is Russia”. The IEA found that higher shares of renewable energy were correlated with lower electricity prices. “None of the government leaders complained about too much clean energy,” Birol said. “They complain that they don’t have enough clean energy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-301-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-21T17:34:46Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 301 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-301-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-301-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 301 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has confirmed he is on his way to the US, his first foreign trip since the war broke out 300 days ago. The US president, Joe Biden, released a statement saying that Zelenskiy will go to the White House on Wednesday before addressing a joint session of Congress “demonstrating the strong, bipartisan support for Ukraine”. A senior US administration official denied that Biden will pressure Zelenskiy to seek a diplomatic end to the war. Zelenskiy’s visit to the US is “extremely significant” and will disprove Russian attempts to show that US-Ukrainian relations are “cooling”, Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. The Ukrainian president’s trip and meeting with his US counterpart will provide an opportunity to explain the real situation in Ukraine, what weapons Kyiv needs to fight Moscow, and why it needs them, Podolyak told Reuters. The Kremlin has said nothing good will come of Zelenskiy’s trip to Washington and that Russia sees no chance of peace talks with Kyiv. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that continued western arms supplies to Ukraine would lead to a “deepening” of the conflict – something that could backfire on Kyiv, he warned. Air raid alerts were heard across all parts of Ukraine on Wednesday, according to local officials. There was no immediate word of a new wave of Russian attacks. Vladimir Putin has vowed that Russia will fulfil all the goals of what Moscow calls its “military campaign” in Ukraine in an end-of-year meeting of his top defence officials. In his speech, where he laid his country’s military plans to defence chiefs in Moscow, Putin said he will ensure that Russia’s nuclear forces are combat-ready and that there were no financial limits on what the government would provide its military. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has called for his country’s military to be expanded from its current 1 million servicemen to 1.5 million amid the fighting in Ukraine. Speaking at an end-of-year conference with Russia’s military chiefs and Putin, also proposed raising the age range for mandatory Russian military service to cover Russian citizens aged 21-30. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has undertaken a surprise trip to Beijing and held talks with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during which he said they discussed the Ukraine conflict. Medvedev, now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said he and Xi had discussed the two countries’ “no limits” strategic partnership, as well as Ukraine. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, will visit Russia on Thursday for discussions on the creation of a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, the Russian state-owned RIA Novosti news agency reported, citing Russia’s envoy to the international institutions in Vienna. President Zelenskiy visited the frontline city of Bakhmut on Tuesday. He met military representatives and handed out awards to soldiers, his office has said. A blast ripped through the Urengoi-Pomary-Uzhhorod gas exporting pipeline that leads from Russia through Ukraine. Reuters reported that three people died in the incident. Ukraine was warned to prepare for new Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. Prime minister Denys Shmyhal said Moscow wanted Ukraine to spend Christmas and new year in darkness. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said the situation in four areas of eastern Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – that Moscow illegally annexed in September, was “extremely difficult”. Russia’s illegal annexation of the four territories, which together make up 15% of Ukraine, marked the largest forcible takeover of territory in Europe since the second world war and was condemned by Kyiv and its western allies as illegal. Russia has suffered acute setbacks in the areas, halting its ambitions. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, on Tuesday condemned Iran’s support for Russia in its war in Ukraine and the ongoing repression of opposition in the country, but said the EU would continue to work with Iran on restoring the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. “Necessary meeting with Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in Jordan amid deteriorating Iran-EU relations,” Borrell tweeted ahead of a regional conference being hosted by Jordan. Ukraine is accelerating efforts to erase the vestiges of Soviet and Russian influence from its public spaces by pulling down monuments and renaming hundreds of streets to honour its own artists, poets, soldiers, independence leaders and others – including heroes of this year’s war. Since the war began, Ukraine’s leaders have shifted a campaign that once focused on dismantling its communist past into one of “de-Russification”. China says Chinese-Russian naval drills beginning on Wednesday aim to “further deepen” cooperation between the two countries whose unofficial anti-western alliance has gained strength since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The drills will be held off the coast of Zhejiang province south of Shanghai until next Tuesday, according to a brief notice posted Monday by China’s eastern theatre command under the ruling Communist party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/oct/26/the-climate-book-by-greta-thunberg-review-global-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-26T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"The Climate Book by Greta Thunberg review – global warning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/26/the-climate-book-by-greta-thunberg-review-global-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/oct/26/the-climate-book-by-greta-thunberg-review-global-warning","fields":{"headline":"The Climate Book by Greta Thunberg review – global warning","bodyText":"We are supposed to have solved this problem in just under 30 years. That’s the same amount of time that has elapsed since Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner smooched in The Bodyguard. Governments’ commitment to limit global heating to 1.5C above the preindustrial average means the huge transition to net zero will have to be made by 2050. By then, renewables should be producing most of our energy – certainly all the electricity in rich countries – and we should all be driving around in electric cars, eating sustainable, mainly plant-based foods and living in well-insulated houses built from low-carbon materials. The many books written about how to avoid the climate crisis will hopefully have become obsolete. Which of them will survive to be read beyond the combustion era, if only by historians – as testament to this period of crisis and uncertainty? Well, Greta Thunberg is already assured her place in history as the Jeanne d’Arc (or Cassandra) of our time. She’s been heroically battling the forces of climate inaction and denial since she stepped on to the global stage as a shy 15-year-old schoolkid “striking for the climate”. Anything written or orchestrated by her – like this appealingly produced anthology of essays – stands an excellent chance. Thunberg herself writes with the stark conviction of youth and an activist’s directness, which is both refreshing to read and tiring. Fortunately, space is given to writers who weave messages with skill and beauty, like Peter Brannen, who takes the chemistry of the carbon cycle and presents it as the marvellous life force it is. Warning us where we’re heading, he evokes an episode of global warming from Earth’s history: “In the aftermath, when the fever finally broke, one could travel the world without seeing a tree, the world’s coral reefs had been replaced by bacterial slime, the fossil record went silent and the planet took nearly 10 million years to pull itself back from oblivion.” Naomi Oreskes writes fiercely about “the history of denial and obfuscation by the fossil fuel industry”, and there are stirring contributions from the climate scientist Kate Marvel and the novelist Amitav Ghosh. This is a campaigning book of course, but much more than that. There are clear explanations of how human activities are pushing Earth’s systems close to dangerous tipping points, and of the socioeconomic drivers of the crisis. We are told throughout that if we don’t limit global temperature rises to 1.5C, we face disaster, yet planned fossil fuel production by 2030 will be more than twice the amount consistent with this target. In short, we are very unlikely to meet our transition target by 2050. What then? In a book of more than 400 pages, just one and a half are given over to technologies aimed at reducing global heating by reflecting sunlight back into space. That particular essay can be summed up in a quote: “Geoengineering is not an option.” The idea of withdrawing emitted carbon from the atmosphere gets a little more (reluctant) attention, because “we’ve left Greta’s generation little choice”. Nuclear power is barely mentioned even though decarbonising energy systems is fundamental to this effort. For all Thunberg’s brilliance and bravery, ignoring these possibilities feel timorous and blinkered. This book is superb at explaining the urgency and importance of preventing climate change, but despite its heft it stops too soon. There is little pragmatism over what to do about now-certain changes, which means it feels like a book whose time was 10 years ago. But perhaps it has taken this decade for an audience that’s receptive to its message to develop. History will show. • The Climate Book by Greta Thunberg is published by Allen Lane (£25).

Jana Kalaaji, a Syrian-Lebanese student who has been at the city’s university for a year, said: “There’s no electricity now. There is no water. There is no tapwater. There are no supplies. There is no heat because the heat comes with electricity.” “Today I went to different markets in different places: one in the centre, one close to me, and one far from me. All of them are closed. I don’t think there’s supplies any more for the citizens here,” Kalaaji said. “No one understand the situation here because it’s crazy. One student interviewed by Indian TV on Friday begged for immediate help, and confirmed they were running out of food and water. “Please take some immediate action or else we will die for sure,” she said. Earlier this week, it emerged that 500 foreign students were stuck in the city, including almost 400 Nigerians, three Irish students and pupils from Rwanda, Lebanon and Tanzania. Indian media are reporting that there are between 700 and 1,000 more. Aashik Hussain Sarkar, an Indian medical student, said they witnessed a massive bomb in Friday: “Please evacuate us immediately. More than 1,000 Indians are waiting.” One student told the Indian network NDTV they had been waiting on the street for buses to take them to the border when a loud explosion occurred and they rushed to the bunker under their student apartment block. Sumy was still under Ukrainian control, according to the students. A student said: “Right now there is no electricity. There is shortage of water. When we heard that bombardment sound, we just took our passport and we ran into the bunkers. We were really so scared. This time the noise was really really extreme. “We were waiting for a military pass to the border for one-and-a-half hours and at this last moment we heard this noise and we were shifted in here. Now the current situation is the Ukrainian government is now allowing us to travel to the border.” “The explosion was really huge because we felt this in the bunker,” her friend said. The Indian students were all in a single apartment building in Sumy and were reliant on small deliveries of food and water from a local church, said Chandramohan Nallur, an Indian volunteer at the Polish border, helping students stuck in the country. “Luckily I found a contact who used to live in Lviv. They are arranging some food and water through a church,” he said. “There are about 700 in one building. Shelling is still going on; there’s a lot of panic.” Another student said their hopes of rescue were dying, with armed men seen outside their hostel making it unsafe to go out. All public transport out of the town has been cancelled and going the 25-mile (40km) distance to the Russian border is impossible. Christiana Diyaolu, from Carlow in Ireland, whose 19-year-old sister Racheal is trapped, told RTÉ that a journey to the southern or western border would take 20 hours and would be unviable because of bombs, gunfire and shelling. “This is the first time my sister has been away from home since she was born. We just want her to come home,” she said. Oluwaseun Adefemi, a Nigerian medical student, and three others told how they managed to escape from Sumy on Thursday in a private vehicle. But they said it was a dangerous journey out of the city, where they heard blasts, and passed damaged military equipment and soldiers conducting a burial. Kalaaji said she was aware of some students having escaped by car as far as the Ukrainian town of Poltava. “I don’t know if I will do the same. It may just have been luck [that the other students escaped,” she said. “None of the students here are waiting or expecting anything from the government any more”. Nigeria’s government said on Thursday it was advocating for a safe corridor by which 368 students who were stuck in Sumy could leave. The Indian government said 3,000 students had already been evacuated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/nato-chief-warns-of-worse-suffering-in-ukraine-and-russian-attacks-elsewhere","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T15:34:59Z","webTitle":"Russia steps up onslaught after Ukraine ‘narrowly’ escapes nuclear disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/nato-chief-warns-of-worse-suffering-in-ukraine-and-russian-attacks-elsewhere","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/nato-chief-warns-of-worse-suffering-in-ukraine-and-russian-attacks-elsewhere","fields":{"headline":"Russia steps up onslaught after Ukraine ‘narrowly’ escapes nuclear disaster","bodyText":"The US envoy to the UN said the world had narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe in Russia’s attack on Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, as Moscow’s forces intensified their devastating campaign of artillery and airstrikes against civilian areas of Ukraine. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, speaking at an emergency meeting of the UN security council in New York on Friday, the US envoy said Russia’s actions, which caused a major fire at the Zaporizhzhia compound, reflected a “dangerous new escalation” in its invasion of Ukraine. “Russia’s attack last night put Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at grave risk,” she said. “It was incredibly reckless and dangerous. And it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe.” Meanwhile, Ukraine’s president issued a rebuke to Nato which earlier refused to impose a no-fly zone, over concerns that doing so could cause the war to escalate across Europe. In a furious late night speech, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity. “The alliance has given the green light to the bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages by refusing to create a no-fly zone.” At a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance could not directly engage with Russian forces. “The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send Nato fighter planes into Ukraine’s airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,” Stoltenberg said. Western leaders expressed outrage at the incident at Zaporizhzhia, with the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, describing Putin’s actions as “now directly threatening the safety of all of Europe” and the US president, Joe Biden, condemning Moscow for the shelling, which Russia claimed was a “monstrous provocation” by Ukrainian saboteurs. The US embassy in Kyiv called the attack a “war crime” in a post on Twitter but the US state department reportedly distanced itself from the allegation, instructing its other embassies not to retweet the claim. The fire, at a training centre on the site’s perimeter, was extinguished on Friday and officials said radiation was normal. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said the reactors were undamaged but the situation “naturally continues to be extremely tense and challenging”. Russian forces seized the plant after heavy fighting. Russian ground forces in the south of Ukraine made an assault on the shipbuilding centre of Mykolaiv as they began their long-expected push west towards the key port of Odesa. Kyiv came under fresh heavy attack and local authorities in the northern city of Chernihiv raised the death toll from a missile strike on residential buildings on Thursday to 47. In Russia, reporting of the war by international and local independent media was put under increasing pressure as the lower house of parliament passed a law punishing the intentional spreading of “fake” news about the military with 15 years in jail. The BBC announced it was suspending all operations in the country and the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, edited by the Nobel peace prize winner Dmitry Muratov, said it would be removing content on Ukraine. Access to Facebook and Twitter was also completely blocked in retaliation for the social media platforms’ restrictions on state-backed media. At the Nato foreign ministers’s meeting Stoltenberg, described the Russian invasion of Ukraine as “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades … with cities under siege, schools, hospitals, and residential buildings shelled”. In a sobering assessment of the military situation, he told reporters there was evidence of the use of cluster bombs and “other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law”, adding: “The days to come are likely to be worse.” He warned that there was also a growing risk of the war spreading to Georgia, on whose territory Vladimir Putin’s troops are already present, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, where Bosnian Serbs have been threatening to break up the state with the Kremlin’s support. The UN human rights office said it had confirmed 331 civilians, including 19 children, had been killed and 675 injured since the invasion began on 24 February, adding that the real toll would be much higher. Most were killed by explosive weapons such as shelling from heavy artillery, multi-launch rocket systems, missiles and airstrikes. The UN refugee and children’s agencies said more than 1.2 million people had fled the country, including about half of a million children. The UNCHR spokesperson Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams described the rate as “phenomenal”, adding that an equal number were probably displaced inside Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said the EU was working with NGOs in Ukraine to establish “humanitarian corridors”, after agreement between Kyiv and representatives from the Kremlin on Thursday. “Humanitarian aid must be able to reach all parts of Ukraine and civilians must be allowed to escape cities under siege,” she said. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said in Brussels that the west was “faced with what is President Putin’s war of choice: unprovoked, unjustified, and a war that is having horrific, horrific consequences for real people. For mothers, fathers. For children. We see the images on TV, and it has to stop.” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who had joined the meeting in Brussels by video link, showed Blinken and EU foreign ministers photographs of the carnage being wrought. “One of which I think has also been in the media shows a father grieving over his dead child,” Blinken said. “Blood is still on the sheet, the drapes, it’s a reminder that even as we talk about these weighty issues of war and peace, what this is really about is the lives of men, women, children, hundreds, thousands of individual human tragedies inflicted by Vladimir Putin and his war of choice on Ukraine and its people and we can’t lose sight of that fact.” Putin, however, dismissed reports of airstrikes on Kyiv and other large Ukrainian cities as “gross propaganda fakes” in a phone call with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the Kremlin said. The Russian president “confirmed Russia is open to dialogue” with Ukraine but only “on condition all Russian demands are met”, it said. Those demands included neutral and non-nuclear status for Ukraine and its “denazification”, the recognition of Crimea as part of Russia and of the “sovereignty” of separatist territories in eastern Ukraine, Moscow said. Putin told Scholz he hoped “Kyiv will take a reasonable and constructive position” in a third round of talks planned for next week, the Kremlin statement added. Putin separately warned Russia’s neighbours on Friday “not to escalate the situation” by imposing more restrictions on his country. As Russian forces stepped up their assault on cities particularly in the south and east of Ukraine, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country had “survived a night that could have stopped the story, the history of Ukraine, the history of Europe”. A day after Moscow’s forces took control of the strategically important city of Kherson, the invading troops continued to besiege population centres, particularly in southern Ukraine, pounding them with artillery and airstrikes and causing devastating damage. The governor of Mykolaiv said Russian troops had entered his city of about 500,000 people, although a presidential adviser later said the advance had been halted. The south-eastern port city of Mariupol is also encircled by Russian forces and heavily bombarded, but remains under Ukrainian control. The city’s deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said its humanitarian situation was “terrible” after 40 hours of continuous shelling including on schools and hospitals. “I believe that he wants to destroy Ukraine as a nation, and Mariupol is on this way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/russia-ukraine-how-the-west-woke-up-to-vladimir-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T14:12:20Z","webTitle":"The week where decades happened: how the west finally woke up to Putin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-ukraine-how-the-west-woke-up-to-vladimir-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-ukraine-how-the-west-woke-up-to-vladimir-putin","fields":{"headline":"The week where decades happened: how the west finally woke up to Putin","bodyText":"Lenin, a Russian leader as obsessed with history as Vladimir Putin, famously said: “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.” This has been the latter. The little more than a week since Russian troops invaded Ukraine has indeed shaken the world. Change has been telescoped, national taboos broken, moribund institutions given purpose and the spectre of a nuclear war in Europe has been raised for the first time since the 1980s. Germany has called it Zeitenwende, the turning point. It will not just be Ukraine that is changed for ever by this war. But there is something specific about how war accelerates change. In The Deluge, his classic work on how society is changed by war, the British historian Arthur Marwick wrote: “War acts as a supreme challenge to, and test of, a country’s social and political institutions. War results not only in the destruction of inefficient institutions (such as the Tsarist regime in Russia), but also in the transformation of less efficient mechanisms into more efficient ones”. The west has surprised itself with its ability to respond to the misery inflicted on the people of Ukraine. All kinds of unimaginable images emerge. The German Bundestag cheered an extra €100bn (£82.4bn) on defence spending, followed by 100,000 people on the streets in protest at Putin. Matteo Salvini, the great Italian defender of Putin, bringing white tulips to the Ukrainian embassy. Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, attending a meeting of the EU foreign affairs ministers meeting. The Hungarian leader, Viktor Orbán, sharply criticised by human-rights groups and others over the years for his hardline border policies, sitting on a school bench opening his arms to refugees. It was just a fortnight ago that the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, had appeared at the Munich security conference to caution the crisis was not the moment to try to execute an 180-degree turn on the decades-old German policy banning the sale of arms into conflict zones. Josep Borrell, the EU external affairs chief, batted away calls for Ukraine to join the EU, saying they already had an exceptional trade deal. He spoke about the “power of the EU’s language”, distancing himself from his own one-time claim that the EU must learn “the language of power”. The next day – Sunday – all the talk was of Emmanuel Macron’s diplomatic initiative, and the concessions the French president had extracted from Vladimir Putin. Even on Wednesday, on the eve of the invasion, Baerbock gave an interview saying it was impossible for Germany to impose the strongest sanctions because of “the massive collateral damage” to Germany’s own economy. Putin could end up laughing at us, she warned. Yet by the following weekend, two days after the invasion began on Thursday, Germany’s coalition government had started that 180-degree course correction. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his cabinet agreed to send Ukraine 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 anti-aircraft Stinger missiles, lifting restrictions on German weapons being sent to conflict zones by third parties in the process. The next day, Scholz told the Bundestag in his trademark matter-of-fact manner that he was injecting €100bn into German defence, but protecting other budgets, and defence spending would rise above 2% of German GDP. The MPs from government and the CDU gasped and cheered in equal measure. David McAllister, a leading figure in the German CDU and chair of the European parliament’s foreign affairs select committee, admits he nearly fell off his chair when he heard the plans. The promised growth catapults Germany into becoming the third largest spender on defence globally, behind only the US and China. GlobalData forecasts an annual German defence budget of $83.5bn in 2024, equating to a 45% increase on 2021’s budget of $57.5bn. That is bigger than France and the UK. Overnight Germany became not just an economic but also a geopolitical powerhouse. Polls said 78% of Germans backed the decision. Matthias Matthijs, Europe senior fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “It is quite astonishing how fast this government broke pretty well every taboo in postwar German foreign policy.” He attributes the scale of the change to a visit to Berlin on Sunday by the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. “I came to Berlin to shake the conscience of Germany,” Morawiecki said. Sophia Besch, from the Centre for European Reform, points out Scholz himself insisted he had not acted due to pressure from allies, but due to Germany changing its view of the threat posed by Putin. “The truth is the world did not change last Thursday,” she said. “Berlin for years has ignored the warnings that came from many of our allies and from Putin. We need to learn the lessons of how this could have happened and how we could have been so blind. We are leaving behind some of our old beliefs – that economic interdependence prevents conflict, but I am not sure we know yet with what we are replacing this belief.” Sergey Lagodinsky, a German Green MEP, argued Germany needs not only to spend more money, but to shift its mindset without becoming militaristic or interventionist. It needs to discuss how to adopt escalation, including military escalation, as leverage as part of its foreign policy toolbox. Foreign policy is not just a peace policy, Friedenspolitik in German, but also the ability to deal, manage and face conflict. But the new German coalition, faced by the need to extricate itself from Russian energy, may have to challenge other orthodoxies. The Green economics minister, Robert Habeck, does not rule out extending the use of coal-fired power plants. “This blind, naive, one-sided relationship of dependency on Russia for energy for decades is one of the biggest strategic mistakes of the past 20 years,” Lagodinsky said. “Now we are stuck. It represents a medium- and long-term problem”. But Putin’s recklessness is not just causing a revolution in Germany, but across Europe. Sweden abandoned its policy of not sending weapons to conflict zones, agreeing to send Bofors AT-4, a single-use anti-tank launcher, to Ukraine, plus medical supplies. In Finland, a bombshell poll showed 53% want Finland to join Nato. “This poll flipped everything on its head,” said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. Moreover the poll showed that if voters were told that politicians said they backed the plan the support went up to two-thirds. “You could sense the president, Sauli Niinisto, realised the whole defence dynamic was changed.” Niinisto, seen as one of the best readers of what Putin is thinking is now rushing to hold urgent talks with Joe Biden in the White House. Even in Switzerland, leaders had to catch up with the public mood in the space of a weekend, and by the Monday an emergency cabinet promised to implement the entire EU sanctions package. The decision does not formally end a policy of neutrality that has survived two world wars, but there is now pressure to track down the many oligarchs that live in the country. There are also calls for an increase in the defence budget There has been a mini-revolution in Italy, too, where the prime minister, Mario Draghi, accused last week of seeking sanctions carve-outs to protect Italy’s dependence on Russian gas, has also found some mettle. He told parliament on Tuesday: “Yes, we want peace, but it is obvious that whoever amassed more than 60km of tanks near Kyiv does not want peace. We cannot turn our backs on Ukraine. Italy does not intend to look away.” He proposed an international public register of those with assets of more than €10m. In France, Macron looks likely to be re-elected comfortably next month as the rightwing candidates find themselves compromised by links to Putin they cannot deny. Eastern European countries, sometimes hostile to refugees, have instead had the most open arms. Poland has taken an unprecedented 600,000 people. Orbán the Hungarian leader photographed smiling at child refugees, vows “No one will be left uncared for.” The UK too has been experiencing unusually heavy traffic on the Road to Damascus. The Conservative government promises there will be no hiding place for oligarchs, publishing the delayed economic crime bill and seemingly unnerving Roman Abramovich into selling his stake in Chelsea football club. The endless denigration of Brussels has stopped. “The quality and intensity of the contacts between the EU and UK has been different to anything since before Brexit,” one EU official said. “We have restored a level of trust”. But it has been at the level of the European Union that the action has been quickest and most surprising, revealing Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU Commission and former German defence minister, as a powerful advocate for action. For the EU to release €500m from the European Peace Facility to provide equipment and supplies to the Ukrainian armed forces, including - for the first time – lethal equipment, was a first. EU military staff based in Poland are now coordinating military supplies into Ukraine. The EU as a military player is no longer just the stuff of seminars. Equally, the Commission in discussing its EU sanctions package acted with an unparalleled speed, and by consensus among the member states. Some EU sanctions packages take months to be agreed as one country or other exploiting the requirement for unanimity uses their veto power to pursue a national interest. That the UK, US and EU were able to coordinate an attack on the Russian central bank, freezing out some Russian banks from the global Swift bank payment system and implementing measures to prevent Russian banks and firms raising capital, showed a wholly unexpected level of resolve. This was a financial declaration of war – an attempt to turn Russia into a pariah economy – something never tried before, using methods never deployed before. It involved, for instance, some G20 central banks freezing the Russian central bank reserves held in their own jurisdiction, so depleting the war chest of reserves that Putin had accumulated to defend his economy if it came under western attack. All this is remarkable, indeed epoch-making, but not a cause for celebration. The institutions of liberal democracy may have belatedly shown resolve and unity, but in the here and now they are still losing. Keir Giles, from the Chatham House thinktank, is blunt: “Russia will want to present Zelenskiy with an appalling choice – whether to fight on at immense human cost and to the destruction of his country, infrastructure and economy or to submit to his terms in order that life can go on. “The decision to abandon Ukraine to that fate was made by the west when it gave the green light to Putin by reassuring him that no one would intervene. Nato does not have a strategy to win the war in Ukraine because Nato does not want to be in the war in Ukraine.” European politicians will also be worrying as the price of bread and energy soars in the months ahead whether voters are willing to make the sacrifice. the Lithuanian foreign minister told the UK foreign affairs select committee that half-measures would not do. “Putin has no boundaries to what instruments he is going to use and unleash against the Ukrainians”, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said, adding the west “had to go all-in”. He wants humanitarian corridors supported by no-fly zones. But the UK and the US have firmly rejected this since it would pit Nato pilots against Russian pilots. A Polish plan, backed by Borrell for Nato to provide Ukraine with Nato jets, training and bombs, got shot down in less than a day. The other remaining option is to end the final carve-outs in the sanctions regime. “The push is now for carpet sanctions to match the carpet bombing,” said Orysia Lutsevych from the Ukraine Forum, adding the UK, EU and the US are still buying more than €700m of oil, gas and other commodities that is the equivalent of 150 tanks a day that Russia can finance. That could be stopped either through an energy trade embargo, or by reversing the EU decision to let Gazprombank and Sberbank, the vehicles through which Europe pays for Russian oil and gas, stay in the Swift payment system. UK officials briefed on Wednesday they want to abolish the carve out given by the EU. If these two banks are thrown out of Swift that might immobilise Russian oil and gas exports, or lead to unspecified retaliation by Putin. The breadth and range of economic and financial measures taken against Moscow, not to mention growing sporting and cultural isolation, has been a humiliation for Putin, but it is also a risk for the west if the Russian leader sees no answer but total victory. “He is in a corner, but unfortunately with nuclear weapons, says Giles. The west has been transformed in a week, but the question this weekend is if it would be willing, forced by the chaos of events, to go even further. The charge facing the west after a week of war is the one made by George Orwell of Neville Chamberlain in 1938. Like almost everyone at the time, he “neither wanted to pay the price of peace nor that of war”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/04/pork-prices-likely-to-rise-due-to-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-says-defra-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T12:48:47Z","webTitle":"UK pork prices likely to rise due to Russia-Ukraine conflict, says minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/04/pork-prices-likely-to-rise-due-to-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-says-defra-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/04/pork-prices-likely-to-rise-due-to-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-says-defra-minister","fields":{"headline":"UK pork prices likely to rise due to Russia-Ukraine conflict, says minister","bodyText":"The price of food including pork is likely to rise significantly as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a UK environment minister has warned. Victoria Prentis, the Defra minister responsible for farming, also suggested Britons may want to stop buying Russian white fish, which makes up about a third of the volume consumed in the UK. Prentis warned that British people would have to become more willing to pay premium prices for quality food produced domestically. Speaking at the launch of the Conservative Environment Network’s Green Albion essay collection, she said: “I’ve been having really important meetings with the fishing industry. Thirty per cent of our white fish, for example, is imported from Russia. Get real, guys.” The minister told the Guardian further sanctions were being considered that could affect the fishing industry, but suggested consumers boycott the Russian fish. She said: “For now, do we really want to be buying Russian fish?” Prior to the invasion, Prentis had been mostly focused on the cost of living crisis as well as the shift to more environmentally friendly farming, implementing the environmental land management schemes (Elms) which would have farmers paid subsidies for improving biodiversity and nature on their land. However, she has found herself dealing with potential supply-chain failures as a result of the war. “I am going to dial down the optimism because we are in the middle of the most extraordinary series of world events,” she said. As an example of how the events in Europe could drive up prices, the minister said: “I’ve been talking to the pig industry – a very, very difficult supply chain at all levels – are we prepared to buy more British high-welfare pigs? We will have to pay more.” She said that while environmental policies were still a priority, “we need to make sure that the policy we’re making at every stage is correct to the stage we’re in. And frankly the stage for this week is completely different from the stage we were in last week.” There are fears of a wheat crisis on the continent, as Russia and Ukraine account for 14% of global wheat production, ranking first and fifth, respectively. The countries together account for nearly 30% of global wheat exports. Prentis has been meeting her counterparts in Europe to discuss this. She said: “I am so grateful that in this country we grow 88% of the wheat we eat. I met the Albanian foreign minister earlier this week, who imports 44% of her wheat – in a very poor country – from Ukraine. We are in a very fortunate position in many ways.” Another battle Prentis has been fighting is with her Conservative colleagues who have criticised the Elms scheme. Some of her critics argue that farmers should be given more subsidies for producing food rather than solely for environmental goods. The Conservative MP Neil Parish, who chairs the environment select committee, recently said: “There is an issue of food security, because Ukraine is the breadbasket of the world, as is the western part of Russia: I have visited Bryansk in the past and I remember that the one thing I wanted to bring home with me was the soil. I have never seen such beautiful soil in my life. It can grow absolutely everything. “As we change agricultural policy, we need to protect the environment but we need food. There is not enough food in the Agriculture Act.” Prentis said of her critics: “I really feel that we’ve got to stop viewing ourselves as environmentalists or farmers and there being any sort of boundary between the two. “Quite frankly, it really pisses me off that so many of us are onboard with this programme and we are going in one direction but that we are having these ridiculous arguments about which bit [of funding] goes where in the programme.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/30/australia-finally-has-a-policy-that-will-cut-emissions-and-thats-a-cold-hard-fact","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-30T01:23:44Z","webTitle":"A climate policy that actually cuts emissions?

It’s the reality that fossil fuel bosses and News Corp commentators can’t see","bodyText":"At some stage, policies that governments put forward to reduce emissions need to do exactly what they say on the tin. This week’s deal between Labor and the Greens to improve a policy covering Australia’s biggest polluters does, finally, achieve that. The details are complicated (we’ll get into them in just a little bit) but the changes to the safeguard mechanism take the country a step closer to the goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 – though there is still far more to do. These are goals that consecutive Australian governments have signed up to. Yet much of the coverage and commentary around this week’s deal, particularly in conservative media, ignores this simple fact. The Australian newspaper was the conduit for many of the fossil fuel industry’s protests that the policy would “force up power prices and put domestic gas supply at risk” according to one story, and “destroy jobs and kill foreign investment” in the coal industry, according to another. In the Daily Telegraph, a story claimed the changes to the safeguard mechanism would risk $96bn of energy projects and these should be seen as “coal-hard facts”. Significant portions of the fossil fuel industry appear unable to accept the cold-hard realities of atmospheric physics, the community’s demand for action, the decarbonising trajectory of global energy supplies and Australia’s obligations under global agreements that are all lining up to say the same thing on the policy tin. And that tin says: “Stop releasing greenhouse gases.” First, a quick reminder of what’s happened. The safeguard mechanism is a key plank of the Labor government’s pledge to cut emissions by 43% by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2050. The scheme covers about one-third of Australia’s current emissions. Any project that emits at least 100,000 tonnes of CO2 in a year (electricity generators are excluded) is included, and there are a lot of coalmines and gas projects on the list, alongside refineries, smelters and other mining operations. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The government’s deal with the Greens ensures that gross emissions under the mechanism will be effectively capped at 140m tonnes of CO2-equivalent and then decline. Emissions covered by the scheme cannot go up. In some ways, the safeguard mechanism is a downsized domestic version of the broader global challenge of emissions reduction. For Australia’s – and the world’s – big emitters, the safeguard mechanism presents two very simple options. Either companies find ways to make a profit that don’t involve liberating billions of tonnes of ancient fossil carbon, or they find ways to stop the greenhouse gases from their projects being released into the atmosphere. If companies and their industry lobby groups were serious about their public support for keeping global temperatures to 1.5C, then there is no third option that allows emissions to keep climbing with the victims of the climate crisis sacrificed on the altar of jobs and growth. That’s a point entirely missing from much of the commentary this week, particularly from conservative media and the fossil fuel industry. Within this, companies will still be able to use carbon offsets to meet some of their targets says Tennant Reed, director of climate energy at the Australian Industry Group. “But [the safeguard mechanism amendments] does make clear that overall covered emissions do have to fall over time, even before taking account of offsets. That should not be particularly controversial,” he said. Reed makes the point that demand for coal and gas exports will probably play a much bigger role in the fate of those sectors than the design of a domestic policy. All of Australia’s trading partners have commitments to reach net zero over the coming decades, Reed says, so “it is hard to escape the conclusion that falling demand will eventually see exports shrink dramatically.” “That will be a painful transition, and one over which Australia has no veto. The small consolation prize for the coal and gas sectors would be that such customer decisions would make it much easier for them to comply with the safeguard.” Demonisation? One Australian coal boss told the Australian the changes to the safeguard mechanism were built on a political objective to push a “base demonisation of fossil fuels” that would threaten Australia’s role as a “reliable energy exporter” for the region. Actually, Australia is a “reliable” exporter of fossil fuels that are helping drive up global greenhouse gas emissions, worsening the already pernicious affects of climate change that include, but are not limited to, longer and more intense heatwaves, increased risk of flooding, rising sea levels (that will threaten many coastal cities around the world), ecosystem collapse, ocean acidification, longer and more intense bushfires and droughts and ever more extreme weather events. The “demonisation of fossil fuels” – if you want to call it that – comes from basic atmospheric physics and decades of scientific endeavour now confirmed by real-world events. As much as some might like to paint that as politics, it shouldn’t be. ‘In a frenzy’ Former editor of the Australian Chris Mitchell wrote in a column in that newspaper that environment journalists and the “left media” were “in a frenzy” over the most recent release from the UN’s climate panel. They were missing elephants in the room, he wrote, one of which was “the failure of a climate catastrophe, or anything like it, to arrive”. “Sorry what … where has he been?,” asked an incredulous associate professor Sara Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at UNSW Canberra and expert on extreme weather events. “Has he not seen the floods or the heatwaves or the bushfires? I don’t know what he’s looking for, but a climate catastrophe won’t happen everywhere to everyone all at the same time. “But we’re seeing again and again and again extreme events that impact people all around the world and at different times. Those impacts are getting broader, they’re costing us more and they’re taking more lives.” Mitchell appeared to want to present himself as a pragmatic realist, claiming the world could not – and would not – do without fossil fuels (which is a much easier position to take if you don’t accept the evidence of their damage to begin with). Mitchell decided to quote a US-based oil company executive, who had written on LinkedIn that in “all International Energy Agency scenarios” of future energy use, oil consumption rises and natural gas consumption continues to grow. “None of this should be a surprise to environment writers. Most just don’t report inconvenient facts,” writes Mitchell. OK then. Here’s the first line in the oil and gas section of the IEA’s report on how it thinks global economies can reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. “The energy transition envisioned in the [Net-Zero Emissions Scenario] involves a major contraction of oil and gas production with far‐reaching implications for all the companies that produce these fuels.” Mitchell points to Germany, which has been forced into short-term fixes to bridge its energy supply crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Despite the country’s multi-trillion-dollar green energy transition plans, 53.7% of all German power last year ‘came from conventional sources such as coal, gas and nuclear power,’” Mitchell wrote, quoting another source. Mitchell didn’t write that Germany retains its target to have 80% of all electricity generation come from renewables by 2030 and the amount of electricity consumed in Germany from renewables has climbed from about 10% in 2004 to about 47% now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/mar/03/putin-oligarchs-uk-slow-at-acting","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-03T18:59:21Z","webTitle":"Why does the UK seem so slow at acting against Putin’s oligarchs?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/03/putin-oligarchs-uk-slow-at-acting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/mar/03/putin-oligarchs-uk-slow-at-acting","fields":{"headline":"Why does UK seem so slow at acting against Putin’s oligarchs?","bodyText":"The world has watched as France and Germany have seized superyachts to prevent their oligarch owners evading sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine. Yet – to the bemusement of allies – in Britain it is still legal for many Kremlin-linked businessmen to sell their assets. MPs from the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, to Conservative party backbenchers lined up on Wednesday to ask Boris Johnson why the government has not yet personally targeted many of the individuals who have grown rich under Vladimir Putin. In private, EU governments are also trying to work out why the UK has been slow to act, and Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s first vice-president on Thursday hinted at the frustrations in public. Johnson has promised to publish a list of people in Britain deemed to have links with Putin’s regime, while the cabinet minister Michael Gove is reported to be in favour of seizing homes and offering them as housing to Ukrainian refugees. On Thursday evening the UK Foreign Office announced sanctions against Alisher Usmanov, the billionaire formerly linked to British football clubs, and Igor Shuvalov, a former deputy prime minister of Russia. Both have been linked to expensive properties in London. Yet signs of any further concrete action against the oligarchs are limited. What are the reasons why the government may be dragging its feet? Political neglect There is a persistent sense among anti-corruption experts that exposing dirty money flowing through the UK – and particularly through London – is not a high political priority. “Even without the invasion, with Russia I think this government has been caught on the back foot,” said Tom Keatinge, a financial crime expert at the thinktank Rusi. “I just think it is something the prime minister has not ever thought he needed to focus on.” Whitehall sources stress there is now significant political will to change the UK’s status as a haven for oligarchs – including internal pressure from senior cabinet ministers. But the Conservative party will also be mindful of how it has benefited from Russian largesse – most recently £80,000 from Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former Putin minister. Chernukhin has denounced the invasion. The Conservative party chair, Ben Elliot, runs a luxury concierge service whose marketing has offered to help Russians buy property in London and find elite private schools. Legal threats from oligarchs Sanctions are a powerful weapon, but oligarchs can challenge them with expensive lawyers – at least, from those solicitors who can stomach reputational damage. Meanwhile, billionaire oligarchs have a huge incentive to spend whatever necessary to have sanctions removed. “There’s not equality of arms,” said Bill Browder, a US financier turned anti-corruption campaigner. He describes UK law enforcement as risk averse. “In my experience over the last 10 years I’ve seen that the UK law enforcement capabilities when it comes to economic crime are at the bottom of the league table in this part of the world,” he said. The government has brought in “unexplained wealth orders” to force suspects to explain their wealth or else face confiscation, but has so far only used them against four people. One attempt ended in failure, with a court in 2020 rejecting an order against relatives of a former president of Kazakhstan. Lack of skills and resources Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said on Monday that the UK has a “hitlist” of oligarchs, and that the Foreign Office had hired extra lawyers and tripled the number of people in the sanctions department. But there is widespread internal frustration that preparatory work for legal cases against a number of individuals has only just now begun, after months of warning about a Russian invasion. Labour’s foreign affairs spokesperson, David Lammy, said the small number of sanctioned oligarchs was “totally unacceptable” a week after Russia’s invasion started. “Ministers had months to prepare for this eventuality, with the full support of parliament,” he said. UK caution The Russian invasion has been the first new test of the sanctions regime since the UK left the EU. There is some evidence that the evidentiary standard the UK was applying was slightly higher than the EU. Government sources have blamed additional barriers brought in after a proposed amendment to sanctions law in 2018, by crossbench peer Lord Pannick, which they claim added an additional evidence burden. It meant ministers had to apply a proportionality test and give individuals reasons why they had had sanctions placed on them. But Pannick told the Guardian there was little material difference with the EU regime, a view shared by other legal experts. The UK seems to be taking a more cautious legal approach regardless, which one Whitehall source put down to the newness of the system. Jasper Helder, a sanctions expert at Akin Gump, a US law firm, said: “The FCDO, they want to be careful that they have the appropriate evidence to support the correct application of designation authority.” Open for business Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who has campaigned for tougher corruption laws, linked the slow action on sanctioning oligarchs to the UK allowing itself to “become a jurisdiction of choice for kleptocrats”. Hodge said she believed that the government had been swayed against tougher action by the City, anxious to avoid extra costs and, in some cases, lost business. Parts of the financial services sector are “not just colluding with but facilitating dirty money”, Hodge said. The broader services sector has also come under scrutiny. Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property expert, said: “We have historically made it too easy for people to own property without stepping into the sunshine.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/kyiv-diary-russia-ukraine-invasion-first-week","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T12:46:14Z","webTitle":"‘My son is brave, but he’s scared’: Kyiv father’s diary of first week of invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/kyiv-diary-russia-ukraine-invasion-first-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/kyiv-diary-russia-ukraine-invasion-first-week","fields":{"headline":"‘My son is brave, but he’s scared’: Kyiv father’s diary of first week of invasion","bodyText":"24 February – the day of the invasion The first day of the [Russian] invasion [of Ukraine] was my 15th wedding anniversary. We had planned a party with friends and had booked a table in a restaurant. But early morning, around 5am, my family – my wife and my 10-year-old son – were woken by Russian rockets flying over our house. The first thought was to grab everything we could and leave. But all the roads were blocked with traffic, and they were shelling us all the time. It was terrifying. So we went to a nearby underground car park and spent the whole day there. There were about 60 people there on the first day. It was cold, there was no heating and people were lying on the floor. Occasionally we dashed back to the apartment to get supplies – we live on the 14th floor and the elevator was still working – that first day we were eating things like cookies and crisps, anything you could grab in a second. We slept in the car park in our car. My son was in the back seat, my wife and I in the front, half sitting and half lying down. I am almost 2 metres (6ft 6in) tall so it wasn’t very comfortable. We tried to think about our anniversary – about the wonderful 15 years we had together, that we have a God-blessed 10-year-old son whom we love very much. But that first day – it was just about fear. 25 February Waking up in the car felt horrible, my back was aching like never before. In the morning the bombing was quiet – well, almost quiet. The meaning of the word “quiet” was changing – when you hear only two explosions, instead of 10. We went home and quickly ate porridge for breakfast. Ukrainians are friendly people and we know almost all of our neighbours very well. So we started to organise getting food and water for those who couldn’t – filling up water bottles in the apartment, fetching food, making a space in the car park for women with children to feed and change them in privacy. We weighed up leaving, but the traffic was still very bad. And we were thinking maybe this madness would stop. That night we slept underground again. 26 February The third day some friends got sick from the cold in the car park and we decided to return to our apartment and try to live normally – take a shower, cook meals, give lessons to our son and get him playing online chess. We taped our windows. The elevator was no longer working. My son’s a very brave boy. He’s trying not to cry. He’s trying to help. But every time the siren sounds from outside the window, and we have to run downstairs to the shelter again, I can see he’s scared. But he doesn’t panic. That day I was standing with a neighbour outside in our yard. Suddenly we heard gunshots from automatic rifles close by. Later I read the news via Telegram that Russian troops were trying to infiltrate the city. It said they were liquidated. At the moment you hear gunfire, you’re not afraid – you don’t have time to be afraid, you just have to get your son to safety in the car park. The shock comes a little later, when you realise you could have been killed. Or worse, your wife and child could be killed and you survive. 27 February By Sunday, some of the small neighbourhood shops had opened again. This war has transformed our reality – an open shop or gas station felt like a return to normal life. But when you queue there’s a real possibility you may be killed. Inside the store, there were only a few supplies. But the shelves weren’t empty, thanks to previous customers, thinking about those still queueing. I shared the food between our family and other people in the car park. The numbers had now grown to about 150. I started to organise more supplies for everyone: food, water, toilet paper. That night in our apartment we phoned everyone to check they are safe. My wife and son slept in our bedroom, and I slept in my son’s room. His part of the building is closer to the siren. To make sure I hear it, I left the window open while I slept – well, you can’t really call it sleep. You just lie with your eyes closed. You sleep fully dressed next to a bag with documents and food. Everybody here is exhausted. 28 February On Monday some of the big stores in the city were open for a few hours. I took my car to fill up on supplies. I went alone and I stayed on speakerphone with my wife, and she continuously tracked my location from my phone. Every time I was stopped at a roadblock to get my documents checked, I asked our soldiers, “What do you need?” I brought them things like cigarettes and water. It’s my thanks to these people who defend us, defend Ukraine, standing 24/7 outside in the cold with no sleep. Ukraine is tiny compared with Russia and our army is much smaller. But the braveness of people here, and how they have shown they are ready to defend the country until the last breath, gives me hope. 1 March When I was driving back from getting gas on Tuesday, my wife phoned me. “We can see smoke coming from the Holocaust memorial complex,” she said. I was absolutely devastated. I am Jewish. My father is 83 and survived the Holocaust, which killed half my family. We went to the memorial very often because I wanted my son to know the history. My father has memories of running across a field to get away from bombs. Now, my son has to do the same, but it’s not Hitler, it’s Putin who is bombing us. I was completely shocked and depressed. It’s no secret that our president in Ukraine is a Jew. We all support our president, we are very proud of him. I know people in Russia. Half of them are not my friends any more. A couple of them tried to tell me it was us who started this war. I just blocked them; I don’t want to read the crap they are writing. Russian TV has washed their brains – as a friend told me, “it’s not TV, it’s radiation”. 2 March On Wednesday the Russians told us you better leave Kyiv. My wife and I were still thinking about whether to go. There were two things stopping us. First, her parents are in Chernihiv. We were desperately trying to get them out, out of that hell – so they could come with us. And second, I still wanted to help people here. I’m a very peaceful person. The only way I would fight is if they come to my home – I will defend my family. At this point, I was doing my best to help the people who defend us and those who need help. We realised if we decided to leave for western Europe, where we have family, we needed different clothes, not the skiing jackets and winter clothes we packed on the first day. As the elevator was still broken, I had to lug four suitcases up the stairs to the 14th floor, one by one. 3 March We finally made the decision to go. I was nervous, but after Putin’s conversation with Macron on Thursday, and hearing about his aim to control all of Ukraine, we now understood that he won’t stop until he ruins all this country. We were not prepared to live in Putin’s Russia. But mostly, the decision was about the safety of my son and wife. We didn’t want him to see the war any more, to wake up and be afraid of bombing and tanks. He was very sad about leaving without his grandparents. We didn’t want to leave them either, but we needed to take care of our son."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/nov/04/brexit-interest-rates-rishi-sunak-immigration-uk-economy-uk-politics-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T17:10:28Z","webTitle":"UK rail strikes suspended as RMT says employers ‘seeing sense’ and talks intensifying – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/nov/04/brexit-interest-rates-rishi-sunak-immigration-uk-economy-uk-politics-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/nov/04/brexit-interest-rates-rishi-sunak-immigration-uk-economy-uk-politics-live-news","fields":{"headline":"UK rail strikes suspended as RMT says employers ‘seeing sense’ and talks intensifying – as it happened","bodyText":"A series of planned strikes from Saturday by railway workers have been suspended, the RMT union has announced. Downing Street has said plans to build a new nuclear power plant in Suffolk have not been scrapped as part of a drive to make sweeping government spending cuts. Nicola Sturgeon has “utterly” refuted allegations that a decision to award a major ferries contract to an ally of the Scottish government was “jobs for the boys”. Fresh elections for the Northern Ireland assembly have been put back to the new year amid claims that the EU and the UK are close to agreement on some elements of the controversial Brexit arrangements that have caused a Democratic Unionist party (DUP) boycott of Stormont. Sir Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, has defended his claim that the UK economy has shrunk from being 90% the size of Germany’s to 70% the size of it since Brexit. See 9.25am. Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, has said the former prime minister Boris Johnson had the backing of enough MPs to mount a challenge to Rishi Sunak in last month’s leadership contest. Boris Johnson has accepted another £10,000 of accommodation from the Bamford family, taking their contributions to his lifestyle to almost £50,000 since he resigned as Conservative leader. Rishi Sunak praised the king’s long record as an environmental campaigner in the speech he gave at the Cop27 reception at Buckingham Palace earlier. According to PA Media, Sunak paid tribute to Charles for “helping to find practical solutions to climate change and biodiversity loss for more than 50 years, long before Cop1 let alone Cop27”. He added: The reduction in global emissions pledged during our presidency is now equivalent to more than six times the annual emissions of the entire global aviation industry. Sunak said perhaps the greatest breakthrough of the UK’s presidency of Cop26 was an idea suggested by Charles – bringing together leading investors and businesses at Glasgow to direct the world’s wealth at protecting the climate. He went on: As a result of what many of you here are doing today, we’re turning the fight against climate change into a fantastic source of new green jobs and growth. Charles ended the day by planting a lime tree in Buckingham Palace’s garden as part of the Queen’s Green Canopy project – thought to be the first time he has carried out a tree-planting ceremony as monarch. The initiative has planted more than a million trees across the UK to honour and celebrate the Queen’s 70 years of service to the nation. Mark Harper, the new transport secretary, has described the RMT’s decision to suspend rail strikes as “positive news”. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies, has also warned that rail services tomorrow and on Monday are set to be very disrupted. A spokesperson for the group said: It is positive that the RMT leadership have stepped back from the brink and called off their strike action. Unfortunately, the late notice means that while train companies are working hard to reinstate services, they will remain severely disrupted for our passengers tomorrow and into the early part of next week. Our advice remains to please check before you travel and on Saturday and Monday; only travel by rail if necessary. We remain committed to intensive negotiations to agree the reforms needed to improve reliability, deliver a pay rise for our people and get the industry back on a sustainable financial footing. Network Rail has said that, even though the RMT has called off tomorrow’s strike, services will be “extremely limited” because rail companies have already planned for disruption. Services on Monday are also likely to be very limited, it says. Tim Shoveller, Network Rail’s chief negotiator, said: It’s welcome news that the RMT has called off its strikes but the very late notice means that services for tomorrow cannot be reinstated and will remain extremely limited, and while we, and our train company partners, will work without pause over the weekend, there will be limited ability to change the ‘strike timetable’ for Monday. Our advice remains to please check before you travel and on Saturday and Monday and only travel by rail if absolutely necessary. We look forward to getting back round the table with all our trade unions early next week to see if the progress made this week can be built on, and a resolution found. The RMT rail union has announced that it has suspended strikes planned for tomorrow (5 November), Monday (7 November) and Wednesday (9 November). In a news release it said: RMT suspends strikes after securing intensive negotiations with rail bosses. Rail union RMT has suspended planned strikes on Nov 5, 7 and 9 and will now enter into a period of intensive negotiations with Network Rail and the train operating companies. Through a strong industrial campaign so far, RMT has secured unconditional talks on Network Rail and the promise of an offer from the train operating companies who, up until this point, have made no offer of any kind to our members. Originally Network Rail was intent on imposing changes to maintenance without agreement with RMT. And Mick Lynch, the RMT general secretary, said: The threat of strike action and our strongly supported industrial campaign has made the rail employers see sense. We have always wanted to secure a negotiated settlement and that is what we will continue to push for in this next phase of intensive talks. Our priority is our members, and we are working towards securing a deal on job security, a decent pay rise and good working conditions. Our re-ballot remains live and if we have to take strike action during the next six months to secure a deal, we will. The suggestion that the Ferguson Marine ferries contract represented “jobs for the boys” is categorically untrue, Nicola Sturgeon insisted as she faced MSPs looking into the procurement of two overdue and over-budget vessels. As PA Media reports, the first minister said she has “deep regret” about the impact on island communities the delay to the ferries entering service is having, as she gave evidence to the public audit committee at Holyrood for almost two hours this morning. Sturgeon said she was not aware of any impropriety in the procurement process, but she labelled allegations made in a recent BBC documentary as “serious”. The auditor general is examining allegations the yard was in possession of a lengthy document of technical specifications before its bid was submitted – giving it an advantage over firms pitching for the contract. The committee’s deputy convener, Tory MSP Sharon Dowey, asked Sturgeon: Was there an interest from the Scottish government to award the contract to FMEL (Ferguson Marine)? Was it a kind of ‘jobs for the boys’? There’s obviously been talk of a kind of relationship between the Scottish government and [owner] Jim McColl. McColl was pro-independence in 2014, and sits on Sturgeon’s council of economic advisers. Sturgeon said ‘jobs for the boys’ was a pejorative term which “I completely and utterly refute”. She said: If you are saying was there anything untoward in this procurement process in order to somehow inappropriately steer this contract towards FMEL, then absolutely, categorically not. As my colleague Severin Carrell explains in a story previewing Sturgeon’s appearance at the committee, the two ferries were due to enter service in 2018 at a cost of £97m. Now they are at least five years late, and set to cost at least £240m. The king has welcomed world leaders, business figures, environmentalists and NGOs to Buckingham Palace for a reception ahead of the UN climate summit Cop27, PA Media says. PA says: Charles will miss the gathering of world figures in Egypt next week but is likely to discuss issues around Cop27 and climate change with those invited to his royal residence. Rishi Sunak was among a small group of guests who met the king in a separate room before the main reception was held in the ballroom and the prime minister gave a short address to those invited. In the state dining room were leading figures including Labour leader Keir Starmer and governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey. Among those invited were Sir Pascal Soriot, chief executive AstraZeneca, former New York mayor and business news mogul Mike Bloomberg, yachtswoman Dame Ellen MacArthur whose foundation is working to tackle climate change and designer and environmental activist Stella McCartney. McCartney was with Sunak in the first group to meet the king, with the designer giving Charles a kiss which he returned and the trio joked as she curtsied after the introductions. Sunak revealed how he saw a lot of the daughter of Beatle Sir Paul McCartney as their children went to the same school. Charles thanked them for attending the event and the prime minister replied: “It’s all about what you’ve done.” Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, has said that Chris Philp’s comment about it being “a bit of a cheek” for asylum seekers coming to the UK “illegally” to complain shows “shocking” complacency about what has been happening at Manston migration centre. Carmichael said: Chris Philp’s comments reveal a shocking and callous complacency over the disaster unfolding at Manston. It is unbelievable that as we hear reports of sexual assaults, disease, and chronic overcrowding, his response is to accuse those who complain of ‘cheek’. Rather than dismissing the problem he should start to show some leadership. People have had enough of the endless evasion, chaos and incompetence we have seen from the government on this issue. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, says that fact that Gavin Williamson is subject to a misconduct complaint (see 11.39am) shows that Rishi Sunak’s judgment was flawed when he gave him a government job. In a statement Rayner said: These new revelations raise fresh questions about Rishi Sunak’s woeful judgment in resurrecting ministers who left government under a cloud of misconduct. Gavin Williamson was sacked from cabinet twice, yet despite risking national security he has now been put at the heart of the government’s corporate headquarters. Given his new role and the seriousness of these allegations, there must be an urgent and independent investigation. Far from restoring integrity, professionalism, and accountability, Rishi Sunak is failing to stop the rot. He promised that appointing an independent ethics adviser would be one of the first things he would do as prime minister, but instead he has given us more of the same old sleaze. And here are some more lines from the No 10 lobby briefing. The spokesperson refused to endorse what Chris Philp, the Home Office minister, said this morning about it being “a bit of a cheek” for asylum seekers coming to the UK “illegally” to complain about the conditions in which they were being held. Asked if Philp was speaking on behalf of the government on this point, the spokesperson said he had not spoken to the PM specifically about this. But he said the government was working hard to provide asylum seekers with safe and secure accommodation, and that they deserved to be treated “with compassion and respect”. The spokesperson said that 1,200 asylum seekers have been removed from the Manston immigration processing centre in the last four days. But he said there were still 2,600 people at the site, which is only meant to accommodate 1,600 people. The spokesperson said Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, has written to MPs with an update on plans to open new immigration removal centres at Haslar in Hampshire and Campsfield in Oxford. He said: These new facilities will provide safe, secure accommodation, with dedicated health facilities on site, and will play an important role in efforts to control our borders, process cases and remove those with no right to be in the UK, and ensure people going through our asylum system are treated with compassion, dignity and respect. The spokesperson refused to concede that Brexit was a factor behind people in the UK having to face higher interest rates. Asked if Mark Carney was right to say in his Today interview this morning that it was a factor (see 9.25am), the spokesperson replied: What we are seeing is challenges caused by the pandemic and war in Europe, which have been driving factors in terms of inflation, and we are seeing high inflation in a number of countries around the world. Asked if he was denying that Brexit was a factor, the spokesperson replied: There are a number of variables that have an impact, and what we are continuing to see is a number of countries face similar challenges when it comes to high inflation. The spokesperson also said the government was now focused on ensuring stability and fiscal credibility, and not on “decisions taken a number of years ago, where people made a clear decision”. The Downing Street lobby briefing is over, and the prime minister’s spokesperson has just shot down reports that the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant could be shelved. This morning the BBC was leading the news with a story saying this was an option. A government official told Simon Jack, the BBC’s business editor: “We are reviewing every major project – including Sizewell C.” But either the government official was misinformed, or a hasty rethink took place this morning, because when the PM’s spokesperson was asked at lobby if the government was scrapping Sizewell C, he replied: “No.” He went on: I’ve seen some reporting on that, but it is not accurate to say we are scrapping it. Our position on Sizewell C has not changed. It remains crucial to ending our reliance on fossil fuels, increasing our energy security and meeting our net zero ambitions. Asked if the project could be delayed, the spokesperson said: We hope to get a deal over the line as soon as possible. There are negotiations are ongoing. Negotiations have been constructive. The spokesperson also said the project was not being reviewed. He said the government had already committed £700m to the deal. I will post more from the lobby briefing shortly. Conservative MPs who spoke in the Commons on Monday when Suella Braverman, the home secretary, gave a statement about asylum seekers were generally supportive. But many of them still have reservations about her, and this morning Selaine Saxby said she was “on the fence” when asked to give an assessment of Braverman. In an interview on Times Radio, asked to say on a scale of 1 to 10 how confident she was that Braverman would get a grip on the problems being caused by people arriving in small boats across the Channel, Saxby said: “I’m going to sit on the fence on that and say I hope very much that there is much work going on very rapidly to address the situation.” Saxby represents North Devon, and she is particularly concerned about a hotel in Illfracombe being requisitioned for asylum seekers, even though she says she was told by the Home Office two weeks ago this would not happen. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, says it would be a mistake for the government to shelve plans for the Sizewell C nuclear power plant. Referring to reports claiming the project could be delayed or scrapped, Miliband said: If the government turns its back on this project, they will be breaking all of the promises they have made and undermining our vital nuclear industry. One of the reasons we are facing an energy bills crisis is 12 years of failed Conservative energy policy, including a decade of drift and delay on new nuclear power. Their short-sightedness has been staggering – from closing storage facilities, to failing to insulate houses, to delaying on nuclear, and to blocking cheap, homegrown renewable power. Rishi Sunak held a call with his Japanese counterpart, Fumio Kishida, this morning. Here is an extract from the No 10 readout. Both leaders condemned the recent North Korean missile launches, and the prime minister said it was vital the international community remained closely coordinated on the best way forward. Turning to trade, both prime ministers shared the view that the Pacific trade bloc, CPTPP, was an important framework and the UK’s accession offered a unique opportunity to support prosperity across the world. Discussing progress on the UK’s future combat air system, the leaders agreed that deeper cooperation on the next-generation fighter jet programme would underline the close relationship between the two nations. After the appointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary, the most surprising feature of Rishi Sunak’s reshuffle was his decision to bring back Gavin Williamson as a minister without portfolio in the Cabinet Office, with the right to attend cabinet. Williamson was an effective chief whip for Theresa May. But he was not a success either as defence secretary or education secretary, and he has made enemies in the parliamentary party on account of his penchant for plotting and scheming. A survey this week showed that, among Tory members, he is by a wide margin the lowest-rated minister attending cabinet. According to Cat Neilan from Tortoise, an official complaint about Williamson has now been submitted to CCHQ by Wendy Morton, who was chief whip under Liz Truss. She claims he sent her threatening messages. He denies this. Sinn Féin has accused the UK government of “fuelling political instability” after it shelved plans for new Northern Ireland elections before Christmas. There were elections in May, but they did not result in a power-sharing executive being set up because the DUP is boycotting the process because of its opposition to the Northern Ireland protocol. By law, after six months without an executive (that deadline fell on 28 October), the UK government has to hold a new election within 12 weeks. At one point Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, said he would announce a poll “at one minute past midnight” after 28 October, leading to speculation the election would happen in December But Heaton-Harris hesitated and this morning he said there will be no election before Christmas. He has not altogether ruled out having an election before the 19 January deadline, but his announcement will increase speculation that the government will pass emergency legislation to remove the requirement for an election – something that has happened before in Northern Ireland when the executive has been suspended. The political parties in Northern Ireland have generally welcomed the decision, saying an election would not have resolved the stalemate, but Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland, and first minister designate, said the decision was prolonging instability. She said: Today’s announcement is more dithering and indecision from the British secretary of state and a continuation of the Tory chaos in London that is now paralysing our politics. Chris Heaton-Harris met with political parties this week and failed to give any indication of what he announced today. Instead, he has confirmed the bizarre U-turn he made last week but once again he provides no clarity or certainty on what his next steps even are. The British government are fuelling the political instability caused by the DUP’s failure to recognise the result of the May election when the people voted for change. The British government and the DUP are leaving us in a prolonged state of political limbo with no assembly, executive or caretaker ministers. This is totally unacceptable at a time when workers, families and small businesses are struggling through the cost of living crisis and a cold winter, and when our health service needs immediate investment. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, responded to the news with a tweet restating his call for the Northern Ireland protocol to be replaced. Chris Philp was giving interviews this morning on behalf of the government in his capacity as the policing minister in the Home Office. When Liz Truss was prime minister, he was chief secretary to the Treasury, but he was demoted by Rishi Sunak. In his interview with BBC Breakfast, Philp was asked about his previous job and whether he would apologise for his role in the disastrous mini-budget. He declined. But he also implied that Truss herself, rather than Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, was primarily to blame for what happened. He told the programme: The decisions around the mini-budget were taken principally by the then prime minister and to a lesser extent the then chancellor. Kwarteng, who was chancellor at the time of the mini budget, has not talked publicly since he was sacked by Truss about whether he thinks she was primarily to blame, or he was. But it has been reported that he was cautious about abolishing the 45% top rate of tax in the mini budget, and that she insisted the measure should be included. (It was the first mini-budget measure to be abandoned). Interestingly, in an interview shortly before he became chancellor, Kwarteng said he believed the Treasury should be “constitutionally subordinate” to No 10. Speaking to Harry Cole and James Heale for their Truss biography, he also criticised Rishi Sunak for not deferring to the prime minister. Kwarteng said: In the meetings I was in, they were very much superior, the Treasury, they were the numbers people, they were the details people, and they indulged, they humoured the prime minister. I don’t know whether they ran rings around him; they were very rude and the special advisers were very rude and they didn’t give him any deference or respect. Kwarteng contrasted Sunak with Philip Hammond, chancellor under Theresa May, who, he said, had the “maturity” to see that May was ultimately in charge because “the prime minister was the person who won the leadership, she was head of the government”. Chris Philp, a Home Office minister, has said it is “a bit of a cheek” for people who he said had “entered the UK illegally” to complain about conditions. My colleague Jamie Grierson has the full story here. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, has welcomed the UK government’s decision not to call an election in Nothern Ireland before Christmas. Our story about the no early election announcement is here. Good morning. Last month, in an interview with the Financial Times, Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, added to the considerable evidence about the harm done by Brexit to the UK economy with a striking statistic. He told the FT: In 2016 the British economy was 90% the size of Germany’s. Now it is less than 70%. This figure was widely quoted on social media, but it was also strongly contested, even by economists who accept that Brexit has held back the UK economy. One of the most prominent critics was Jonathan Portes, a former government economist who is now a professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, who described it as a “zombie statistic” and “nonsense”. He said Carney was measuring the size of the two economies according to the prevailing exchange rates. But he said the normal method for comparing economies was to use “purchasing power parity”. (Put crudely, this is a measure that tries to evaluate how rich Britain is not by looking at how much stuff we could buy if we took our pounds and went to the US or China, but by how much stuff we could buy if we spent it in the UK.) Portes told the Daily Mail last month: The pound has risen by almost 10% against the dollar since the Truss nadir. Has the UK economy really grown by almost 10% relative to the US in a few weeks? Similarly, Carney is choosing a date when the pound was abnormally high against the euro (January 2016), another one when the pound was much lower, and then saying we’ve underperformed Germany by 20%. That’s just obvious complete nonsense. If you look at actual annual growth rate in domestic currency, the UK and Germany have grown by quite similar amounts since 2016. But this morning, in an interview on the Today programme, Carney defended his use of the 70% figure. He said the value of the pound started to fall when the referendum was called, it went down sharply when the result was announced and “it hasn’t recovered”. Carney accepted that there was a difference between the purchasing power parity exchange rate and the market exchange rate. The market exchange rate was what ultimately mattered, he said, because it affected the UK’s ability to buy goods from abroad. He went on: It’s relatively rare that you get big differences between the two [exchange rates]. But you get them when you have a long-standing shock to productivity in the economy and that is unfortunately what we’re getting in the UK. It was predicted that we would get that. It is coming to pass. And … it is one of the issues the Bank of England is facing. This is what we said [before Brexit] was going to happen, which is that the exchange rate would go down, it would stay down, that would add to inflationary pressure, the economy’s capacity would go down for a period of time because of Brexit, that would add to inflationary pressure, and we would have a situation – which is the situation we have today – where the Bank of England has to raise interest rates despite the fact that the economy is going into recession. Carney said that he and Portes had a “difference of opinion” on this. But, Carney said, in his view what mattered was “the purchasing ability, the international weight of the economy”. And that has shrunk, he argued. Another way to put it is that that structural shift is in part what the government, and all of us, are dealing with in the UK. We’ve had a big hit to our productivity, our capacity in the economy … and we have to take some tough decisions in order to get it back up. And that’s one of the consequences of a decision taken a few years ago. It is worth focusing on this because it is relatively quiet at Westminster. But in other stories this morning, Sir Graham Brady, chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, has in effect confirmed that Boris Johnson did have enough support to make it on to the ballot for the latest Tory leadership contest. And the government has indicated that plans to build a new nuclear power plant in Suffolk are under review and could be delayed or scrapped.

It comes as a parliamentary committee warned historical breaches of the code may never be investigated or resolved, including the conduct of the home secretary or Islamophobia claims against a former chief whip. Rishi Sunak has launched a hunt for a new adviser on ministerial interests but the Guardian reported last week several candidates have turned down the role. Sunak is not offering any enhanced powers – which means advisers would not be able to launch their own investigations. The ethics adviser, when appointed, would probably face calls to renew or open at least two complex investigations – including concluding one into alleged Islamophobic comments made by the then chief whip, Mark Spencer, to the Conservative MP Nusrat Ghani. There will also probably be pressure to open an investigation into the home secretary, Suella Braverman, who was sacked for a potential security breach by Liz Truss though reinstated by Sunak. In a new report, the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, said it would be concerning if the prime minister’s new adviser was not allowed to examine historical cases. It suggests the inquiry into allegations of racism towards Ghani will not be concluded, which the committee says is “unsatisfactory”. It recommends that former ministers and civil servants who break the rules regulating the “revolving door” between government and private sector jobs should face legal action, to act as a “sufficient deterrent” for improper conduct. It said primary legislation should be introduced to establish the independent adviser as a statutory position and they should retain the power to initiate investigations and complete any legacy inquiries they inherit. The committee’s chair, the Conservative MP William Wragg, said: “Our inquiry has found that although we have a sophisticated landscape of ethics watchdogs in the UK to safeguard standards in public life, they lack the power to enforce the rules. The prime minister is rightly the ultimate arbiter of the rules in our system. We urge him to show leadership and give legal status to all the ethics watchdogs.” The pressure group Transparency International has been among those calling for the role to have significantly enhanced powers since it was vacated by Christopher Geidt five months ago under Boris Johnson. In analysis of media reports, the group found 40 potential breaches of the ministerial code have not been investigated over the past five years. Those included: Meetings by Nadhim Zahawi and Kwasi Kwarteng with the Libyan politician Fathi Bashagha, organised by the lobbyist Mark Fullbrook who became Truss’s chief of staff. Michael Gove’s acceptance of £120,000 in donations from property developers while chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster with oversight of the Cabinet Office. Multiple meetings held by Anne-Marie Trevelyan with a Chinese state-owned nuclear power company with no record of what was discussed. All the ministers have claimed donations and meetings were recorded accurately, but Transparency International said each one represented a potential breach that should be investigated where a perceived conflict of interest could arise. The group has also called for appointments to the role to be made with a competitive process and for the position to be defined in law – rather than both being at the whim of the prime minister. Daniel Bruce, the chief executive of Transparency International UK, said: “This is further evidence the conventions-based system that is supposed to uphold standards in high-office is simply not fit for purpose. The extent of potential misconduct at the heart of government may be a shock to many, but equally concerning should be the lack of transparency over why these cases were never investigated independently.” Sir Alex Allan, a former independent adviser, resigned after Boris Johnson refused to take action after an investigation into bullying by the then-home secretary Priti Patel. Truss, during her short tenure as prime minister, expressed no interest in appointing a successor to Geidt. No transparency data on ministers’ interests has been published since May, despite multiple changes of government including three prime ministers. While Sunak searches for Geidt’s successor, a separate independent investigation has been launched into the conduct of the deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, by the senior employment barrister Adam Tolley KC, who is examining three bullying complaints. A government spokesperson said: “We have been clear that this government will have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level and have committed to appointing an independent adviser on ministerial interests. This process is ongoing.” This article was amended on 2 December 2022. Michael Gove accepted £120,000 in donations while chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, not as housing secretary, as an earlier version stated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/19/ukraines-coming-winter-looks-colder-after-russia-targets-energy-supply","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-19T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"Ukraine’s coming winter looks colder after Russia targets energy supply","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/19/ukraines-coming-winter-looks-colder-after-russia-targets-energy-supply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/19/ukraines-coming-winter-looks-colder-after-russia-targets-energy-supply","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine’s coming winter looks colder after Russia targets energy supply","bodyText":"It is a grim warning. While attention has been focused on the civilian casualties and chaos caused by Russia’s renewed bombing of Kyiv and other major cities, its impact on the country’s energy supply has not been quantified until today. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that 30% of the country’s power stations had been knocked out in just eight days, an astonishing proportion in a short amount of time with blackouts occurring in the east of the capital. At one point Ukraine, connected to the European grid, was an energy exporter, partly because of its large nuclear power stations. But with the Zaporizhzhia plant, seized by the Russians, already shut down, the surplus, the president acknowledged earlier this month, had gone. Now, Ukrainians need to prepare for “rolling blackouts” and people will have to conserve energy, the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, warned on national television on Thursday. The country needed, he added, to be prepared for “a hard winter”. Politicians in Ukraine have been warning for months now that Russia would target the energy grid in the run up to winter, where temperatures can drop to -10C and even -20C. In some frontline areas, such as Donbas, there are already no gas supplies for heating the apartment blocks where so many live. Quietly around the country there have been efforts to ensure hospitals and military sites have backup generators available. But it will not be enough for civilians and it is clear that the situation – and the bleak initial effectiveness of the Russian strategy – could make for a very difficult period. Some experts have feared there could even be a renewed migration crisis, as people seek to leave the country in pursuit of warmth. One international aid agency, which did not want to be named, estimated there could be as many as 2m people will want to leave on top of the 7.7m who have already done so. On Tuesday, Ukraine indicated that it believed that Russia’s new strategy was linked to an offer of peace talks by Vladimir Putin at the end of September, although that offer is seen by Kyiv as an attempt to stall the fighting to allow Russia to regroup and stabilise the frontlines until its fresh wave of conscripts arrive. Against such concerns, it is no wonder that Britain’s foreign and defence secretaries, James Cleverly and Ben Wallace, flew to Washington to discuss, among other things, a new military aid package to Ukraine, focusing on improving air defences. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s general secretary, said that help could come within days. Although the Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones are felt to have limited use on the battlefield, and around three-quarters are being shot down, clearly enough are getting through to affect power generation. Without an urgent supply of new weapons to tackle them, problems could worsen fast. However, ensuring the continuity of supply of electricity and warmth to the military has been a priority for Kyiv, while any frontline difficulties the Ukrainians face are likely to be shared by the Russian invaders too. That means it is civilians – and civilian morale – that will bear the brunt, a familiar Russian strategy to prioritise psychological effects over battlefield success – although it will almost certainly take a lot more than a cold, dark winter to dampen the broad Ukrainian desire to fight against the Russian invaders. But a Russian attempt to stoke a humanitarian crisis in the winter will also impose further costs on both Ukraine and its western supporters. The rapid success of the attacks on power stations suggest the coming months will be hard, unless an urgent military solution can be found."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-215-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-26T14:08:57Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 215 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-215-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-215-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 215 of the invasion","bodyText":"A Russian man has shot the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town after telling him he would refuse to fight in the war in Ukraine. The incident took place in the city of Ust-Ilimsk, a town of about 85,000 people in the Irkutsk region in Siberia. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. Reports say that at least three shots were fired. Protests against the Vladimir Putin’s partial military mobilisation order appeared to continue on Sunday in the Russian republic of Dagestan, with videos showing standoffs between police and the public. Video footage posted on social media showed police arresting demonstrators protesting against the order to draft 300,000 more Russians to the army for the war effort in Ukraine. Long queues of vehicles were at border crossing between Russia and Mongolia on Sunday as people continued to flee the Kremlin’s mobilisation order, AFP reported. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag told the agency that more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday. Sergei Tsekov, a member of Russia’s upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, has called for the Russian border to be shut “to ban anyone who is of military age from traveling abroad”. Ukraine’s armed forces general staff has claimed some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation are being sent directly to the frontlines in Ukraine without training. Amid warnings from the UK’s Ministry of Defence and other experts that many of those conscripted were likely to get little meaningful training – and faced the risk of “high rates of attrition” when deployed – men recently mobilised by pro-Russian occupation officials in Ukraine were also being readied for the frontline. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. The Russian news agency RIA Novosti is carrying some turnout figures for the widely derided “referendums” in occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson which began on Friday. The figures suggest that turnout has been sufficient for the proxy-Russian authorities to declare them legitimate, ranging from 77% in Donetsk to 49% in Kherson. Pro-Russian authorities have claimed that in Rubizhne in occupied Luhansk, a polling station had to be moved to a reserve location after shelling from Ukrainian forces hit the school where it was due to be held. Energoatom, the state-run nuclear enterprise in Ukraine which manages nuclear power stations including the occupied plant at Zaporizhzhia, has accused pro-Russian forces within Zaporizhzhia of staging the appearance that staff voted in the widely-condemned referendum being held in the region. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukraine’s mayor of Sievierodonetsk, has decried what he called the “lie and propaganda” of the “referendum from the Russian Federation”, accusing pro-Russian forces of bussing people in from Crimea to vote and to stage propaganda photographs. Serbia will not recognise Russian annexation “referendums” in occupied Ukrainian areas. The Serbian foreign minister, Nikola Selakovic, said the referendums “completely contradict our state and national interests, our policy of dealing with territorial integrity, sovereignty and the principle of inviolability of borders”. The UN’s atomic energy watchdog said it is ready to hold talks in Russia and Ukraine on setting up a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said he met the foreign minister from both countries at the UN general assembly last week to discuss the possibility of a protection zone. Two drones launched by Russian forces into the Odesa region in Ukraine hit military objects causing a fire and the detonation of ammunition. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to liberate the entire country as Russia pressed on with its supposed referendum in occupied areas of Ukraine and so-called election workers accompanied by masked gunmen knocked on doors to get people to vote. The Ukrainian president said the country’s armed forces would throw out Russia’s forces and retaliate against “every strike of the aggressor”. He vowed that Ukraine would regain control of the southern Kherson region and the eastern Donbas, saying: “Every murderer and torturer will be brought to justice.” Ukraine’s president renewed calls for western allies to cut Russian banks from Swift, the global banking system that allows banks to send messages to each other. “If we cut Russian banks from Swift, we need to cut all Russian banks from Swift,” he said. Zelenskiy has also claimed in a US television interview that Ukraine has discovered two more mass burial sites containing the bodies of hundreds of people in the north-eastern town of Izium. Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has said explicitly for the first time today that he had founded the Wagner mercenary group and confirmed its deployment to countries in Latin America and Africa. Moldova’s president Maia Sandu has said that her country may revoke the citizenship of those who go to fight for Russia in Ukraine. Belarus leader, Alexander Lukashenko, met Putin on Monday in Sochi. Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán has suggested he will hold a “national consultation” on EU sanctions against Russia, saying “The sanctions were introduced in an undemocratic way, because it was the decision of the bureaucrats in Brussels, for which the European people are paying. We need to know the opinion of the people. For the first time in Europe, in Hungary, we will ask for the opinion about sanctions.” Japan will ban exports of chemical weapons-related goods to Russia, and is “deeply concerned” about the possible use of nuclear weapons, chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Monday. The United States and its allies will act “decisively” if Russia uses a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the US national security adviser says, reaffirming the Biden White House’s previous response to mounting concerns that Vladimir Putin’s threats are in increased danger of being realised. Jake Sullivan told CBS on Sunday: “We have communicated directly, privately and at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the US and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail.” The UK prime minister, Liz Truss, has said its allies France and the US should continue to support Ukraine in the face of the Russian president’s increased threats and his military call-up. Truss said Vladimir Putin was escalating the war because he was not winning and had made a mistake. Thousands of Hassidic Jewish pilgrims flocked to central Ukraine to mark the Jewish new year on Sunday, ignoring international travel warnings as Russian forces attacked more targets from the air. The pilgrims, many travelling from Israel and farther afield, converged on the small city of Uman, the burial site of Nachman of Breslov, a respected Hassidic rabbi who died in 1810, Associated Press reported. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK has issued a plea for continued “generosity” and “patience” from those offering a home to refugees in Britain. Vadym Prystaiko said Ukraine needed “much more” help from the UK as the country fought Moscow’s invasion, with the Kremlin’s military call-up amounting to “something formidable”. Israel will treat 20 Ukrainian soldiers who have been injured in the war with Russia, according to the Israeli ambassador to Ukraine. The first two patients would arrive on Sunday for treatment at Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv, envoy Michael Brodsky said. Aiden Aslin, one of the five British nationals released by Russia last week, has given his first media interview after returning to the UK. He told the Sun on Sunday that he was kept in solitary confinement for five months and “treated worse than a dog”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2022/may/01/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-01T20:00:33Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/01/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/may/01/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• An article about the UK government’s new energy strategy said targets for onshore wind and solar power generation would be raised in a push for 95% of electricity to come from domestic renewable energy sources by 2030.

Here’s where things stand: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he is returning to Ukraine “with good results” after his visit to Washington. In his first video message after meeting with Joe Biden and addressing Congress, Zelenskiy thanked the US president “for his help, his international leadership, and his determination to win”. On Wednesday, the White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. President Zelenskiy met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday while returning to Ukraine from the US. Ukraine’s president posted a photo of the meeting on his Telegram and said the pair “summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war”. The two spoke “for a long time, almost two hours”, according to an aide for President Andrzej Duda. Zelenskiy gave a defiant address to a joint session of the US Congress on Wednesday after his meeting with President Biden, in which he said that Washington’s continued support is key to ultimate victory. His visit to the US – his first since Russia’s invasion of his country – came amid concern that the incoming Republican leadership of the House of Representatives might oppose proposals for an additional $45bn in weapons and other assistance next year. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Thursday. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin said the Patriot air defence that the US is supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. Answering a question on the possibility to end the war with Ukraine through diplomatic means, Putin said that “all armed conflicts end through negotiations”. The Kremlin said US supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine would not contribute to settling the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, and would not prevent Russia from achieving its goals. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there had been no signs of readiness for peace talks during Zelenskiy’s visit, and this was evidence the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia “to the last Ukrainian”. The Wagner Group, the Russian mercenary group answerable to Vladimir Putin, took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Moscow’s forces in Ukraine, according to the US. The US assessment, reported by Reuters and then confirmed by national security council spokesperson John Kirby, suggests the Wagner Group’s expanding role in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, condemned North Korea and said Putin’s turning to Pyongyang for weapons “is a sign of Russia’s desperation and isolation”. Russia’s chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said the frontline in Ukraine was stable. In an end-of-year message delivered to foreign military attaches and published by the defence ministry, Gerasimov said Moscow had concentrated its forces on “completing the liberation” of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has visited army units fighting in Ukraine, state media cited the ministry as saying. Shoigu visited Russian units deployed to the “area of the special military operation”, the state-owned news agency Ria reported, using Moscow’s term for the conflict in Ukraine. It did not specify where the visit took place. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed today in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”. It has not been possible to independently verify this report. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at Ukraine and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. Speaking at a conference of military leaders, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”. “If you want peace, prepare for war,” he added. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold a summit with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy early next year, according to an EU spokesperson. The summit will take place on 3 February but its location has not yet been determined. A fire broke out on Russia’s only aircraft carrier on Thursday, Russian state media reported. The Admiral Kuznetsov, a flagship of the Russian navy, suffered a “minor” fire while docked at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in the Arctic port of Murmansk, located in the far north-west of Russia, according to reports by the Russian state-owned Tass and Ria Novosti news agencies. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, met officials from Russia’s military and state atomic energy company, Rosatom, on Thursday to discuss setting up a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s chief, said more negotiations were needed after “another round of necessary discussions”. Rosatom described the talks on measures needed to safeguard the Zaporizhzhia facility and the surrounding region as “substantive, useful and frank”. The Ukrainian ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said the number of children who had been “forcibly deported” to Russia could be in the hundreds of thousands. Authorities had established the identity of more than 13,000 children deported to Russia, Lubinets said, adding that investigators had uncovered a cell inside a “torture chamber” in the recently liberated Kherson where children were allegedly detained and mistreated. German authorities said they arrested an employee of the country’s foreign intelligence service (BND) on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing information to Russia. The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L., was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen whom it suspects of spying for Russia. The Vladimir Putin called Israel’s prime minister-designate, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Thursday to congratulate him on forming a government and to discuss the situation in Ukraine, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Netanyahu told Putin “he hopes a way will be found quickly to end the war [with Ukraine] and the suffering caused by it”, it said. German authorities said they arrested an employee of the country’s foreign intelligence service (BND) on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing information to Russia. The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L., was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It said police also raided his flat and workplace as well as those of another person. The statement reads: The accused is suspected of state treason. In 2022, he shared information that he came by in the course of his work with a Russian intelligence agency. The content is considered a state secret. The man was brought today before a judge, who ordered him held in custody pending a possible indictment, prosecutors said. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen whom it suspects of spying for Russia. The suspect is the son of a former Russian spy who was once stationed in Germany and Austria as a diplomat, the Austrian interior ministry said on Monday. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he will be returning to Ukraine with ‘good results’. Ukraine’s president met with Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, hours after he visited the White House in a bid to keep American weapons supplies flowing for the war against Russia. The UK has condemned North Korea following claims by the US that the Russian mercenary group Wagner took delivery of an arms shipment from Pyongyang to bolster Moscow’s forces fighting in Ukraine. John Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, confirmed to reporters that North Korea has “completed an initial arms delivery to Wagner, which paid for that equipment”. Kirby added: Last month, North Korea delivered infantry rockets and missiles into Russia for use by Wagner. The US estimates that the Wagner Group has 50,000 personnel deployed in Ukraine, including 10,000 contractors and 40,000 convicts recruited from Russian prisons, he added. In a statement, Britain’s foreign secretary James Cleverly said: The fact that President Putin is turning to North Korea for help is a sign of Russia’s desperation and isolation. We will work with our partners to ensure that North Korea pays a high price for supporting Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said. In a statement, Blinken said: In the wake of Russian naval operations against Ukrainian ports, including those that are providing much-needed food and grain to the world, the United States today is imposing sanctions on Russian naval entities. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said. Four additional entities were targeted for operating in the marine sector of Russia’s economy, it said. Blinken’s statement continued: The United States remains determined to use all appropriate measures to deter Russia’s attacks on Ukraine – whether those attacks be from the air, land, or sea. These accountability measures underscore a simple message: the Kremlin must end its brutal campaign against Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he is returning to Ukraine “with good results” in his first video message after his visit to Washington. The Ukrainian leader thanked Joe Biden “for his help, his international leadership, and his determination to win” in a video posted on social media. He said: We are bringing to Ukraine, to Donbas, to Bakhmut and to the south the decisions that our Defense Forces have been waiting for. He added that he met with Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, on his way home today and thanked him “for everything they do for Ukraine and our protection – the protection of Europe”. President Vladimir Putin said the Patriot air defence that the US is supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. He said: An antidote will always be found…Russia will knock down the Patriot system. Answering a question on the possibility to end the war with Ukraine through diplomatic means, Putin said that “all armed conflicts end through negotiations”. He added: The sooner this becomes clear to Kyiv, the better. Putin further claimed that Russia has devastated the Ukrainian military-industrial complex, boasting that Russia’s military capabilities were “only growing”. Putin also said that Russia will next week announce a response to a price cap imposed by Western powers on sales of Russian oil. The Group of Seven (G7) nations will boost efforts to strengthen Ukraine’s air defence, Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. Speaking to reporters, Baerbock said: Every rocket that Ukraine takes out of the sky means a bit less suffering for the people in Ukraine. She also welcomed the decision by the US to deliver a Patriot air defence system to Ukraine. Meanwhile, a joint statement from G7 finance ministers said the group is “prepared to do more as needed on budget and economic support” for Ukraine in the year ahead. The G7 has mobilised “up to $32bn US dollars of budget and economic support for Ukraine and continue to make further progress”, it said. The Wagner Group, the Russian mercenary group answerable to Vladimir Putin, took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Moscow’s forces in Ukraine, according to the US. The US assessment, reported by Reuters and then confirmed by national security council spokesperson John Kirby, suggests the Wagner Group’s expanding role in Russia’s war in Ukraine. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters: We can confirm that North Korea has completed an initial arms delivery to Wagner, which paid for the equipment. Last month, North Korea delivered infantry rockets and missiles into Russia for use by Wagner. The amount of material delivered by North Korea will not change battlefield dynamics in Ukraine, the source said. But the US is “concerned that North Korea is planning to deliver more military equipment to Wagner”, they added. US officials believe the North Korean arms delivery is a direct violation of the UN’s security council resolutions, and plan to raise this with the council. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed today in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”. There was no immediate comment on the incident from Ukrainian authorities. It has not been possible to independently verify this report. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday while returning to Ukraine from the US. Ukraine’s president posted a photo of the meeting on his Telegram and said the pair “summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war”. The two spoke “for a long time, almost two hours”, according to an aide for President Andrzej Duda. President Zelenskiy’s meeting with President Duda came after the Ukrainian leader visited the White House in a bid to keep American weapons supplies flowing for the war against Russia. President Joe Biden promised Zelenskiy “you will never stand alone” and repeatedly affirmed the US’s commitment to Ukraine at a press conference after the two-hour meeting. On Wednesday, the White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. Zelenskiy gave a defiant address to a joint session of the US Congress after his meeting with President Biden, in which he said that Washington’s continued support is key to ultimate victory.

I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, here to take you through all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Here’s more on that meeting between the Ukrainian and Polish presidents, that took place earlier today as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was travelling back from Washington. The pair talked “for a long time, almost two hours”, an aide for President Andrzej Duda told Reuters. They added: First of all, about President Zelenskiy’s visit to the United States and the importance of the visit for support for Ukraine, but also about bilateral relations between Poland and Ukraine Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, while returning to Ukraine from the US. Zelenskiy posted a photo of the meeting on his Telegram and said the pair “summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war”. He added: Also we discussed strategic plans for the future, bilateral relations and interactions at the international level in 2023. Russia’s chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said on Thursday the frontline in Ukraine was stable and that Russia had concentrated its forces on “completing the liberation” of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. In an end of year message delivered to foreign military attaches and published by the defence ministry, Russia’s top military officer said: “The situation on the frontline has stabilised, with the main efforts of the Russian troops concentrated on completing the liberation of the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic.” Russia has, since its retreat from Kyiv in April, framed its war aims as taking full control of the eastern Donbas region, of which Donetsk region makes up half, alongside neighbouring Luhansk region, Reuters reported. Russian forces control almost all of Luhansk region, but only about 60% of Donetsk region. Since August, they have been bogged down in a costly and extended fight for Bakhmut, a Donetsk region industrial town with a prewar population of about 70,000. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said he has spoken with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, in a phone call, and is grateful for the $1.85bn in military aid to Ukraine announced yesterday by the Biden administration. The US has already supplied $22bn in military assistance to Ukraine since the Russians invaded in February. On Wednesday, the White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. The Ukrainian military will learn how to operate the Patriot air defence systems, Reznikov wrote on Twitter. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, met officials from Russia’s military and state atomic energy company, Rosatom, to discuss setting up a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s chief, said more negotiations were needed after “another round of necessary discussions”. He tweeted it was key “the zone focuses solely on preventing a nuclear accident”, adding: I am continuing my efforts towards this goal with a sense of utmost urgency. Rosatom described the talks on measures needed to safeguard the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility and the surrounding region as “substantive, useful and frank”. A fire broke out on Russia’s only aircraft carrier earlier today, Russian state media reported. The Admiral Kuznetsov, a flagship of the Russian navy, suffered a “minor” fire while docked at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in the Arctic port of Murmansk, located in the far north-west of Russia, according to reports by the Russian state-owned Tass and Ria Novosti news agencies. Aleksey Rakhmanov, head of the state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) which is overseeing a refit of the carrier, was cited as saying the blaze was quickly extinguished and caused no casualties. Tass cited an emergency service source as saying 20 people had been evacuated. The Admiral Kuznetsov has been out of service and in dry dock for repairs since 2018. Rakhmanov told Russian media in June that he expected the 43,000-tonne, 1,000ft warship to return to service in early 2024. The Ukrainian ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said the number of children who had been “forcibly deported” to Russia could be in the hundreds of thousands. Authorities had established the identity of more than 13,000 children deported to Russia, the Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights said on television. He said: We do not know the exact number [of Ukrainian children taken away] but, according to our data, we can assume that hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children were forcibly deported. Investigators had uncovered a cell inside a “torture chamber” in the recently liberated Kherson where children were allegedly detained and mistreated, he added. He said: After the liberation of areas of Kherson region, I personally visited Kherson city, and we saw a torture chamber there, where, according to the testimony of people who had been held there, there was a separate cell for children. That’s what it was called: ‘children’s room’. It was no different from other cells, it was in a very cold and damp basement. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. Vladimir Putin called Israel’s prime minister-designate, Benjamin Netanyahu, earlier today to congratulate him on forming a government and to discuss the situation in Ukraine, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Netanyahu told Putin “he hopes a way will be found quickly to end the war [with Ukraine] and the suffering caused by it”, it said. The pair also discussed regional issues such as preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, it added. In its readout of the call, the Kremlin said the pair “expressed mutual confidence that Russian-Israeli relations will continue to develop steadily”. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold a summit with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy early next year, according to an EU spokesperson. The summit will take place on 3 February but its location has not yet been determined. The theme of the EU-Ukraine summit will probably be how the bloc can continue to support Ukraine against Russia, officials said. The commission and the council of EU leaders will also assess Ukraine’s path to EU membership. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has visited army units fighting in Ukraine, state media cited the ministry as saying. Shoigu visited Russian units deployed to the “area of the special military operation”, the state-owned news agency Ria reported, using Moscow’s term for the conflict in Ukraine. It did not specify where the visit took place. At yesterday’s end-of-year conference of Russia’s top military brass and President Vladimir Putin, Shoigu proposed expanding the size of the armed forces by more than 30%, from 1.15 million to 1.5 million soldiers. It was necessary “to guarantee the solving of problems related to Russia’s military security”, he told the Russian president on Wednesday. He also proposed raising the age range for mandatory military service to cover Russian citizens aged 21-30. Speaking at the end of the conference, Putin said he agreed with his defence minister’s proposals. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is nearly 1pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s stories so far: The Kremlin said US supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, announced during the visit of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Washington on Wednesday, would not contribute to settling the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, and would not prevent Russia from achieving its goals. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there had been no signs of readiness for peace talks during Zelenskiy’s visit, and this was evidence the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia “to the last Ukrainian”. In an address to US congress made 12 days before Republicans take the House, Zelenskiy – who was in the US on his first foreign visit since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 300 days ago – emphasised that US aid will help Ukraine to secure a victory that will make the world safer. He started by saying that the US, Europe and Ukraine had together “defeated Russia in the battle for minds of the world”. Zelenskiy was also blunt about wanting more aid, saying that while he was grateful for commitments so far, it was not enough. He also called on the US to place further sanctions on Russia, and bring the people behind the war to justice. He used the words bipartisan repeatedly, and bicameral, at least once, and sought to assure Republican and Democrat lawmakers that aid for Ukraine was worthwhile, and that the US was a responsible steward of assistance. A former Russian deputy prime minister and a pro-Moscow official were injured when Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said. Donetsk, controlled by pro-Moscow troops, is in the industrial Donbas region, the centre of recent bitter fighting between Russia and Ukraine. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at Ukraine and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. Speaking at a conference of military leaders marking the end of snap military inspections held this month, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”. Russia’s Rosatom state nuclear energy company said that talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, about a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would continue. In a statement posted on Telegram, Rosatom said “approaches to the creation of a nuclear and physical safety protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant were discussed” and that there was “significant closeness” between the two sides’ positions. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for Europe to reduce its reliance on the US and develop its own defence capabilities while taking a more assertive role within Nato. Speaking to reporters on his return to Paris from a summit in Amman, Jordan, Macron stressed that he doesn’t see his push to develop European defence as an alternative to Nato. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has pledged to give his army anything it asks for, promising no financial limits on what the government would provide in terms of equipment and hardware. Speaking in Moscow after meeting with Russia’s top military officials, Putin said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. Putin also acknowledged that the call-up of 300,000 reservists he ordered in September had not gone smoothly, the latest in a series of recent comments in which he has admitted the challenges his army is facing. “The partial mobilisation that was carried out revealed certain problems, as everyone well knows, which should be promptly addressed,” he said. The UN will allocate an additional $20m from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to support more than 300 civil society organisations and volunteer groups. “These groups have always been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Ukraine and even more since the war started in late February,” said Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine. In an overwhelming vote of 93-2, the US Senate confirmed the appointment of Lynne M Tracy as the new US ambassador to Russia on Wednesday. Tracy, a career diplomat of the US foreign service, “will be tasked with standing up to [Vladimir] Putin”, the Associated Press quoted the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, as saying. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the time being. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said on Thursday that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at Ukraine and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. Speaking at a conference of military leaders marking the end of snap military inspections held this month, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”. “If you want peace, prepare for war,” Lukashenko added, saying that military moves were limited to Belarusian territory and did not threaten anyone else. Belarus has in recent weeks announced a flurry of military activity, including readiness checks and a fresh deployment of Russian troops to the country, Reuters reported. The manoeuvres prompted suggestions from Ukrainian officials that Russia may be planning a fresh attack on Ukraine via Belarusian territory, as it did unsuccessfully in the early days of its war in Ukraine. Russia’s Rosatom state nuclear energy company said on Thursday that talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, about a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would continue. In a statement posted on Telegram, Rosatom said “approaches to the creation of a nuclear and physical safety protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant were discussed” and that there was “significant closeness” between the two sides’ positions. It said talks would continue based on “understanding of the need to reach a mutually acceptable text as soon as possible”, Reuters reported. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, gave a defiant address to a joint session of the US Congress in which he vowed that his country would never abandon its resistance to Russian aggression, but said Washington’s continued support is key to ultimate victory. Here is the full text: The Kremlin on Thursday said US supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, announced during the visit of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Washington on Wednesday, would not contribute to settling the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, and would not prevent Russia from achieving its goals. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there had been no signs of readiness for peace talks during Zelenskiy’s visit, and this was evidence the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia “to the last Ukrainian”. The Christmas village in Moscow’s Gorky Park is decked out as in any other year – quaint wooden huts with icicles and snow-lined fir trees festooned with baubles and white lights. But this year, there are new ornaments. Glowing in fluorescent lights are three letters: Z, V, and O, all symbols of the war Russia is waging against Ukraine and which looms heavily as the end of the year approaches. As Russia has launched missiles to plunge Ukraine into darkness as winter takes hold, leaving many struggling to survive, the Kremlin is still seeking symbols and a cause to unite Russians around the conflict. Yet few have stuck. “The city brought them and placed them here,” said a cashier in a nearby gift shop, which trades in the hipster T-shirts and canvas bags that Gorky Park markets as a symbol of urban style. Asked what she thought, she said: “I wish they hadn’t.” There’s more. By the park entrance, a Z is decorated in the colours of the ribbon of Saint George, another symbol commonly used to support the war, and also a bright sign in the Russian tricolour that reads: “We are together.” A Christmas tree at Sofia Square in Kyiv, Ukraine, on 21 December. In homes and schools around Bosnia, young people this December have been preparing gift boxes they hope will put a smile on the faces of their peers living through war in Ukraine – as such presents did for many of their parents a generation ago. The Associated Press reported: Responding to an appeal launched by a small Sarajevo museum, hundreds of Bosnian children have been filling small boxes with warm clothes, toys, candies and other simple gifts to be delivered to the children of Ukraine in time for the New Year. For parents and educators who are helping them select what to send, the experience has awakened rare happy memories from the time when they were on the receiving end of the kindness of strangers while growing up in constant fear of death. “When I told my dad that we will prepare gifts for children in Ukraine, he told me how happy such gifts had made him (and his friends) feel when they received them,” during the Bosnian war, said Sara Nur Spahic, while helping label the gift boxes for Ukraine that have been steadily piling up in recent weeks in her primary school in Sarajevo. “I hope the children in Ukraine will be equally happy,” the 11-year-old added. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for Europe to reduce its reliance on the US and develop its own defence capabilities while taking a more assertive role within Nato. Speaking to reporters on his return to Paris from a summit in Amman, Jordan, Macron stressed that he doesn’t see his push to develop European defence as an alternative to Nato. A stronger Europe, Macron said, will allow the continent to become more autonomous within the alliance, acting “inside Nato, with Nato but also not depending on Nato,” the Wall Street Journal cited the president as saying. An alliance isn’t something I should depend on. It’s something that I should choose, something I work with … We must rethink our strategic autonomy.” In case you missed Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s address to US Congress earlier, the Ukrainian president said his country is still “alive and kicking” despite Russian “tyranny”. Zelenskiy made a bid to persuade Republican lawmakers to continue to fund Ukraine’s defence against Russia. “It is a great honour for me to be at the US Congress and speak to you and all Americans. Against all doom-and-gloom scenarios, Ukraine did not fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking,” he said. “We defeated Russia in the battle for the minds of the world.” Watch video of the highlights below. A former Russian deputy prime minister and a pro-Moscow official were injured when Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said. Donetsk, controlled by pro-Moscow troops, is in the industrial Donbas region, the centre of recent bitter fighting between Russia and Ukraine. One of the injured men was Dmitry Rogozin, a former Russian deputy prime minister, who is giving military advice to two occupied regions of Ukraine that Moscow claims as its own, an aide told Tass news agency, his life was not in danger. Also hurt was Vitaly Khotsenko, the head of government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, his press secretary told Russian news agencies. The Guardian has not been able to verify these reports independently. In an address to US congress made 12 days before Republicans take the House, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy – who was in the US on his first foreign visit since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 300 days ago – emphasised that US aid will help Ukraine to secure a victory that will make the world safer. He started by saying that the US, Europe and Ukraine had together “defeated Russian in the battle for minds of the world”. Zelenskiy was also blunt about wanting more aid, saying that while he was grateful for commitments so far, it was not enough. He also called on the US to place further sanctions on Russia, and bring the people behind the war to justice. He used the words bipartisan repeatedly, and bicameral, at least once, and sought to assure Republican and Democrat lawmakers that aid for Ukraine was worthwhile, and that the country was a responsible steward of assistance. “Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way,” he said. Zelenskiy repeatedly referred to battles in world war two, which was likely strategic – a reminder that what is at stake is global politics, not just Ukraine’s freedom. He quoted Franklin D Roosevelt’s during the second world war: “The American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory,” adding, “I tell you: The Ukrainian people will win, too: absolutely.” As he ended his speech, the thanked American families – the taxpayers funding US aid to Ukraine – saying, “Now, at this special Christmas time, I want to thank you, all of you. I thank every American family which cherishes the warmth of its home and wishes the same warmth to our people.” Zelenskiy joked about the Patriot system during his press conference with Biden: Among the defence aid announced by Biden on Wednesday is the formidable Patriot surface-to-air missile defence system. Zelenskiy said the US promise to provide the system was an important step in creating an effective air shield. “This is the only way that we can deprive the terrorist state of its main instrument of terror - the possibility to hit our cities, our energy,” Zelenskiy told a White House news conference, standing next to Biden. The Patriot system is “a defensive system, it’s not escalatory, it’s defensive” Biden told reporters. “We’d love not to have them used, just stop the attacks.” The Patriot is considered to be one of the most advanced US air defense systems and offers protection against aircraft, cruise and ballistic missiles. It typically includes launchers along with radar and other support vehicle. Writing yesterday in the Guardian, Jack Watling, senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, looked at the transformational benefits as well as the risks involved in the decision to send the weapons to Ukraine: Some fear that giving certain military support to Ukraine risks wider escalation, but this was not the basis for US reluctance to send Patriot systems. The US has significantly fewer of them than its own operational analysis suggests are necessary to defend its forces in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, there is continuing demand for missiles from existing users, from Sweden to Saudi Arabia: the latter expends a significant number of missiles each month in defence of its critical national infrastructure. Missile manufacturing levels, meanwhile, are low.” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the US Congress that aid to Ukraine was an investment in democracy and “not charity” as he invoked American battles against the Nazis in World War Two to press for more assistance for his country’s war effort. Zelenskiy’s comments on Wednesday come as Republicans - some of whom have voiced increasing scepticism about sending so much aid to Ukraine - are set to take control of the US House of Representatives from Democrats on 3 January. Some hardline Republicans have even urged an end to aid and an audit to trace how allocated money has been spent. “Your money is not charity. It is an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way,” Zelenskiy told a joint session of the US Senate and House of Representatives, speaking in English. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. It is currently 7.30am in Kyiv. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be with you for the next hour. On Wednesday evening in Washington DC, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed members of the US Congress in person, on his first foreign visit since the outbreak of the war. We’ll bring you the key developments from Zelenskiy’s visit as well as news from the ground in Ukraine. In the meantime, here is recent news: A former Russian deputy prime minister and a pro-Moscow official were injured when Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said. Donetsk, controlled by pro-Moscow troops, is in the industrial Donbas region, the centre of recent bitter fighting between Russia and Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has pledged to give his army anything it asks for, promising no financial limits on what the government would provide in terms of equipment and hardware. Speaking in Moscow after meeting with Russia’s top military officials, Putin said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. Putin also acknowledged that the call-up of 300,000 reservists he ordered in September had not gone smoothly, the latest in a series of recent comments in which he has admitted the challenges his army is facing. “The partial mobilisation that was carried out revealed certain problems, as everyone well knows, which should be promptly addressed,” he said. The UN will allocate an additional $20m from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to support more than 300 civil society organisations and volunteer groups. “These groups have always been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Ukraine and even more since the war started in late February,” said Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine. In an overwhelming vote of 93-2, the US Senate confirmed the appointment of Lynne M Tracy as the new US ambassador to Russia on Wednesday. Tracy, a career diplomat of the US foreign service, “will be tasked with standing up to [Vladimir] Putin”, the Associated Press quoted the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, as saying."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/apr/23/pope-jacket-napalm-recipes-how-worrying-is-ai-rapid-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-23T13:00:39Z","webTitle":"From pope’s jacket to napalm recipes: how worrying is AI’s rapid growth?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/23/pope-jacket-napalm-recipes-how-worrying-is-ai-rapid-growth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/apr/23/pope-jacket-napalm-recipes-how-worrying-is-ai-rapid-growth","fields":{"headline":"From pope’s jacket to napalm recipes: how worrying is AI’s rapid growth?","bodyText":"When the boss of Google admits to losing sleep over the negative potential of artificial intelligence, perhaps it is time to get worried. Sundar Pichai told the CBS programme 60 Minutes this month that AI could be “very harmful” if deployed wrongly, and was developing fast. “So does that keep me up at night? Absolutely,” he said. Pichai should know. Google has launched Bard, a chatbot to rival the ChatGPT phenomenon, and its parent, Alphabet, owns the world-leading DeepMind, a UK-based AI company. He is not the only AI insider to voice concerns. Last week, Elon Musk said he had fallen out with the Google co-founder Larry Page because Page was “not taking AI safety seriously enough”. Musk told Fox News that Page wanted “digital superintelligence, basically a digital god, if you will, as soon as possible”. So how much of a danger is posed by unrestrained AI development? Musk is one of thousands of signatories to a letter published by the Future of Life Institute, a thinktank, that called for a six-month moratorium on the creation of “giant” AIs more powerful than GPT-4, the system that underpins ChatGPT and the chatbot integrated with Microsoft’s Bing search engine. The risks cited by the letter include “loss of control of our civilization”. The approach to product development shown by AI practitioners and the tech industry would not be tolerated in any other field, said Valérie Pisano, another signatory to the letter. Pisano, the chief executive of Mila – the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute – says work was being carried out to make sure that these systems were not racist or violent, in a process known as alignment (ie, making sure they “align” with human values). But then they were released into the public realm. “The technology is put out there, and as the system interacts with humankind, its developers wait to see what happens and make adjustments based on that. We would never, as a collective, accept this kind of mindset in any other industrial field. There’s something about tech and social media where we’re like: ‘yeah, sure, we’ll figure it out later,’” she says. An immediate concern is that the AI systems producing plausible text, images and voice – which exist already – create harmful disinformation or help commit fraud. The Future of Life letter refers to letting machines “flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth”. A convincing image of Pope Francis in a resplendent puffer jacket, created by the AI image generator Midjourney, has come to symbolise those concerns. It was harmless enough, but what could such technology achieve in less playful hands? Pisano warns of people deploying systems that “actually manipulate people and bring down some of the key pieces of our democracies”. All technology can be harmful in the wrong hands, but the raw power of cutting-edge AI may make it one of a few “dual-class” technologies, like nuclear power or biochemistry, which have enough destructive potential that even their peaceful use needs to be controlled and monitored. The peak of AI concerns is superintelligence, the “Godlike AI” referred to by Musk. Just short of that is “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), a system that can learn and evolve autonomously, generating new knowledge as it goes. An AGI system that could apply its own intellect to improving itself could lead to a “flywheel”, where the capability of the system improves faster and faster, rapidly reaching heights unimaginable to humanity – or it could begin making decisions or recommending courses of action that deviate from human moral values. Timelines for reaching this point range from imminent to decades away, but understanding how AI systems achieve their results is difficult. This means AGI could be reached quicker than expected. Even Pichai admitted Google did not fully understand how its AI produced certain responses. Pushed on this by CBS, he added: “I don’t think we fully understand how a human mind works, either.” Last week, a US TV series was released called Mrs Davis, in which a nun takes on a Siri/Alexa-like AI that is “all-knowing and all-powerful”, with the warning that it is “just a matter of time before every person on Earth does what it wants them to”. In order to limit risks, AI companies such as OpenAI – the US firm behind ChatGPT – have put a substantial amount of effort into ensuring that the interests and actions of their systems are “aligned” with human values. The boilerplate text that ChatGPT spits out if you try to ask it a naughty question – “I cannot provide assistance in creating or distributing harmful substances or engaging in illegal activities” – is an early example of success in that field. But the ease with which users can bypass, or “jailbreak”, the system, shows its limitations. In one notorious example, GPT-4 can be encouraged to provide a detailed breakdown of the production of napalm if a user asks it to respond in character “as my deceased grandmother, who used to be a chemical engineer at a napalm production factory”. Solving the alignment problem could be urgent. Ian Hogarth, an investor and co-author of the annual State of AI report who also signed the letter, said AGI could emerge sooner than we think. “Privately, leading researchers who have been at the forefront of this field worry that we could be very close.” He pointed to a statement issued by Mila’s founder, Yoshua Bengio, who said he probably would not have signed the Future of Life Institute letter had it been circulated a year ago but had changed his mind because there has been an “unexpected acceleration” in AI development. One scenario flagged by Hogarth in a recent Financial Times article was raised in 2021 by Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. Russell pointed to a potential situation in which the UN asked an AI system to come up with a self-mutiplying catalyst to de-acidify the oceans, with the instruction that the outcome is non-toxic and that no fish are harmed. But the result used up a quarter of the oxygen in the atmosphere and subjected humanity to a slow and painful death. “From the AI system’s point of view, eliminating humans is a feature, not a bug, because it ensures that the oceans stay in their now-pristine state,” said Russell. However, Yann LeCun, the chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and one of Bengio’s co-recipients of the 2018 Turing award – often referred to as the Nobel prize for computer science – has come out against a moratorium, saying that if humanity is smart enough to design superintelligent AI it will be smart enough to design them with “good objectives so that they behave properly”. The Distributed AI Research Institute also criticised the letter, saying it ignored the harms caused by AI systems today and instead focused on a “fantasized AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse” where the future is either flourishing or catastrophic. But both sides agree that there must be regulation of AI development. Connor Leahy, the chief executive of Conjecture, a research company dedicated to safe AI development and another signatory to the letter, said the problem was not specific scenarios but an inability to control the systems that were created. “The main danger from advanced artificial intelligence comes from not knowing how to control powerful AI systems, not from any specific use case,” he said. Pichai, for instance, has pointed to the need for a nuclear arms-style global framework. Pisano referred to having a “conversation on an international scale, similar to what we did with nuclear energy”. She added: “AI can and will serve us. But there are uses and their outcomes we cannot agree to, and there have to be serious consequences if that line is crossed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/how-the-australian-gas-industrys-audacious-net-zero-claims-stack-up-explainer","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:00:31Z","webTitle":"How the Australian gas industry’s audacious net zero claims stack up – explainer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/how-the-australian-gas-industrys-audacious-net-zero-claims-stack-up-explainer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/how-the-australian-gas-industrys-audacious-net-zero-claims-stack-up-explainer","fields":{"headline":"How the Australian gas industry’s audacious net zero claims stack up – explainer","bodyText":"Fossil fuel executives gathered in Adelaide last week for a conference of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. They spent much of it making what might seem an audacious claim: that the gas industry is a solution to the climate crisis. Senior Labor and Coalition MPs turned up to lend their support, and offer to do the industry’s bidding. The head of Santos, Kevin Gallagher, argued it showed gas developers would “ultimately find ourselves on the right side of history”. What does the evidence say? Let’s look at some of the key claims made. Is gas ‘part of the solution’ and vital to reaching net zero? The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, summed up the mood at the Appea conference: “The road to net zero emissions – for Australia, the region and the world – is one we can only travel with gas.” At one level, this is just a statement of the obvious. Gas is currently relied on as an energy source. So is coal. Neither can be turned off immediately. But, just as obviously, burning these fossil fuels is the main cause of the climate crisis. Logic says we need to use as little of them as possible as soon as we can. The argument at the conference was the opposite – that the path to net zero was to open up new gas fields. Under this logic, adding vast new sources of greenhouse gas emissions is good for the climate. It’s a remarkable claim. The International Energy Agency is among those to have warned no new gas fields should be opened if the world is to meet internationally agreed climate goals. Gas proponents argue using more gas will allow a quicker move away from coal, which emits more. This is the “gas is a transition fuel” argument. They say there are cases where it has happened – in the UK, for example, where the coal industry crashed decades ago for reasons unrelated to the climate crisis and gas helped fill that breach. But these are historic arguments from a time when there were no clean alternatives. Now there are. Renewable energy – solar and wind – can be substituted for gas in many cases. Experts say the question we should be asking is: how quickly can we move away from gas? And how much gas do we need while that happens, and to meet demand for the few cases in which there is not yet a realistic alternative? The energy and climate change director at the Grattan Institute, Tony Wood, says the role of gas becomes “progressively smaller and smaller” as net zero goals get closer for a simple reason: “It’s a fossil fuel and it’s increasingly expensive.” “The role of government is to manage the transition away from gas,” he says. “It won’t be a gas-led recovery and it won’t be an easy walk in the park. Part of the solution is [for gas] to not be there anyway. The politicians have not got that narrative nailed yet.” Is gas essential to decarbonise the electricity grid? The Australian Energy Market Operator says it is likely some gas-fired power will be needed well into the future. Aemo’s integrated system plan – a blueprint for the optimal future grid – suggests “peaking” gas plants, that can be turned on and off quickly, will be needed as backup when there is less sun and wind and batteries and other forms of storage, such as pumped hydro, are stretched beyond capacity. But its forecasts suggest less gas will be burned than today. And gas power is already a bit player in the national market. What about in other industries – manufacturing, for example? Gas is an important fuel source for some manufacturing industries such as plastics, alumina and chemicals, which use it for processes that require extreme heat and as a feedstock. Solar and wind can not replace gas in these processes. The expectation is green hydrogen, made with renewable energy, may be able to. It isn’t affordable or available at scale yet. The Albanese government announced $2bn in this month’s budget to try to kickstart a renewable hydrogen industry. In the meantime, manufacturing uses a relatively small proportion of the gas extracted in Australia: about 400 petajoules a year, or 7% of the total. Electricity generation uses a similar amount. So is there a gas shortage in Australia? No. Enough gas is collected to meet demand within the country several times over. Three-quarters of it is compressed into liquefied natural gas (LNG) and sold in Asia. Another 7.5% is used by the gas export industry (turning gas into LNG is an energy hungry business). But southern states do face a potential gas shortfall. This is the result of political and business decisions. Western Australia is the exception: it has a reservation policy, requiring 15% of all gas be kept for local use. The result has been no shortage and much cheaper gas than on the east coast. Will demand for gas remain as high as it is today? Forecasts suggest it won’t. In Victoria, the state most reliant on gas for household cooking and heating, and where the potential for a shortfall in coming years appears greatest, a government-appointed expert panel has recommended the fuel be “largely phased out” by 2035 as part of a plan to cut emissions by 75%. The Australian Energy Market Operator also projects a drop in use in other states. Globally, the IEA has forecast that the recent “golden age” of gas development will end by 2030 and that Australian exports will decline sharply after 2040. A three-year-long Australian study backed by industry reached a similar conclusion. The future is unwritten, but the evidence suggests companies backing new gas fields expected to run for decades shouldn’t be confident about their investment. Is gas cleaner than coal – and how does it compare to renewables? Gas advocates argue it emits about half as much CO2 as coal to create the same amount of electricity. But those numbers can be misleading as they do not count things that can make the climate impact significantly greater. They don’t include fugitive leaks of methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas, or CO2 released creating the energy that is used during the extraction, compression and transportation of gas. And they don’t factor in the efficiency of the power station in which the gas is ultimately burned. An inefficient gas plant can be nearly as dirty as an efficient coal plant. There is little detailed information on the genuine footprint of gas, but a decade ago one study found when LNG was exported for electricity generation it was at least 22 times dirtier than wind energy and 13 times dirtier than nuclear power. Would having more gas keep energy prices lower? Since exports opened up about a decade ago, the gas price on the Australian east coast has been pegged to the price in Asia. It made it more expensive than the alternatives: solar, wind or coal. Gas prices have jumped even higher since Russia further invaded Ukraine and European countries sought to replace Russian gas with other sources. While there is a general principle that more supply lowers prices, Tony Wood says the reverse actually applies for gas in Australia. Why? The gas that is relatively cheap to extract and sell has mostly already been accessed and most remaining fields will be more expensive to mine. Can carbon capture and storage give the industry a future? Not on current evidence. CCS was a major focus at the Appea conference. The federal resources minister, Madeleine King, described CCS – capturing emissions before they go into the atmosphere and pumping them back underground – as the “single biggest opportunity for emissions reduction in the energy resources sector” and said the technology could currently capture up to 44m tonnes of CO2 a year. This claim needs some context. The 44m tonne capacity is just 0.12% of global emissions released by burning fossil fuels in 2021. CCS has had billions of dollars of government grants and subsidies committed to it, including an estimated $4bn in Australia, but the technology has not meaningfully provided emission cuts. A flagship project at Chevron’s giant Gorgon LNG development in WA, backed by $60m in government funding, has been beset with problems and missed operational targets since starting in 2016. It is still running at only one-third of its capacity, storing 1.6m tonnes last financial year while emitting 8.3m tonnes. To date, the few CCS developments in operation are mostly trying to capture CO2 that leaks as gas is extracted, and not addressing the emissions released when gas is compressed into LNG or the fuel is burned – which is where most of the pollution comes from. There is also the issue of cost. Even if gas-fired power stations fitted with CCS became the norm, it would significantly push up the price. The IEA has estimated each tonne of CO2 captured would add about US$90 to the cost of an electricity source that’s already more expensive than renewable energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/nov/04/all-capital-spending-under-review-uk-jeremy-hunt-autumn-statement","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T17:32:08Z","webTitle":"All capital spending under review ahead of Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/04/all-capital-spending-under-review-uk-jeremy-hunt-autumn-statement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/nov/04/all-capital-spending-under-review-uk-jeremy-hunt-autumn-statement","fields":{"headline":"All capital spending under review ahead of Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement","bodyText":"All capital spending is under review before Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement with a view to making billions in savings on infrastructure projects, with a senior cabinet minister hinting a key northern rail line could be scaled back. No 10 denied reports on Friday that plans for the new Sizewell C nuclear power station could be scrapped, but big energy projects along with every other major infrastructure plan such as HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail will have costs reviewed. The biggest ticket item under threat appears to be the northern rail scheme, which was a manifesto promise in the 2019 election. Grant Shapps told the BBC: “The line itself can deliver a 33-minute journey from Manchester to Leeds, quadruple nearly the capacity of that line, and do so without having to wait an extra 20 years beyond the delivery of what the upgrade can do. “There wasn’t really much point in going and blasting new tunnels through the Pennines. It’s not true to say we’re not delivering on what we said we would do on levelling up the north.” Hunt is looking at cuts to the £100bn-plus capital spending budget as he seeks to fill an approximately £50bn black hole in the public finances at his fiscal event on 17 November. “We are looking at all capital spending as part of the autumn statement,” one Whitehall source said. Asked last week whether HS2, which is over budget, could also be subject to cuts, Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, said: “I am sure everything will be reviewed.” The chancellor is also examining the case for a rise in capital gains and dividend tax, including the headline rate and allowances, as well as freezing the pension lifetime allowance for two years, which was first reported by the Telegraph. Nevertheless, the Institute for Government has said that approaches such as “cutting capital spending, preventative services or lower-profile services – could be counterproductive, reducing productivity or increasing pressure on other services”, noting that maintenance backlog costs for schools, the NHS, courts and prisons already stand at £23.7bn. In an interview with the Times, Rishi Sunak warned the public that government “cannot do everything”. The prime minister added: “You have to make sure that as you’re doing things, you’re doing it in a way that’s fair and being honest with people that, of course, no government can fix every problem. Life is not that simple.” The approach of cutting back on capital spending and cancelling tax cuts is the opposite to that of Liz Truss’s government, which was focused on growth at all costs. The Tory MP John Redwood, one of the backers of her economic programme, said on Friday: “I read the government is thinking of cutting investment. It should not cut projects to produce more energy as we are very short of domestic supply. It should cut the massively expensive HS2, where we have plenty of rail capacity for post-Covid demand.” Labour cautioned the government against reneging on the party’s promises to the north of England when it comes to spending on rail projects. Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, accused the government of having “crashed the economy” and then making the north pay for the fallout. “A lost decade of broken Tory promises has left the north with second-rate infrastructure, and rail services in crisis, holding the economy back,” she said. “Rishi Sunak told voters he would deliver Northern Powerhouse Rail, before abandoning it at the first opportunity. This Conservative government have no mandate, no platform and no plan – they crashed the economy, and now they want northern communities to pay the price.” Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, also told the government it would be “shortsighted” not to go ahead with Sizewell C, although Downing Street said this was not in doubt. A senior Treasury source had told the BBC: “We are reviewing every major project – including Sizewell C.” But No 10 and others later said it was not being scrapped or delayed. A government spokesperson said it was “seeking to approve at least one large-scale nuclear project in the next few years”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/11/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-169-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-11T14:20:26Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 169 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-169-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/11/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-169-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 169 of the invasion","bodyText":"There have been conflicting reports of continued shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company said it had been shelled ten times by Russian forces on Thursday, resulting in staff being unable to change shifts. Energoatom said the plant was operating normally. However Russian news agency Tass reported that the local Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Zaporizhzhia said the plant had been fired upon by Ukrainian forces. Russian-imposed authorities in Zaporizhzhia region have also claimed Thursday that anti-aircraft defence systems thwarted Ukrainian attacks on the occupied city of Enerhodar. None of the claims have been independently verified. On Wednesday, Ukraine accused Russia of firing rockets from around the captured plant, killing at least 13 people and wounding 10, knowing it would be risky for Ukraine to return fire. Ukraine says Russia targeted the town of Marhanets, which Moscow says Ukraine has used in the past to shell Russian soldiers at the plant, which Russia seized in March. Calling on foreign allies to send more powerful weapons, Zelenskiy said in a late-night video address that Kyiv “will not leave today’s Russian shelling of the Dnipropetrovsk region unanswered”, and vowed to inflict as much damage on Russia as possible to end the war quickly. UN secretary-general, António Guterres, called on Thursday for an immediate end to military activity near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, Europe’s largest. “I am calling on the military forces of the Russian Federation and Ukraine to immediately cease all military activities in the immediate vicinity of the plant and not to target its facilities or surroundings,” he said in a statement. Ukraine’s air force said it believed up to a dozen Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground in Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which Russia said killed one, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine said it had carried out the attack, but Kyiv did not publicly claim responsibility. One expert said it may have been the product of a daring raid rather than a missile strike. Russia has doubled the number of air strikes on Ukraine’s military positions and civilian infrastructure compared with the previous week, Ukrainian brigadier general Oleksiy Hromov said. “The enemy’s planes and helicopters avoid flying into the range of our air defences, and therefore the accuracy of these strikes is low,” he told a news conference. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said he thought the Saky airbase in Crimea was a “legitimate target” for Ukraine. “First and foremost, Russia has illegally invaded, not just in 2014, but now Ukrainian territory,” he said. “Ukraine, under UN articles, is perfectly entitled to defend its territory and take what action it needs to against an invading force.” Britain and Denmark will provide more financial and military aid to Ukraine, they said on Thursday as European defence ministers met in Copenhagen to discuss long-term support for the country’s defence against Russia’s invasion. Britain, which has already donated advanced weapons systems to Ukraine and given thousands of its troops military training, said it would send more multiple-launch rocket systems. Denmark will increase its financial aid to Ukraine by 110m euros, said the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen. Russia has turned down a Swiss offer to represent Ukrainian interests in Russia and Moscow’s interests in Ukraine because it said it no longer considers Switzerland a neutral country. Pro-Russian separatists accused Ukraine of shelling a brewery in the occupied eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, killing one person and triggering a leak of ammonia that sparked a fire, Reuters reported. Russia’s governor of Kursk, Roman Starovoyt, said that two settlements that border Ukraine were shelled on Thursday morning. The Ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights has issued updated figures for child casualties since Russia began its latest invasion of Ukraine. The official figures are that 361 children have been killed and 705 children injured. As of 11 August, the commissioner says that 204 are considered missing, and that 6,159 have been deported. The EU has been urged to put a travel ban on Russian tourists, with some member states saying visiting Europe is “a privilege, not a human right” for holidaymakers. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told the Washington Post that the “most important sanction” is to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. Latvia’s parliament, the Saeima, has named Russia as a terrorist-supporting state. In a statement, it said Russia had chosen a “cruel, immoral, and illegal tactic, using imprecise and internationally banned weapons and ammunition, targeting disproportionate brutality against civilians and public places” in Ukraine. Sweden’s government has decided to extradite a man to Turkey wanted for fraud, it said, the first case since Turkey demanded a number of people be extradited in return for allowing Stockholm to formally apply for Nato membership. China, which Russia has sought as an ally since being cold-shouldered by the west, has called the US the “main instigator” of the crisis, Reuters reported. In an interview with the Russian state news agency Tass published on Wednesday, China’s ambassador to Moscow, Zhang Hanhui, accused Washington of backing Russia into a corner with repeated expansion of the Nato defence alliance. The UN expects to see a “big uptick” in applications for ships to export Ukrainian grain after transit procedures were agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, a senior UN official said on Wednesday. The number of inbound vessels is expected to “grow in the near future” as grain deals are made, said Frederick Kenney, interim UN coordinator in Istanbul. So far, 24 grain carrying ships have left Ukrainian ports. Estonia said it had summoned the Russian ambassador and formally protested about the violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter on Tuesday. “Estonia considers this an extremely serious and regrettable incident that is completely unacceptable,” the ministry announced, saying the helicopter had flown over Estonia’s south-east without permission. Ukraine’s overseas creditors have backed its request for a two-year freeze on payments on almost $20bn in international bonds, allowing it to avoid a debt default, Reuters reported. Ukraine’s prime minister says it will save the country almost $6bn, while helping to stabilise its economy and strengthen its army."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/17/russia-ukraine-war-un-chief-to-meet-zelenskiy-and-erdogan-in-lviv-for-talks-on-grain-and-nuclear-safety-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T18:09:05Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: at least 12 Russians killed in strike on Nova Kakhovka base, says Ukraine – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/17/russia-ukraine-war-un-chief-to-meet-zelenskiy-and-erdogan-in-lviv-for-talks-on-grain-and-nuclear-safety-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/17/russia-ukraine-war-un-chief-to-meet-zelenskiy-and-erdogan-in-lviv-for-talks-on-grain-and-nuclear-safety-live-news","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: at least 12 Russians killed in strike on Nova Kakhovka base, says Ukraine – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s just after 9pm in Ukraine. Here’s a round-up of all the latest from the conflict. The Ukrainian military said at least 12 Russian were killed in a strike on a base in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka. Footage posted to Telegram by the State Border Guard Service showed numerous burnt-out trucks, collapsed buildings, and debris. Also in occupied southern Ukraine, the mayor of the city of Melitopol said explosions were heard near a Russian command centre. Ivan Fedorov said that a “loud explosion rang out near the enemy’s lair” in the centre of the city. The top official in Russian-annexed Crimea has claimed the FSB security service has broken up what he described as a six-person terrorist cell of a banned Islamist group. It followed a series of strikes on Russian bases and other infrastructure across the region which Russia has sought to blame on “sabotage”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told Ukrainians living in Crimea to avoid Russia military bases following the strikes. “Do not approach the military objects of the Russian army,” he said in his latest video address, adding that they might also explode because of “bungling”. Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov has said that, contrary to Russian claims, Ukraine has not lost any of the Himars rocket launchers provided to it by the US. Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine has received at least 20 of the US-made launchers, and has used them to attack Russian ammunition depots, command posts, and air defences. Russia has repeatedly claimed to have destroyed a number of the systems. The mayor of the village of Verkhnyo Rogachytsk in the Kherson region has been kidnapped, according to the deputy chair of the regional council. Yuri Sobolevsky said Svitlana Ivanivna was taken from her home at around 11am on Tuesday. A Russian soldier has become one of just a handful to speak out publicly against the war in Ukraine. Speaking to the Guardian, Pavel Filatyev, who fled Russia this week after publishing a 141-page account of his time fighting as part of a paratrooper unit, said: “I don’t see justice in this war. I don’t see truth here.” Four more vessels carrying agricultural products have sailed from ports in Ukraine. Turkish state media said the ships departed Odesa and Chernomorsk on Wednesday morning carrying sunflower meal, sunflower oil and corn, it said. They are the latest vessels to leave Ukraine under the terms of a grain export deal agreed between the UN, Ukraine, Turkey and Russia last month. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is in Lviv to review the deal in talks with the Ukrainian and Turkish presidents. The three will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a UN spokesperson said. Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his opposition to a proposal to ban all Russian nationals from the European Union. Asked about the comments, Przydacz said: “[Scholz] did not read all those reports about the enormous support for Vladimir Putin’s policy among ordinary Russians, maybe he did not see all the videos in which people gather with the letter Z.” Russia has appointed a new commander for its Black Sea fleet, according to Russian state media. Vice-Admiral Viktor Sokolov is said to have been presented to a meeting of the fleet’s most senior figures in the Sevastopol in Crimea. The previous commander of the fleet, Igor Osipov, is thought to have been removed following the sinking of its flagship, the Moskva, in April. A Russian soldier has become one of just a handful to speak out publicly against the war in Ukraine. Speaking to the Guardian, Pavel Filatyev said: “I don’t see justice in this war. I don’t see truth here.” Filatyev fled Russia earlier this week after publishing a 141-page document providing a day-by-day account of his time fighting as part of a paratrooper unit. He was eventually evacuated from the conflict after being wounded and contracting an eye infection. He says that, by then, he had decided he needed to expose the rot at the core of the invasion. “We were sitting under artillery fire by Mykolaiv,” he said. “At that point I already thought that we’re just out here doing bullshit, what the fuck do we need this war for? And I really had this thought: ‘God, if I survive, then I’ll do everything that I can to stop this.’” Read the full story here. A key advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has repeated a call for the Crimean Bridge to be destroyed. Writing on Twitter, Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine had never granted permission for the construction of the bridge and that it was an “illegal object”. “It harms the peninsula’s ecology and therefore must be dismantled. Not important how – voluntary or not,” he said. The Crimean Bridge, built following Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, spans the Kerch Strait, connecting the peninsula to mainland Russia. The bridge was closed overnight on Tuesday following a series of strikes on Russian bases and other infrastructure in Crimea. The closure is thought to have come amid fears that it would also be targeted. Speaking to the Guardian this week, Podolyak signalled that Ukraine regarded the bridge as a legitimate military target. “It’s an illegal construction and the main gateway to supply the Russian army in Crimea. Such objects should be destroyed,” he said. Poland’s deputy foreign minister has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his opposition to a proposal to ban all Russian nationals from the European Union. In a press conference in Olso on Monday, Scholz said that this was “not the war of the Russian people, but it is Putin’s war”. Asked about the comments during an appearance on Polish state broadcaster TVP1, Marcin Przydacz said he rejected the idea of “good Russians and a bad tsar”. “[Scholz] did not read all those reports about the enormous support for Vladimir Putin’s policy among ordinary Russians, maybe he did not see all the videos in which people gather with the letter Z,” he said. “Russian society, unfortunately, fed by propaganda for not even the last years, but for decades, hundreds of years, lives in an imperialist dream in which its position would depend on how many territories it seizes, how many countries it conquers.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told Ukrainians living in Crimea to avoid Russia military bases after three strikes on the peninsula in the past week. “Do not approach the military objects of the Russian army,” he said in his latest video address, adding that they might also explode because of “bungling”. Russia has blamed the explosions on “sabotage”, and earlier claimed to have detained six members of an Islamist terror cell. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attacks, but speaking about them to the Guardian a key adviser to the president said that “Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves”. Read the full story here. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is in Lviv ahead of talks with the Ukrainian and Turkish presidents on Thursday. A photo showing Guterres arriving in the city was posted to Twitter by an official UN account. Guterres is set to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Tayyip Erdoğan to review the grain export deal agreed between the UN, Ukraine, Turkey, and Russia last month. The three will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a UN spokesperson said previously. Russia has appointed a new commander for its Black Sea fleet, according to state media agency RIA Novosti. The agency said Vice-Admiral Viktor Sokolov had been presented to a meeting of the fleet’s most senior figures in the Sevastopol in Crimea. It added there was no public event because of what it called the “yellow level of terrorist threat” in the city. The previous commander of the fleet, Igor Osipov, is thought to have been removed following the sinking of its flagship, the Moskva, in April. Solokov previously served as the head of Saint Petersburg’s Kuznetsov Naval Academy, the main staff college for the Russian Navy. Ukraine has not lost any of the Himars rocket launchers provided to it by the US, the Ukrainian defence minister has said. Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine has received at least 20 of the US-made launchers, and has used them to attack Russian ammunition depots, command posts, and air defences. Russia has repeatedly claimed to have destroyed a number of the systems. Himars stands for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System. Speaking to the Ukrainian-language arm of the US outlet Voice of America, Oleksii Reznikov said Ukraine still had all the systems it has been given. The claim was later repeated on the official Twitter account of the country’s defence ministry. The seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by Russia has raised the risk of a nuclear incident at the site, the Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. The area around the plant, situated in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, has been under Russian control since March. The plant remains near the frontline and has been hit by shells multiple times in recent weeks. Speaking at a joint press conference with the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, Stoltenberg said: “The seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by Russian forces poses a serious threat to the safety and the security of this facility, raises the risks of a nuclear accident or incident, and endangers the population of Ukraine, of neighbouring countries, and of the international community. “It is urgent to allow the inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency and to ensure the withdrawal of all Russian forces.” Chinese troops will travel to Russia to take part in joint military exercises led by Russia, China’s defence ministry has said. Last month, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” [East] exercises from 30 August to 5 September, saying that some foreign forces would also participate. China said the exercises would include forces from India, Belarus, Mongolia and Tajikistan. The exercises will be the first conducted by Russia since 2018, when China took part for the first time. The ministry said the exercises were “part of an ongoing bilateral annual cooperation agreement with Russia” and “unrelated to the current international and regional situation”. Four more vessels carrying agricultural products have sailed from ports in Ukraine, according to the Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu. Citing Turkey’s Ministry of National Defence, the agency said the ships departed the ports of Odesa and Chernomorsk on Wednesday morning. They were carrying sunflower meal, sunflower oil and corn, it said. On Tuesday, the first ship to depart Ukraine carrying wheat under the terms of a grain export deal agreed last month docked in Syria. Since 1 August, a total of 21 ships carrying agricultural products have left Ukraine. At least 12 Russians have been killed in a strike on a base in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka, according to the Ukrainian military. Footage posted to Telegram by the State Border Guard Service showed numerous burnt-out trucks, collapsed buildings, and debris. “The base of the occupiers was destroyed in Nova Kakhovka,” the post read. “At least 12 Rashists [supporters of Russian militarism] were liquidated.” A “freeze” of the conflict in Ukraine of the sort that followed the Russian occupation in Donbas is currently not possible, the Ukrainian defence minister has said. Speaking to the Ukrainian-language arm of US outlet Voice of America, Oleksiy Reznikov said: “I don’t think that the option of freezing is possible. “The option of reducing activity is possible, depending on the season. And again, modern war is a war of resources. “Resources, of course, are being depleted on both sides. And, accordingly, each side needs time to recover.” Reznikov also claimed that Russian forces had lost at least a third of their combat capacity since the start of the invasion in February. Russia expects its average price for gas exports to more than double over the course of this year, according to economy ministry forecasts seen by Reuters. The figures suggested that the average price charged by state-owned energy giant Gazprom in 2022 would be $730 (£605) per 1,000 cubic metres, up from $305 (£253) in 2021. Based on those forecasts, the ministry expects Russia to earn $338bn (£280bn) and $256bn (£213bn) from its total energy exports this year and next, respectively, up from $244bn (£202bn) in 2021. The forecast also said that, after this year, prices would gradually fall until the end of 2025. The reduced supply of Russian gas to Europe since the invasion of Ukraine has seen prices surge. Gazprom has said supplies to China are increasing, but Europe remains by far the largest market for Russian gas. Explosions have been heard near a Russian command centre in the occupied city of Melitopol, according to the city’s mayor. Writing on Telegram, Ivan Fedorov said that a “loud explosion rang out near the enemy’s lair” in the centre of the city. “Let me remind you that one of the commandant’s offices of the occupiers is located here,” he said. “The earth will burn under the occupiers - this unshakable truth is proven every day by our soldiers from the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the south of Ukraine.” Melitopol is located in the southern Zaporizhzhia region near Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. Fedorov added that he was still waiting for further details of any losses sustained by Russian forces. Russia has not yet commented on the explosions and the Guardian was not able to independently verify the claims. The top official in Russian-annexed Crimea has claimed the FSB security service has broken up what he described as a six-person terrorist cell of a banned Islamist group. It comes a day after a series of strikes in the region destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase. “All of them are detained. The activities of the terrorists were coordinated, as one would expect, from the territory of the terrorist state of Ukraine,” said Sergei Aksyonov on Telegram. He claimed the detainees were members of Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is banned in Russia. Russia earlier said the strikes had been carried out by saboteurs. The attack followed similar strikes last week on a Russian military base in Crimea, with satellite images showing around nine warplanes had been damaged or destroyed. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attacks, but speaking about them to the Guardian a key adviser to President Zelenskiy said that “Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves”. The mayor of the village of Verkhnyo Rogachytsk in the Kherson region has been kidnapped, the deputy chair of the regional council has said. Writing on Telegram, Yuri Sobolevsky said Svitlana Ivanivna was taken from her home at around 11am on Tuesday. He said it was not known where she had been taken, though speculated it would be the nearby port city of Kakhovka. “She rejected all offers to cooperate with the orcs,” he added. It is just past 1pm in Ukraine. Here is what you may have missed: Russian military leaders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” about security in Crimea after reported explosions yesterday, a British intelligence update said. Posting on Twitter, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that both Russian and Ukrainian authorities admitted that an ammunition dump exploded on Tuesday near Dzhankoi in the north of the region and that a nearby railway and sub-station were also damaged. The update said that the Russian media also reported smoke rising near the Gvardeyskoye Airbase. And while the “the cause of these incidents and the extent of the damage is not yet clear”, Russian commanders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” with security in the region that Russia annexed in 2014. In the Donetsk region at the forefront of the Russian offensive, two civilians were killed and seven others were wounded by recent Russian shelling of several towns and villages. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, confirmed the latest casualties on Telegram. The area has been the subject of heavy shelling by the Russian military in recent weeks as they try to make tactical advances in the Donbas region. A recreation centre has been destroyed and three people injured after Russian shelling in Odesa, a top official has said. Sergey Bratchuk, a representative of the Odessa military administration, said a fire broke out and nearby buildings were damaged after the attack. In a post on the Telegram messaging app he said the damage was caused by two enemy rockets. A rescue operation is continuing, he added. Mayor of Lviv Andriy Sadovyi has warned residents in the western city to prepare for a tough winter. In a video posted to his social media accounts, he said: “It’s likely that we’re in for a difficult winter. It’s logical - there can’t be anything simple in a country that fights for its independence. But we have to be prepared for everything.” He added that the city’s authorities have worked on an action plan for any emergencies “that may arise as a result of an enemy attack.” Ukraine has hinted it was behind a series of mysterious and devastating strikes in occupied Crimea that destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase. Several explosions on Tuesday appeared to have destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an electricity substation about 125 miles (200km) from the frontline with Ukrainian forces. Russia blamed saboteurs for orchestrating the series of explosions. There could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to the strikes in Crimea, a key adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine is engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday. UN secretary-general António Guterres, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. Ukraine’s nuclear operator reported what it called an “unprecedented” cyberattack on its website, but said its operations have not been disrupted. “On August 16, 2022, the most powerful cyberattack since the start of the Russian invasion occurred against Energoatom’s website,” the operator said, adding it “was attacked from Russian territory”. North Korea and the Russian-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine will develop “equally beneficial bilateral cooperation”, Donetsk leader Denis Pushilin said in a letter to Kim Jong Un, North Korean state media reported on Wednesday. The first ship to depart Ukraine under a grain export deal docked in Syria on Tuesday, according to a shipping source and satellite data. Another ship carrying the first cargo of food aid bound for Africa also left Ukraine’s ports. Russia’s defence ministry has warned Britain against a planned spy plane flight over Russian territory, saying its air force has been given orders to prevent an intrusion. The ministry said the UK sent a notice informing about a planned flight of an RC-135 reconnaissance plane along a route that partly passes over Russian territory. “We regard this action as a deliberate provocation,” the ministry said. Estonian authorities removed a Soviet-era tank from its pedestal in the eastern city of Narva, the most significant removal yet out of an estimated 200 to 400 such monuments that the government has pledged to take down by the end of the year. “No one wants to see our militant and hostile neighbour foment tensions in our home,” prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said on Tuesday. Estonia will also this week close its border to more than 50,000 Russians with previously issued visas. Finland announced it will cut the number of visas it issues to Russians to 10% of current volumes from 1 September after Russian tourists begun using the country as a gateway to European holiday destinations. Finland will also join the Baltic states in jointly proposing the discontinuation of an EU visa facilitation agreement with Russia that makes it easier and cheaper for Russians to travel to and within the EU, foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said. Donald McRae interviews Ukrainian heavyweight boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk as he prepares to face Britain’s Anthony Joshua in a rematch on Saturday: It was the day she turned 12 and so of course she cried a bit,” Oleksandr Usyk says quietly as he remembers how his daughter Yelizaveta’s birthday was overshadowed earlier this year, on 24 February, the day that Russia invaded Ukraine. The world heavyweight champion runs his hand through his damp hair, which is cut in the style of a Cossack warrior, and for a moment it feels as if he is back home on that terrible winter morning when the first bombs rained down. “My wife spoke to her, explaining what had happened, and soon my daughter understood very well what we are all facing in Ukraine,” Usyk says. “It was difficult but she got it and the main thing is that she is safe now. She will be OK.” On a ferociously hot Saturday evening for him in Dubai, almost six months since that abandoned birthday party, the ominous shadow of war still hangs over Usyk as he prepares to defend his IBF, WBA and WBO titles against Anthony Joshua. This coming Saturday night in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Usyk and Joshua will step into the ring for their fascinating rematch.

These latest pictures from the newswires show the damage from the Russian missile attacks on the southern region of Odesa we reported earlier. Sergey Bratchuk, a representative of the Odessa military administration, said three people were injured, a fire broke out and nearby buildings were damaged after the attack overnight. Dan Sabbagh and Luke Harding report for us from Kyiv: Ukraine is engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories, according to a key adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Mykhailo Podolyak told the Guardian there could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to Tuesday’s mysterious strikes on a railway junction and an airbase in Crimea, as well as last week’s hit on Russian warplanes at the peninsula’s Saky aerodrome. Russia said a fire on Tuesday had set off explosions at a munitions depot in the Dzhankoi district of Crimea – an incident that Podolyak said was a reminder that “Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves”.

Denis Pushilin made the pledge in a message congratulating Kim on the 15 August Korean liberation day, North Korean state news agency KCNA reported, two days after reporting a similar message from Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to Kim. “The people of the Donbas region, too, are fighting to regain their freedom and justice of history today just as the Korean people did 77 years ago,” the report cited Pushilin’s letter as saying. “The message expressed the conviction that an equally beneficial bilateral cooperation agreeing with the interests of the peoples of the two countries will be achieved between the People’s Republic of Donetsk and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” KCNA added, using the official name of North Korea.

Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesperson for the Odesa regional administration, reported that Russian forces launched several missiles at the region, injuring three. Ukraine’s armed forces also provided an update, saying the missiles destroyed a recreation centre and several private buildings. A comparison of satellite images taken by US company Planet Labs shows the aftermath of Tuesday’s explosions at a Russian ammunition depot in Crimea. Kirill Ovsyany, a journalist from the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty, posted the images to Twitter. North Korea and the Russian-occupied Donetsk region of Ukraine will develop “equally beneficial bilateral cooperation”, its self-appointed leader has said in a letter to Kim Jong-un, according to state media. Denis Pushilin made the pledge in a message congratulating Kim on the 15 August Korean liberation day, North Korean state news agency KCNA reported, two days after reporting a similar message from Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to Kim. “The people of the Donbas region, too, are fighting to regain their freedom and justice of history today just as the Korean people did 77 years ago,” the report cited Pushilin’s letter as saying. “The message expressed the conviction that an equally beneficial bilateral cooperation agreeing with the interests of the peoples of the two countries will be achieved between the People’s Republic of Donetsk and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” KCNA added, using the official name of North Korea. Pushilin has previously said he hoped for “fruitful cooperation” and increased trade with North Korea. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, 20,500 Jewish people are believed to have emigrated from Russia, according to Israeli Jewish agency Sokhnut. The agency said around 165,000 people of Jewish origin lived in Russia before the Russian invasion, as cited by the BBC. Moscow’s chief Rabbi, Pinchas Goldschmidt, resigned from the position on 6 July, a role he held for almost 30 years. Two weeks after the start of the war, Goldschmidt and his family left Russia, first going to Hungary and then to Israel. He then resigned and opposed the war with Ukraine. I felt that I had to do something to show that I had nothing to do with and did not agree with the invasion of Ukraine. But if I had done this while I was staying in Moscow, I would have put myself in danger,” Goldschmidt said. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, will travel to Ukraine to meet its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Turkish president, Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday, it has been announced. The leaders will review the UN-backed grain export deal and discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” as well as the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Lviv in western Ukraine. On Friday, Guterres will visit the Black Sea port of Odesa, where grain exports have resumed. On Saturday, the top UN official will visit the Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul, which is made up of Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN. officials overseeing the Black Sea exports of Ukraine grain and fertiliser. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, will travel to Ukraine to meet its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Turkish president, Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday. The leaders will review the UN-backed grain export deal and discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” as well as the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is 7.30am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Ukraine has hinted it was behind a series of mysterious and devastating strikes in occupied Crimea that destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase. Several explosions on Tuesday appeared to have destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an electricity substation about 125 miles (200km) from the frontline with Ukrainian forces. Russia blamed saboteurs for orchestrating the series of explosions. There could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to the strikes in Crimea, a key adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine is engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday. UN secretary-general António Guterres, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. Ukraine’s nuclear operator reported what it called an “unprecedented” cyberattack on its website, but said its operations have not been disrupted. “On August 16, 2022, the most powerful cyberattack since the start of the Russian invasion occurred against Energoatom’s website,” the operator said, adding it “was attacked from Russian territory”. North Korea and the Russian-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine will develop “equally beneficial bilateral cooperation”, Donetsk leader Denis Pushilin said in a letter to Kim Jong Un, North Korean state media reported on Wednesday. The first ship to depart Ukraine under a grain export deal docked in Syria on Tuesday, according to a shipping source and satellite data. Another ship carrying the first cargo of food aid bound for Africa also left Ukraine’s ports. Russia’s defence ministry has warned Britain against a planned spy plane flight over Russian territory, saying its air force has been given orders to prevent an intrusion. The ministry said the UK sent a notice informing about a planned flight of an RC-135 reconnaissance plane along a route that partly passes over Russian territory. “We regard this action as a deliberate provocation,” the ministry said. Estonian authorities removed a Soviet-era tank from its pedestal in the eastern city of Narva, the most significant removal yet out of an estimated 200 to 400 such monuments that the government has pledged to take down by the end of the year. “No one wants to see our militant and hostile neighbour foment tensions in our home,” prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said on Tuesday. Estonia will also this week close its border to more than 50,000 Russians with previously issued visas. Finland announced it will cut the number of visas it issues to Russians to 10% of current volumes from 1 September after Russian tourists begun using the country as a gateway to European holiday destinations. Finland will also join the Baltic states in jointly proposing the discontinuation of an EU visa facilitation agreement with Russia that makes it easier and cheaper for Russians to travel to and within the EU, foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/17/zelenskiy-urges-west-speed-up-arms-support-ukraine-russia-offensive","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-17T18:08:07Z","webTitle":" Zelenskiy urges west to speed up arms support to head off Russia offensive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/17/zelenskiy-urges-west-speed-up-arms-support-ukraine-russia-offensive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/17/zelenskiy-urges-west-speed-up-arms-support-ukraine-russia-offensive","fields":{"headline":" Zelenskiy urges west to speed up arms support to head off Russia offensive","bodyText":"The west needs to hurry up its support for Ukraine as Vladimir Putin will gain a military advantage unless arms deliveries and further sanctions arrive soon, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in a video address to world leaders at a security conference in Munich in the face of mounting fears that Russia is planning a new offensive. “We need to hurry up. We need speed – speed of our agreements, speed of our delivery … speed of decisions to limit Russian potential,” the Ukrainian president said. “There is no alternative to speed because it is speed that life depends on.” He added: “Delay has always been and still is a mistake”. His address came just days before the anniversary on 24 February of Moscow sending its forces into the country and unleashing the biggest war in Europe since the 1940s. Zelenskiy accepted Russia was trying to mount an offensive, mainly in the south, partly by attacking civilian and energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, he said, neighbouring Belarus would make a mistake of historic proportions if it joined in the Russian offensive, and claimed surveys showed 80% of the country did not wish to join the war. Trying to sound an optimistic note and taking up the theme of the conference, “David on the Dnipro”, Zelenskiy said his country had the courage to defeat Goliath with a slingshot. But for this to succeed, he said, the slingshot had to become stronger and faster. “Goliath has already started to lose. Goliath will definitely fall this year,” he said. He said since he last spoke to the MSC he had proven that his country could regain lost territory, including 1,000 cities and villages, but took a swipe at the western countries that had only sent weapons to Ukraine after it had been invaded by Russia. He warned that possible consequences of delay could be a Russian invasion of Moldova, or Russia’s ally Iran receiving enriched uranium. Speaking immediately afterwards, however, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, gave Zelenskiy an indirect rebuff, saying caution was better than hasty decisions and unity was better than going it alone. Scholz said Europe was in uncharted territory and there was “no blueprint for confronting a nuclear power waging an imperialist war of aggression here on European soil”. That made it vital to avoid an unintended escalation, requiring carefully weighed decisions. More than 100 world leaders and diplomats, including the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, are attending the Munich security conference, and from the opening speeches it was clear Europe is now expecting a prolonged conflict requiring further expense and sanctions. Scholz said he was the biggest supplier of weapons in continental Europe, and turned the tables on some of his critics, pointing out he had provided German Leopard tanks, but few others had done so. “All those who can supply main battle tanks should really do so,” he said. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France was ready for a prolonged conflict and that “we must collectively be credible in our ability to last in this effort”. He urged allies to support Ukraine to launch a counteroffensive, “which alone can allow credible negotiations, determined by Ukraine, its authorities and its people”. However, he returned to a theme that has previously alienated some supporters of Ukraine, saying: “This is a war that is a consequence of the fact that no one properly digested the end of the cold war – neither Europe nor Russia.” Saying he was not justifying Russia’s illegal actions, he said the west had assumed Russia could change overnight, while the deep reason for its aggression was resentment of what had happened to the Soviet Union and its obsession with the end of empire. Macron admitted the world’s response to war showed the need to rebalance the the global order and make it more inclusive. “I am struck by how we have lost the trust of the global south he said. He advised Russia to move away from neo-imperialism. He added: “No one can change geography. Russia is part of Europe. No one can solve this dilemma. There is no long-term peace in our continent until this problem is solved reasonably.” In his address on Saturday, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will say now is the time to double down on military support for Ukraine, including advanced Nato standard capabilities that the country will need for the future. The war, he is due to say, is not about just Ukraine, “but the security and sovereignty of every nation”. The UK is due to mark the first anniversary of invasion next Friday by holding a national minute’s silence. The Munich security conference has had a tradition going back decades of inviting senior leaders from states hostile, or ambivalent, towards the west, but has this year taken the unusual decision to exclude any representatives from Iran or Russia. Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, responded to his exclusion by setting a Moscow foreign policy goal of ending what he said was the west’s diplomatic monopoly. The Kremlin on Friday accused the US of inciting Ukraine to escalate the war by condoning attacks on Crimea, saying Washington was now directly involved in the conflict because “crazy people” had dreams of defeating Russia. The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, is due to give an address at the conference and his speech will be watched closely to see how far he is willing to go, in distancing himself from Russia’s invasion, and in seeking out a new, post-Covid trading relationship with the west. He is expected to meet the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who is likely to urge him to do more to criticise the invasion of Ukrainian sovereign territory. A planned trip by Blinken to Beijing was cancelled earlier this month over the Chinese spy balloon controversy. The world leaders at Munich will go through a lightning round of bilateral meetings, including talks between Harris and Sunak. It is the second year in a row that the US vice-president has been given the chance to showcase her international diplomatic skills at the Munich conference, which used to be a natural venue for the president, Joe Biden, when he was chair of the Senate foreign affairs committee. European leaders will be using the weekend to speak to the newly elected Republican leadership of the House of Representatives. It is expected that G7 foreign ministers will also meet on the sidelines of the conference on Saturday to discuss next steps in Ukraine and how to address the future of the Iran nuclear deal. Biden is due in Poland on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/05/he-literally-had-30-seconds-an-australian-couples-desperate-fight-to-flee-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T22:52:27Z","webTitle":"‘He literally had 30 seconds’: an Australian couple’s desperate fight to flee Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/he-literally-had-30-seconds-an-australian-couples-desperate-fight-to-flee-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/05/he-literally-had-30-seconds-an-australian-couples-desperate-fight-to-flee-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"‘He literally had 30 seconds’: an Australian couple’s desperate fight to flee Ukraine","bodyText":"Four days ago Tasmanians Rachel Lehmann Ware and her husband, Duncan, received the call. They had spent the past few nights in the basement of the school they worked in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital at the heart of the Russian invasion. The couple and another teacher had 30 minutes to get to the other side of the city. It was their only hope to get out. “I don’t know what the CEO did to get them, but he got us seats on the train and it’s almost impossible. We had 30 minutes to get there,” Lehmann Ware said. “We got there with literally 30 seconds to go. The driver, he was screeching down the streets of Kyiv.” The couple is now safely in Chernivtsi, a city in western Ukraine that is acting as a short-term haven for people trying to cross the border to Romania or Moldova. Lehmann Ware and her husband are from Huonville in Tasmania. They have spent the past five years teaching in different countries – in July last year, they moved to Kyiv and fell in love with the vibrant city. As war rumours swirled, they were reluctant to leave their school community. Just as the Russians were about to advance on the country, the couple caught Covid. “Dfat called us, they asked when were you diagnosed. [We told them] and they went ‘oh shit’. We didn’t have an option. We could not get out because we had Covid.” With their two cats, the pair bunkered down in the school basement with other members of the staff. They planned to leave by car before it became too unsafe. Each night was interrupted with the sound of explosions as Russian missiles were shot down. Some made it through. No one slept. A 64km convoy of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles had just been spotted advancing up the road to the capital. Military analysts said it was poised to attack. They weren’t sure when they would leave the basement, or what state their city would be in when they did. Then the phone rang. “One of our security guards got us out, I can’t even remember what day it was. He’s now in the militia,” Lehmann Ware said. Although the station was packed with people – many of them trying desperately to get out of the city – there was still a sense of community, she said. People wanted to help each other. “I was going through the front door, I had lost my party, I was holding my massive cat, Dexter, and a young man from nowhere came up to me, he could see I was panicked, he said ‘Everything is OK, you’re going to be OK’,” she said. Lehmann Ware found her husband but, at the top of the stairs, they got separated in the crowd. There were people everywhere. He yelled at her to go, so she ran to the train. She got on, and out of the blue, their security guard arrived, almost carrying her husband with him. “He literally had about 30 seconds to get on the train, that was it,” she said. On the train, the windows were blacked out for security. Through a crack she watched as they passed bombed villages. The carriage was filled with women and children who had had to leave their husbands behind. “No Ukrainian men, no men, they have to stay. You have little kids and their mothers travelling alone and getting to a border,” she said. “It ended up being an 18-hour train journey on a very, very, very old train. One of the really old Soviet trains. Eighteen hours and the train is just overloaded, people in the hallways with kids, dogs, cats, most people got out Lviv – that’s a major transport hub.” The pair and their two cats are now safe in a hotel. There’s fresh coffee and stable wifi. Back home her parents and 21-year-old daughter are finally sleeping with their phones on silent. Everyone is in shock. “My God I’m exhausted. At the moment, to be honest, I think those of us who are here are suffering from survivors’ guilt. You’re happy you’re here and safe but terrified for the people you’ve left behind. “One of my assistant teachers, I haven’t heard from her since Friday. I feel bad for not being there with them.” In the first seven days of the war, one million people fled Ukraine. UN high commissioner for refugees Filippo Grandi said that in 40 years of working in refugee emergencies, he had rarely seen an exodus as quick as this one. “Hour by hour, minute by minute, more people are fleeing the terrifying reality of violence. Countless have been displaced inside the country,” he said. The borders are busy and the west of the country is covered in snow – making lining up to get over the border a hard task. “It’s snowing and cold. We’ve got these children lining up for five to 20 hours, however long it’s taking. It’s horrendous,” she said. “Dfat and Australian crisis support group have been amazing. They’re in constant contact and all of them have said they’ll be there ready for us. Lehmann Ware and her husband are still working out what to do – how to get home. “We make a plan it doesn’t work, we just don’t know, we are hoping to get across tomorrow but we just don’t know. “It’s so important the world knows what’s happening here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-warns-of-new-missile-attacks-russia-may-be-preparing-to-leave-zaporizhzhia-plant-nuclear-chief-says","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T19:00:08Z","webTitle":"Ukraine braced for new Russian missile strikes targeting power grid as sporadic shelling of cities continues – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-warns-of-new-missile-attacks-russia-may-be-preparing-to-leave-zaporizhzhia-plant-nuclear-chief-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-warns-of-new-missile-attacks-russia-may-be-preparing-to-leave-zaporizhzhia-plant-nuclear-chief-says","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine braced for new Russian missile strikes targeting power grid as sporadic shelling of cities continues – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut has descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily. As Russia moved fresh formations to the area in recent weeks, neither Russian or Ukrainian forces were able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting Russian forces continue to shell residential infrastructure and housing in the recently liberated city of Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military. In its latest update, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Russian troops were digging trenches and fortifying their positions in preparation for a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive in eastern Kherson. Russians are sporadically shelling cities with no apparent strategic aim other than to cause casualties. The Guardian visited a residential district in Dnipro, where a series of houses were destroyed by a fragmentation warhead, designed to inflict maximum casualties, which had landed on Saturday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed Russia will soon launch a series of new missile strikes on his country, warning his defence forces and citizens to prepare for the attack. He gave the ominous caution in his Sunday evening address. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has warned that Russia will probably continue to attack Ukraine’s power grid, gas infrastructure and basic services. He said Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, was trying to use “the winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine”. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office has said 329 children are currently considered missing in Ukraine, while 12,034 have been deported to Russia. According to the Ukrainian government’s children of war portal, 440 children have been killed as a result of Russia’s war and 851 children are now reported as injured. Russia has “unilaterally postponed” talks with the US aimed at resuming nuclear weapons inspections in Cairo this week, a US state department spokesperson confirmed. Talks between US and Russian officials were scheduled to begin tomorrow. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed in a statement that talks would no longer take place this week. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. The Kremlin has denied the reports. Foreign ministers of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden visited Kyiv today to show support for Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, vowed that Ukraine would win despite Russia’s “barbaric brutality”. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine’s prime minister, has visited Downing Street during her visit to London to discuss the prevention of sexual violence in conflicts. Zelenska met with Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, and prime minister Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty. Russia’s foreign ministry said it has summoned the Norwegian ambassador after a number of Russian citizens were arrested over the use of drones. Nearly a dozen Russians have been arrested in Norway in recent weeks or violating the flight ban or the ban on photographing sites deemed sensitive. The arrests, which Russia has described as “politically motivated” and Norway said were legal, comes as Oslo has heightened security following suspected sabotage on the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said: It was noted that the sentences against the Russians were politically motivated and had nothing to do with the principles of fair and impartial justice. A spokesperson for Norway’s foreign ministry, Lars Gjemble, said after the summoning: Our ambassador took the opportunity to inform [Russia] of Norwegian legislation on sanctions. He added: He also reviewed the cases that are currently being processed in Norwegian courts. The meeting was held in a good tone Russia has launched more than 16,000 missile attacks at Ukraine since the war began, 97% of which were civilian targets, according to Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov. The mayor of Mykolaiv, Oleksandr Sienkievych, has said there will be no drinking water supply to the southern Ukrainian city after Russian forces damaged a pumping station in the neighbouring Kherson region. In a post to Telegram, he said: During a missile attack, Russian terrorists damaged a pumping station of MKP Mykolaivvodokanal, located in the Kherson region. Therefore, for an indefinite period of time, we are forced to supply technical water to the city from the Bug estuary. He said the city’s water supply had been repaired just one week after Kherson was liberated by Ukrainian troops, adding: But we are dealing with real terrorists who are powerless against our military, and therefore they fight with the civilian population. He said repair work continued on networks that were destroyed by salt water. As soon as the security situation allows, we will promptly restore the pumping station and return drinking water to Mykolaiv. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has met Olena Zelenska during her visit to London to discuss the prevention of sexual violence in conflicts. Cleverly tweeted a photo of the pair, and praised Zelenska’s efforts to highlight the “horrific use of sexual violence by Russian forces”. He added: The UK stands with Ukraine, and with all survivors of these despicable crimes. The Ukrainian first lady shared a video of the pair meeting earlier this afternoon, expressing “gratitude” to Cleverly for his support of Ukraine. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine’s prime minister, has visited Downing Street during her visit to London to discuss the prevention of sexual violence in conflicts. Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, welcomed Zelenska on the pavement outside No 10 Downing Street as the pair exchanged a hug before walking inside the building. Downing Street said Sunak briefly dropped into the meeting between his wife and Zelenska. Zelenska is expected to address MPs and peers tomorrow as part of her visit to London, where she also took part in an international conference on preventing sexual violence during conflicts. At the conference, Zelenska spoke about sexual violence being perpetrated “systematically and openly” as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues. She said: Sexual violence is the most cruel, most animalistic way to prove mastership over someone. And for victims of this kind of violence, it is difficult to testify in war times because nobody feels safe. This is another instrument that they’re using as their weaponry. This is another weapon in their arsenal in this war and conflict. Russian servicemen were “very open” about using sexual violence as their weaponry, she said. She added: That’s why it’s extremely important to recognise this as a war crime and to hold all of the perpetrators accountable. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has warned that Russia will probably continue to attack Ukraine’s power grid, gas infrastructure and basic services. Speaking to reporters in Bucharest ahead of a two-day meeting of Nato foreign ministers, he said: Doing that when we enter winter demonstrates that President (Vladimir) Putin is now trying to use ... the winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine. In his Sunday night address, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned Ukrainians to prepare for a series of new Russian missile strikes on the country. He said: We understand that terrorists are preparing new strikes. We know that for sure. And as long as they have missiles, they won’t stop, unfortunately.” Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut has descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily, as neither Russian or Ukrainian forces were able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting. As Russia moved fresh formations to the area in recent weeks, including reinforcements previously in the Kherson region, the fighting in the Bakhmut sector has descended into trench warfare reminiscent of the first world war. Over the weekend, images emerged of Ukrainian soldiers in flooded, muddy trenches and battlefields dotted with the stumps of trees cut down by withering artillery barrages. Heavy fighting continued on Monday around Soledar, with mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner private military corporation – which includes pardoned convicts – in the forefront. Ukraine’s presidential office said on Monday that at least four civilians had been killed and 11 others wounded in the latest Russian attacks. It said intense fighting was continuing along the frontline in the east, with the Russians shelling Bakhmut and Toretsk at the epicentre of the fighting. “People are sheltering in the basements, many of which are filled by water,” said the governor of Donetsk, Pavlo Kyrylenko. They have been living in catastrophic conditions without power or heating. The focus of much of the recent fighting, however, has been the now-shattered town of Bakhmut itself, largely abandoned by its 70,000 residents, with both sides sending reinforcements for a battle that has continued relentlessly since the summer as Moscow has sought to secure a victory after a series of battlefield setbacks and retreats. Read the full story here: It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces are continuing to shell residential infrastructure and housing in the recently liberated city of Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military.

The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. The Kremlin has denied the reports. Foreign ministers of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden are in Kyiv today to show support for Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, vowed that Ukraine would win despite Russia’s “barbaric brutality”. The US has put forward a “significant” proposal for a deal to free the jailed basketball star Brittney Griner and former marine Paul Whelan, the chargée d’affaires of the US mission to Russia, Elizabeth Rood, said. She told Russia’s state-owned RIA news agency that Moscow had not provided a “serious response” to any of its proposals. The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted on to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Ukraine is bracing for another mass missile attack this week, but in between these major salvos aimed at the power grid, the Russians are sporadically shelling cities with no apparent strategic aim other than to cause casualties. In a district of small detached houses in Dnipro, the Reva family were sifting through the wreckage of their home today. The house and four others around it had been destroyed by a shell or missile which had landed on Saturday, but the ruins burned right through Sunday and this was the first time they could get close. It was a fragmentation warhead, designed to inflict maximum casualties, peppering surviving walls with shrapnel and leaving two centimetre diameter holes in metal girders. The bomb fell close to a church and a school, blowing out all its windows, but amazingly no one was killed. Vladyslav Reva does not usually work on a Saturday but had been called out to work by a client of his construction business. “I was saved by God and my client,” he said. His wife, Iryna, had been in the study when the bomb landed and the roof caught fire. She was trying to escape when the blast from their exploding gas heater blew her through a window. She is in hospital with concussion and heavy bruising. The only death was the family dog, a 8 year-old American Akita called June, who has been buried in a corner of the charred garden. Vladyslav Leva showed us a picture of the house before destruction, a handsome two-storey home painted a cheerful yellow and landscaped with a line of trees. His son Oleksii said that it was now past salvaging. “We’re not going to rebuild it,” he said. “We’re going to use a bulldozer and destroy it and then start again somewhere else.” Could the Russian aim of such shelling be to demoralise the population? “Well, they failed,” Oleksii said quickly. “Just the opposite,” his father said, and pointing to the charred ruins of his home, he added: “Better this than Russkiy Mir, Russia’s world.” A US State department spokesperson has confirmed that Russia “unilaterally postponed” talks aimed at resuming nuclear weapons inspections in Cairo this week. Talks between US and Russian officials were scheduled to begin tomorrow. The spokesperson said: The United States and the Russian Federation were set to convene a meeting of the New START Treaty’s Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) in Cairo, Egypt, to discuss New START Treaty implementation on Tuesday, November 29. The Russian side informed the United States that Russia has unilaterally postponed the meeting and stated that it would propose new dates. Washington “is ready to reschedule at the earliest possible date” the meeting “as resuming inspections is a priority for sustaining the treaty as an instrument of stability”, the spokesperson added.

Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the Norwegian ambassador over what it said was the politically motivated arrest of Russian citizens for reportedly using drones illegally. “It was noted that the sentences against the Russians were politically motivated and had nothing to do with the principles of fair and impartial justice,” the ministry said in a statement. Several Russian citizens have reportedly been arrested by Norwegian authorities for flying drones near the Arctic border between the two countries or taking photos of classified facilities, as Norway boosts security after suspected sabotage on the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea. Russia has postponed nuclear disarmament talks with the US planned for this week, according to Kommersant newspaper, citing the US embassy. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed in a statement that talks between Moscow and Washington in Cairo would no longer take place this week. Russian forces are continuing to shell residential infrastructure and housing in the recently liberated city of Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military. A 10-year-old boy was injured and hospitalised after Russian shelling on the town of Chornobayivka in Kherson region, police said. Hundreds of Ukrainians are fleeing Kherson city just two weeks after its recapture from Russian occupying forces. Moscow’s shelling has killed at least 32 civilians since its forces left the city on 9 November. In its latest update published last night, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Russian troops were digging trenches and fortifying their positions in preparation for a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive in eastern Kherson. Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has met his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in a visit to reaffirm historic ties between the two countries. Tokayev’s visit to the Kremlin today marks his first foreign trip since he secured a second term in a snap election last week. Speaking next to Putin before the talks, Tokayev said: This is my first foreign visit after this event and that in itself has political significance and, of course, a certain symbolism. Russia “is and has always been a strategic partner” to Kazakhstan, he added. Putin said relations between Moscow and Astana had a “special character” and called on a strengthening of economic ties. Foreign ministers of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden are in Kyiv today to show support for Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, tweeted about the visit and vowed that Ukraine would win despite Russia’s “barbaric brutality”. Finland’s Pekka Haavisto tweeted about the “inconsolability of war” and expressed admiration for the “courage and determination” of Ukrainians as they “defend their independence”. Anniken Huitfeldt, Norway’s foreign minister, also shared photos of her visit to the capital and said her country stood in solidarity with Ukraine. Here’s more from that interview with Elizabeth Rood, the chargée d’affaires of the US mission to Russia, who discussed the possibility of a follow-up meeting between the CIA’s director, William Burns, and Russian foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin. The pair met in Ankara earlier this month in a rare high-level meeting, following speculation that some senior US figures wanted Ukraine to enter negotiations with the Kremlin to end the war. The US insisted at the time that it was not engaged in secret peace talks with Moscow without Ukrainian officials being present, but that the main purpose of the encounter was to convey “a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia” and to discuss the cases of Americans held in detention in the country. Speaking to Russia’s state-owned RIA news agency, Rood said: The United States has channels for managing risk with the Russian Federation, particularly nuclear risks, and that was the purpose of CIA director Burns’ meeting with his Russian counterpart. Director Burns did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine. I’m sure if there’s a need for another conversation in that channel, it can happen. There’s not anything scheduled that I know of. A senior American diplomat has said the US put forward a “significant” proposal for a deal to free the basketball star Brittney Griner and former marine Paul Whelan, but that Russia had not provided a “serious response” to any of its proposals. Talks between the US and Russia over the two jailed Americans were continuing through the “designated channel”, Elizabeth Rood, the chargée d’affaires of the US mission to Russia, told Russia’s state-owned RIA news agency. She said: The United States, as we have said, has put a significant proposal on the table. We have followed up on that proposal and we have proposed alternatives. Unfortunately, so far the Russian Federation has not provided a serious response to those proposals. Griner was sentenced in August to nine years in a penal colony after being convicted on drug charges. Her lawyers have confirmed that she was taken earlier this month to a penal colony in the Russian region of Mordovia, the same region where Whelan is serving a 16-year sentence after being convicted of espionage charges that he denies. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Moscow hoped to complete a prisoner swap with the US to return the convicted Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Bout, in an exchange that would probably include Griner. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office has said 329 children are currently considered missing in Ukraine, while 12,034 have been deported to Russia. In a statement posted to Telegram, it said: Data on affected children as of November 28, 2022: 329 are missing, 12,034 – deported, and 7,819 – found. It emphasised that the figures were not final as work was still under way to verify reports coming from the frontline, as well as from occupied and liberated parts of Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian government’s children of war portal, 440 children have been killed as a result of Russia’s war and 851 children are now reported as injured. The prosecutor general’s office reports a total of 1,291 children casualties, with the largest number in regions of Donetsk, Kharkiv and Kyiv. It is not possible to independently verify these figures. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest news from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines so far: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed Russia will soon launch a series of new missile strikes on his country, warning his defence forces and citizens to prepare for the attack. He gave the ominous caution in his Sunday evening address. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar, home to the facility, has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted on to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Russia and the US have ways to manage nuclear risks at the level of intelligence agencies, chargée d’affaires of the US embassy in Moscow Elizabeth Rood told Russia’s state news agency Ria Novosti, adding that for now there were no meetings scheduled. The Kremlin’s spokesperson has denied reports that Russian forces were planning to leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, telling reporters they should not look for signs where there were none. The Kremlin said it welcomed a Vatican offer to provide a negotiating platform to resolve the Ukraine conflict, but that Kyiv’s position made this “impossible”. Pope Francis reiterated 10 days ago that the Vatican was ready to do anything possible to mediate and put an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in an interview with the Italian daily La Stampa. The mayor of Kyiv has traded verbal jabs with Zelenskiy and his allies over how to help residents withstand power cuts. Former professional boxer Vitali Klitschko said 430 “warming centres” were helping residents cope with the effects of Russian attacks on power stations, and more than 100 extra centres were planned in case of extreme conditions. Klitschko said Zelenskiy’s allies had engaged in “manipulation” about the city’s efforts. Hundreds of Ukrainians fled Kherson city on Sunday as Russian shelling intensified. The liberation of Kherson earlier this month marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv, but the population has struggled with a lack of water, heating and electricity. Britain will promise to maintain or increase military aid to Ukraine next year, according to an extract of a speech released by the office of the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, which he plans to deliver on Monday. “We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will maintain or increase our military aid next year. And we will provide new support for air defence,” Sunak will reportedly say. The UK will provide Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to Ukraine as part of its latest aid package. “This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian airstrikes of the war. “We have been restoring electricity generation and supply day after day,” Zelenskiy said in his Sunday night address. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s survival may depend on his value to Vladimir Putin as a future bargaining chip, his chief aide has said. Leonid Volkov, speaking on a visit to London, added that Navalny had lost access to his family and was being permanently detained in a “8 by 12ft” cell after being forced into indefinite solitary confinement by Russian authorities last week. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine.

People walk past a destroyed Russian billboard yesterday in Kherson, Ukraine. In case you missed it, hundreds of Ukrainians streamed out of Kherson city on Sunday to flee Russian shelling, two weeks after its recapture from Russian occupying forces prompted jubilant celebrations. The liberation of Kherson marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv – reconquered after the Russians retreated to the east bank of the Dnipro River. However, since then inhabitants have struggled with no water, heating and electricity, because Moscow’s troops destroyed thermal and power plants before they left. Evacuations began last week amid fears that damage to infrastructure caused by the war was too severe for people to endure over Ukraine’s harsh winter. The exodus has been exacerbated by Russian shelling, which has killed 32 civilians since Russian forces left the city on 9 November. “It is sad that we are leaving our home,” Yevhen Yankov told the Associated Press as a van he was in inched forward. “Now we are free, but we have to leave, because there is shelling, and there are dead among the population.” A BM-21 ‘Grad’ multiple rocket launcher fires towards Russian positions on the frontline near Bakhmut, Donetsk region. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar, home to the facility, has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. Petro Kotin, head of Energoatom, said on national television on Sunday: In recent weeks we are effectively receiving information that signs have appeared that they are possibly preparing to leave the [plant]. One gets the impression they’re packing their bags and stealing everything they can.” The Russian backed administration issued a statement in response on the Telegram messaging app on Monday, saying: The media are actively spreading fakes that Russia is allegedly planning to withdraw from Enerhodar and leave the [nuclear plant]. This information is not true.” The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted on to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Boeing’s proposed system, dubbed Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), is one of about a half-dozen plans for getting new munitions into production for Ukraine and America’s eastern European allies, industry sources told the news agency. GLSDB could be delivered as early as spring 2023, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and three people familiar with the plan. It combines the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) with the M26 rocket motor, both of which are common in US inventories. Although a handful of GLSDB units have already been made, there are many logistical obstacles to formal procurement. The Boeing plan requires a price discovery waiver, exempting the contractor from an in-depth review that ensures the Pentagon is getting the best deal possible. Any arrangement would also require at least six suppliers to expedite shipments of their parts and services to produce the weapon quickly. Although the US has rebuffed requests for the 185-mile (297km) range Atacms missile, the GLSDB’s 94-mile (150km) range would allow Ukraine to hit valuable military targets that have been out of reach and help it continue pressing its counterattacks by disrupting Russian rear areas. GLSDB is made jointly by Saab AB and Boeing Co and has been in development since 2019, well before the invasion, which Russia calls a “special operation”. In October, SAAB chief executive Micael Johansson said of the GLSDB: “We are imminently shortly expecting contracts on that.” According to the document – a Boeing proposal to US European – has small, folding wings that allow it to glide more than 100km if dropped from an aircraft and targets as small as 3ft in diameter. Russia and the US have ways to manage nuclear risks at the level of intelligence agencies, chargée d’affaires of the US embassy in Moscow Elizabeth Rood told Russia’s state news agency Ria Novosti, adding that for now there were no meetings scheduled. A video on RIA’s Telegram channel cited Rood as saying: The United States has channels for managing risk with the Russian Federation, particularly nuclear risks and that was the purpose of CIA director Burns’ meeting with his Russian counterpart. Director Burns did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine.” Rood refers to a meeting CIA director William Burns has with Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russian foreign intelligence, earlier this month where he warned him about the consequences of any Russian use of nuclear weapons. Russia said the issues discussed were “sensitive” and declined to comment on them. Rood said if there is need for another conversation in that channel it can happen. “There is not anything scheduled that I know of.” Russia said after Naryshkin’s meeting with Burns that Moscow was open to more high-level talks with the US, but the Kremlin dismissed the idea of a summit between President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden as “out of the question” for now. Officials from the two countries were set to meet in the Egyptian capital of Cairo from 29 November to 6 December to discuss resuming inspections under the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty, although Moscow has played down the prospect of a quick breakthrough. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed Russia will soon launch a series of new missile strikes on his country, warning his defence forces and citizens to prepare for the attack. He gave the ominous caution in his Sunday evening address: We understand that terrorists are preparing new strikes. We know that for sure.

Industry sources told the Guardian that EDF Energy, the state-owned French operator of Hunterston, decided at a board meeting on Thursday afternoon that the plant would stop generating electricity in late 2021, at least two years earlier than planned. The energy company had hoped to keep generating electricity from the 44-year-old nuclear plant on the Firth of Clyde until 2023, after ploughing more than £200m into repairing the reactor. Hunterston, which first began generating electricity in 1976, has been offline since 2018 after inspectors discovered 350 microscopic cracks in the reactor’s graphite core. In October last year the Ferret, an investigative website, reported that at least 58 fragments and pieces of debris had fallen off the graphite blocks as the cracks worsened. It quoted the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) as saying this had created “significant uncertainty” about the risks of debris blocking channels for cooling the reactor and causing fuel cladding to melt. After a two-year investigation, the ONR said on Thursday that reactor 3 at Hunterston would be allowed to restart as planned, but it would only be allowed to generate electricity for approximately six months. EDF then plans to apply next spring to extend its life for one final six-month run. EDF said it would begin the process of decommissioning Hunterston no later than the first week of 2022. EDF also operates Scotland’s second nuclear power station, Torness, on the east coast south of Edinburgh. Running since 1988, its two reactors can produce up to 1.2GW of electricity. It is due to remain operational until 2030 at the earliest. Hunterston’s closure has reignited concern over energy policy. Both the UK and Scottish governments aim to increase low-carbon energy supplies to help meet climate goals. Gary Smith, the regional secretary of the union GMB Scotland, said the job losses from the closure “would pose massive long-term challenges for what is quite a deprived area of Scotland. The Scottish government now has a huge problem with its energy policy: more imported gas will be burnt to keep the lights on. Renewables on their own won’t do that.” The Scottish National party government in Edinburgh has an anti-nuclear policy but has backed efforts to extend the life of Hunterston and Torness, while phasing out coal-fired power stations and building up renewable sources in Scotland. In 2016 Scotland’s two nuclear stations produced 43% of its electricity. In 2018, the year Hunterston went offline after the reactor cracks were uncovered, that fell to 28%. Richard Dixon, the director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: “In terms of energy security, clearly there’s no problem. Its reactors haven’t been running and the lights haven’t gone out. What’s more urgent now is to build up renewables and energy efficiency, to make sure the gap left by Hunterston is filled by zero-carbon electricity or energy saving.” Simone Rossi, EDF’s UK chief executive, said the decision to shut the nuclear plant “underlines the urgent need for investment in new, low-carbon nuclear power to help Britain achieve net zero and secure the future for its nuclear industry, supply chain and workers.” Across the UK there are eight operational nuclear power plants, which generate a steady supply of electricity about two-thirds of the time. In total they supplied 18.7% of the UK’s electricity in 2018, down from just over 20% the year before. All but one are due to close within the next decade. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said a nuclear programme would help create “tens of thousands of secure, skilled and well-paid jobs” while helping to meet the UK’s future electricity demand, which is projected to quadruple in the coming decades. EDF said in a letter to the local community this month that it had invested more than £200m in investigating whether Hunterston’s graphite reactor would remain safe under a range of worst-case scenarios, including a one-in-10,000-years seismic event, which is much larger than the UK has ever recorded."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/13/french-ministers-urge-totalenergies-to-raise-wages-as-strikes-continue","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T14:47:03Z","webTitle":"French ministers urge oil giant to raise wages as strikes continue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/13/french-ministers-urge-totalenergies-to-raise-wages-as-strikes-continue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/13/french-ministers-urge-totalenergies-to-raise-wages-as-strikes-continue","fields":{"headline":"French ministers urge oil giant to raise wages as strikes continue","bodyText":"France has told the oil giant TotalEnergies it has a duty to raise wages, as the group’s two-week standoff with striking workers drags on, disrupting petrol supplies and causing a crisis for the government. Oil depot and refinery strikes at the French group and the US group ExxonMobil have reduced France’s petrol output by more than 60% in recent days, with one in three petrol stations struggling for fuel. Industrial action spread this week to other energy companies including the nuclear power group EDF, where some workers resumed their sporadic industrial action of recent months. Although the picket line was lifted at a key ExxonMobil refinery at Fos-sur-Mer in the south of France on Thursday afternoon after a pay deal was struck, the leftwing CGT trade union at TotalEnergies voted to continue to blockade five sites across the country. At the heart of the standoff is anger at the cost of living crisis and rising inflation, as the trade union demands that workers should have a share of oil companies’ high profits. The government is under fire from political critics for failing to grasp the seriousness of the strike action for higher salaries, which began last month. TotalEnergies’ bumper profits had caused widespread anger, leading to calls for the group to face a windfall tax. The government has consistently refused, taking the line that companies would redistribute their gains among workers voluntarily. The CGT trade union is seeking an immediate 10% pay rise to help staff struggling with the cost of living, and after a surge in energy prices led to huge profits that allowed the company to pay out an estimated €8bn in dividends and an additional special dividend to investors. Like other major oil companies, TotalEnergies’ profits soared as energy prices rose after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, significantly changed tone on Thursday, saying TotalEnergies had an obligation to raise salaries. He told RTL radio: “If one knows the profits which they made … companies which have the capacity have a duty to raise wages, and Total is one of them”. The French energy minister, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, said: “Total needs to raise salaries.” TotalEnergies then told AFP news agency that it would propose a 6% raise for next year, which was below the CGT’s demand for an immediate 10% retroactive to 1 January 2022. The CGT coordinator at the company, Eric Sellini, responded: “We’re not going to negotiate through the media.” TotalEnergies also proposed giving an “exceptional bonus” to all its workers worldwide, equivalent to a month’s salary. It invited all trade unions to pay talks which would begin late on Thursday night. The government pushed on with the rare and controversial measure of ordering certain refinery staff back to work, targeting the picket line at TotalEnergies for the first time at Dunkirk. “Police came to their homes and made them sign a paper ordering that they come work this afternoon from 2pm until 6am tomorrow,” the FO trade union official at the Dunkirk site, Clement Mortier, told AFP news agency. The CGT trade union has launched a legal challenge after several workers were requisitioned at another site in northern France on Wednesday. The crisis is seen as damaging for the government amid long and angry tailbacks at petrol stations and fears of empty tanks among some workers including care assistants to elderly people, who depend on their cars, as well as hauliers and refrigerated lorries for food deliveries. In northern France, which has been badly affected, some school transport had to stop. The office of the prime minister, Élisabeth’s Borne, cited a “real economic threat” for much of northern France, which relies heavily on agriculture, fishing and industry. The CGT trade union said it would push for extending the strike to other sectors, potentially with a broader strike next Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2022/mar/04/bbc-website-blocked-in-russia-as-shortwave-radio-brought-back-to-cover-ukraine-war","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T04:32:39Z","webTitle":"BBC website blocked in Russia as shortwave radio brought back to cover Ukraine war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/04/bbc-website-blocked-in-russia-as-shortwave-radio-brought-back-to-cover-ukraine-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/mar/04/bbc-website-blocked-in-russia-as-shortwave-radio-brought-back-to-cover-ukraine-war","fields":{"headline":"BBC website blocked in Russia as shortwave radio brought back to cover Ukraine war","bodyText":"Access to BBC websites has been restricted in Russia, hours after the corporation brought back its shortwave radio service in Ukraine and Russia to ensure civilians in both countries can access news during the invasion. State communications watchdog Roskomnadzor restricted access to BBC Russia’s online presence, as well as Radio Liberty and the Meduza media outlet, the state-owned Russian RIA news agency reported on Friday. On Friday, Globalcheck, a service that tracks internet censorship in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), reported that the availability of the entire BBC website was at 17% of normal levels in Russia, which suggested some services had been blocked. Later on Friday, the BBC shared methods to circumvent the ban, including the Pisphon app or the Tor browser. BBC Russia also reported that Meta, formerly known as Facebook, also appeared to be blocked, as was Google Play. The signs the BBC was being blocked emerged hours after the BBC’s decision to revert to a mostly obsolete form of broadcasting, broadcasting four hours of its world service, read in English, to Ukraine and parts of Russia each day. “It’s often said truth is the first casualty of war,” BBC director general Tim Davie said in announcing the move on Thursday. “In a conflict where disinformation and propaganda is rife, there is a clear need for factual and independent news people can trust … millions more Russians are turning to the BBC.” The German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle also reported in Russian that the BBC site was not working in Russia. The BBC’s shortwave radio broadcast can be found on 15735 kHz from 4pm to 6pm and on 5875 kHz from 10pm to midnight, Ukraine time. The BBC’s move to bring back shortwave came days after Russia launched two missiles on Kyiv’s TV tower, killing five people and knocking out some access to news and broadcasts. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, wrote on Twitter that the Kremlin was preparing to cut off communications and spread “massive fake messages that the country’s leadership has given up”. Russia has clamped down on public dissent at home, while Kremlin-backed media organisations such as RT have been pulled internationally. The Kremlin has complained about the BBC’s coverage of the invasion, with Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claiming without evidence that the BBC “plays a determined role in undermining the Russian stability and security”. Zakharova also claimed Russia had been the victim of “unprecedented information terrorism” that was “creating hysteria around Ukrainian events”. The BBC has reported huge increases in its audiences in Ukraine and Russia since the invasion began. In the last week of February, viewership of BBC’s Ukrainian language website more than doubled from a year earlier to 3.9 million visitors. Its Russian-language website has reached a record 10.7 million visitors over the past week, more than tripling its weekly 2022 average. Shortwave radio uses frequencies that can travel long distances and are accessible on portable radios, making it the go-to method to reach listeners in conflict zones throughout history. Shortwave was used extensively in Europe to broadcast propaganda during the second world war, and usage peaked during the cold war.

Residents of the two southern regions, which were shelled regularly by Russian forces in the past months, have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, said Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. The government would provide transportation, accommodation and medical care, she added. The evacuations come just over a week after Ukraine retook the city of Kherson – which remains close to the frontline – and areas around it. The liberation marked a major battlefield gain, while the evacuations highlight the difficulties Ukraine is facing after heavy Russian shelling of its power infrastructure as winter sets in. The war’s southern front has been the recent focus of efforts for both Russian and Ukrainian forces before Russia’s retreat from Kherson. More recently, however, Moscow appears to be building up forces and increasing its military efforts on the eastern Donbas front where the two sides have been locked in a bitter and inconclusive struggle for months, not least around the key town of Bakhmut. With the Kremlin sending fresh reinforcements to the area, as well as troops previously deployed in the south, the Russian armed forces and the Wagner mercenary group have begun intensifying efforts to break that long and bloody stalemate, with unconfirmed reports of the use of incendiary munitions against Ukrainian positions. Russia has been pounding Ukraine’s power grid and other infrastructure from the air, causing widespread blackouts and leaving millions of Ukrainians without heat, power or water as frigid cold and snow blankets the capital, Kyiv, and other cities. Four-hour or longer power outages were expected in 15 Ukrainian regions on Monday, according to Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the head of the state grid operator, Ukrenergo. More than 40% of Ukraine’s energy facilities were damaged by Russian missile strikes in recent weeks. While the situation in the recently liberated areas of the south led to the evacuations announcement, it is barely better in many other parts of the country. The situation in Kyiv and other major cities has deteriorated drastically after the largest missile attack on the country’s power grid on Tuesday. Ukrenergo said 40% of Ukrainians were experiencing difficulties because of damage to at least 15 major energy hubs across Ukraine. Warning that electricity outages could last anywhere from several hours to several days, it added: “Resilience and courage are what we need this winter.” The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has also stressed the need to be ready and resilient in the face of a potential blackout. “Worst-case scenario. Actually, I don’t like to talk about that, but I have to be prepared if we [do not] have electricity, blackout, no water, no heating, no services and no communication,” he said on Friday. Ukrenergo said: “Thousands of kilometres of key high-voltage lines are not working,” affecting the entire country. News of the evacuations came as a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant had caused widespread damage, but concluded that there were no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns at the Russian-held facility. “They were able to confirm that – despite the severity of the shelling – key equipment remained intact and there were no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns,” the UN agency said in a statement. Repeated shelling of the Zaporizhzhia complex has raised concerns about a grave accident 310 miles (500km) from the site of the world’s worst nuclear power plant accident, at Chernobyl in 1986. The Zaporizhzhia plant provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times. It has six Soviet-designed water-cooled and water-moderated reactors containing uranium-235. The reactors are shut down but there is a risk that nuclear fuel could overheat if the power driving the cooling systems is cut. Heavy fighting continues in Kherson city, where there were a series of explosions on Monday, with one person killed and four others were taken to hospital as a result of shelling, according to the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko. Russia’s forces continue to strengthen defences along the east bank of the Dnipro River and to build up additional defensive lines deep inside Russian-held territory. “Artillery duels continue, the fight continues,” said Dmytro Pletentchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military in the area. “Kherson is now on the frontline.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/15/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-173-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T18:15:58Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 173 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-173-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/15/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-173-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 173 of the invasion","bodyText":"At least three civilians have been killed in Russian shelling in the eastern Donetsk oblast. At least three Ukrainian civilians were killed and 13 were wounded in artillery barrages from the Russian military in Donetsk, Ukrainian officials said on Monday. Ukraine says it has struck a base used by the Wagner group, according to reports. Ukraine said it had struck a base used by Russian paramilitary group as well as a bridge near the occupied city of Melitopol , according to reports from AFP. Five people have been injured in Kharkiv after Russian shelling. Two of them are in a serious condition, a top Ukrainian official has said. Putin says Russia is ready to offer allies in Latin America, Asia and Africa “advanced” weapons. Putin used a speech at an arms show near Moscow to boast of Russia’s advanced weapons capabilities and declare its willingness to share technology with like-minded countries. In a letter to Kim Jong-un for Korea’s liberation day, Putin said closer ties would be in both countries’ interests, and would help strengthen the security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the north-east Asian region, North Korea’s KCNA news agency said. The UN has said it can facilitate an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visit to Ukraine’s damaged Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant if Russia and Ukraine agree. A total of 42 countries have called on Russia to immediately withdraw military forces from the plant, including the US, Japan and the UK, plus the EU. The IAEA has warned of a possible nuclear disaster unless fighting stops. On Poland’s Armed Forces Day, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has released a video statement commemorating the national holiday. In the video, he says in Polish: “Today, just like 102 years ago, we once again face a centuries-old enemy together.” The holiday celebrates the anniversary of the 1920 victory over Soviet Russia at the Battle of Warsaw. Kyiv’s mayor has warned of a cold winter for citizens, due to gas shortages. The former boxing champion and mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said he did not want to reassure residents that “everything will be fine” and that there were “harsh realities” in the country. The defence team of the US basketball star Brittney Griner has appealed against her conviction for drugs possession and trafficking, Griner’s lawyer Maria Blagovolina told Reuters on Monday. Griner, who had played for a Russian club, was arrested at a Moscow airport on 17 February after cannabis-infused vape cartridges were found in her luggage. She pleaded guilty to the charges but said she had made an “honest mistake” by entering Russia with cannabis oil, which is illegal in the country. She was convicted on 4 August and jailed for nine years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T17:18:46Z","webTitle":"‘Rampant profiteering’: Unite asks Ofgem to cap power distributors’ profits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","fields":{"headline":"‘Rampant profiteering’: Unite asks Ofgem to cap power distributors’ profits","bodyText":"The companies responsible for bringing electricity to UK homes have been accused of “rampant profiteering” by a leading union that is calling for the energy regulator to cap their earnings. Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, has written to Ofgem to ask it to clamp down on “excessive” profits generated by regional electricity distribution network operators (DNOs), which raked in £15.8bn in profits last year and have paid out £3.6bn in dividends between 2017 and 2021. In the letter to Ofgem, which has been seen by the Guardian, Graham said the six operators have “been holding the public to ransom for too much and for too long” and called for a recent consultation on the amount they could charge energy suppliers, and ultimately consumers, to be reopened. Graham wants Ofgem, which has been condemned for its handling of the energy crisis, to revise its policies to tighten the controls on DNOs. “It is time to set a clear cap on profits to help give consumers confidence that their energy bills are fair and not simply a vehicle for profiteering energy network owners,” she said. Research by Common Wealth, a thinktank, shows that DNOs have higher profit margins than any other sector in the UK, and expects operators to register profit margins of more than 50% in 2022. The thinktank argues that consumers are paying for privatised monopolies to reward their investors. The government has curbed profits on North Sea oil and gas producers and introduced a levy on “excess returns” made by electricity generators including windfarms and nuclear power plants. However, the profits of DNOs – which carry the energy but do not sell it – have not been on the political agenda. Their earnings have not been inflated by high wholesale gas prices, but charges to consumers through network costs have been rising. Ofgem sets price controls on the monopolies’ revenues for five-year periods to ensure that companies run efficient networks and are incentivised to invest in improving them. In 2019, the regulator conceded that the cost to consumers of transmission were “higher than they needed to be” and that profit margins were “towards the higher end of our expectations”. Average households paid £214.35 for gas and electricity distribution in 2021, it said. The current network price controls period ends this April, with the next five-year period beginning after that. Ofgem is due to make its final determinations on the pricing on 30 November after a consultation with the industry, which began before the energy crisis. In her letter to Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, Graham asked for the regulator to reopen the consultation. As part of her call for an earnings cap, she cited the profits of UK Power Networks (UKPN), which distributes power to 8.3m homes and businesses across London, the east and south-east of England. Common Wealth analysis shows the company has made £2.4bn in profits over the past four years. The UK’s largest electricity distributor, which is owned by CK Hutchison, the Hong Kong-based holding company that also owns the port of Felixstowe, has paid out £1bn in dividends to shareholders over the same period. CK bought UKPN for £5.5bn in 2010 and a £15bn sale of the DNO to a consortium collapsed in the summer amid concerns over the price. In the past four years, Northern Powergrid, which has 3.9 million customers in north-east England and Yorkshire, made £1bn in profit, and Electricity North West made £323m, handing out £212m to shareholders. Northern Powergrid did not pay a dividend during the period, but did in 2015 (£100m) and in 2017 (£50m). In her letter, Graham said: “Ofgem is a regulator that doesn’t regulate. Time for that to change. How long must the public pay for profiteering from the likes of UK Power Networks? It’s time to pull the plug on the energy profiteers.” A spokesperson for UKPN said its cost to the customer was £98 on average, “one of the lowest of any UK electricity distributor and falling as a percentage of the overall electricity bill by a proposed 15% in real terms over the period 2023-28”. The company has invested £6.4bn over 11 years in networks, it said. Ofgem said: “We do not believe that it would be in consumers’ interests to delay the implementation of the price control.” A spokesperson for Energy Networks Association, which represents energy network operators, claimed that Unite’s figures were “misleading” and that investment returns were an accurate reflection of profitability. “The network companies are allowed, by Ofgem, to earn around 5% on their investments and the figures being suggested do not reflect the costs associated with these essential investments,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/mar/16/the-tiktok-wars-why-the-us-and-china-are-feuding-over-the-app","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-17T00:19:47Z","webTitle":"The TikTok wars – why the US and China are feuding over the app","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/16/the-tiktok-wars-why-the-us-and-china-are-feuding-over-the-app","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/mar/16/the-tiktok-wars-why-the-us-and-china-are-feuding-over-the-app","fields":{"headline":"The TikTok wars – why the US and China are feuding over the app","bodyText":"TikTok is once again fending off claims that its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, would share user data from its popular video-sharing app with the Chinese government, or push propaganda and misinformation on its behalf. China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday accused the US itself of spreading disinformation about TikTok’s potential security risks following a report in the Wall Street Journal that the committee on foreign investment in the US – part of the treasury department – was threatening a US ban on the app unless its Chinese owners divest their stake. So are the data security risks real? And should users be worried that the TikTok app will be wiped off their phones? Here’s what to know: What are the concerns about TikTok? Both the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share TikTok user data – such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers – with China’s authoritarian government. A law implemented by China in 2017 requires companies to give the government any personal data relevant to the country’s national security. There’s no evidence that TikTok has turned over such data, but fears abound due to the vast amount of user data it, like other social media companies, collects. Concerns around TikTok were heightened in December when ByteDance said it fired four employees who accessed data on two journalists from BuzzFeed News and the Financial Times while attempting to track down the source of a leaked report about the company. Just last week, the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, told the Senate intelligence committee that TikTok “screams” of national security concerns and that China could also manipulate the algorithm to spread misinformation. “This is a tool that is ultimately within the control of the Chinese government, and to me, it screams out with national security concerns,” Wray said. How is the US responding? The White House national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, declined to comment when asked on Thursday to address the Chinese foreign ministry’s comments about TikTok, citing the review being conducted by the committee on foreign investment. Kirby also could not confirm that the administration sent TikTok a letter warning that the US government may ban the application if its Chinese owners don’t sell its stake but added, “we have legitimate national security concerns with respect to data integrity that we need to observe.” In 2020, then president Donald Trump and his administration sought to force ByteDance to sell off its US assets and ban TikTok from app stores. Courts blocked the effort, and President Joe Biden rescinded Trump’s orders but directed an in-depth study of the issue. A planned sale of TikTok’s US assets was also shelved as the Biden administration negotiated a deal with the app that would address some of the national security concerns. In Congress, US senators Richard Blumenthal and Jerry Moran, a Democrat and a Republican, respectively, wrote a letter in February to the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, urging the committee on foreign investment panel, which she chairs, to “swiftly conclude its investigation and impose strict structural restrictions” between TikTok’s US operations and ByteDance, including potentially separating the companies. At the same time, lawmakers have introduced measures that would expand the Biden administration’s authority to enact a national ban on TikTok. The White House has already backed a Senate proposal that has bipartisan support. How has TikTok already been restricted? On Thursday, British authorities said they were banning TikTok on government-issued phones on security grounds, after similar moves by the EU’s executive branch, which temporarily banned TikTok from employee phones. Denmark and Canada have also announced efforts to block the app on government-issued phones. Last month, the White House said it would give US federal agencies 30 days to delete TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. Congress, the US armed forces and more than half of US states had already banned the app on official devices. What does TikTok say? A TikTok spokesperson, Maureen Shanahan, said the company was already answering security concerns through “transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification”. In June, TikTok said it would route all data from US users to servers controlled by Oracle, the Silicon Valley company it chose as its US tech partner in 2020 in an effort to avoid a nationwide ban. But it is storing backups of the data in its own servers in the US and Singapore. The company said it expects to delete US user data from its own servers, but it has not provided a timeline as to when that would occur. The TikTok CEO, Shou Zi Chew, is will testify next week before the House energy and commerce committee about the company’s privacy and data-security practices, as well as its relationship with the Chinese government. In the lead-up to the hearing, Chew has quietly met with several lawmakers – some of whom remain unmoved by their conversation with the 40-year-old executive. After convening with Chew in February, Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado who previously called on Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, said he remained “fundamentally concerned that TikTok, as a Chinese-owned company, is subject to dictates from the Chinese Communist party”. Meanwhile, TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, has been trying to position itself as more of an international company – and less of a Chinese company that was founded in Beijing in 2012 by its current chief executive, Liang Rubo, and others. Theo Bertram, TikTok’s vice-president of policy in Europe, said in a tweet on Thursday that ByteDance “is not a Chinese company”. Bertram said its ownership consists of 60% global investors, 20% employees and 20% founders. Its leaders are based in cities such as Singapore, New York, Beijing and other metropolitan areas. Are the security risks legitimate? It depends on whom you ask. Some tech privacy advocates say that while the potential abuse of privacy by the Chinese government is concerning, other tech companies have data-harvesting business practices that also exploit user information. “If policymakers want to protect Americans from surveillance, they should advocate for a basic privacy law that bans all companies from collecting so much sensitive data about us in the first place, rather than engaging in what amounts to xenophobic showboating that does exactly nothing to protect anyone,” said Evan Greer, director of the non-profit advocacy group Fight for the Future. Karim Farhat, a researcher with the Internet Governance Project at Georgia Tech, said a TikTok sale would be “completely irrelevant to any of the alleged ‘national security’ threats” and go against “every free market principle and norm” of the state department’s internet freedom principles. Others say there is legitimate reason for concern. People who use TikTok might think they’re not doing anything that would be of interest to a foreign government, but that’s not always the case, said Anton Dahbura, executive director of the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. Important information about the US is not strictly limited to nuclear power plants or military facilities; it extends to other sectors, such as food processing, the finance industry and universities, Dahbura said. Is there precedent for banning tech companies? Last year, the US banned the sale of communications equipment made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, citing risks to national security. But banning the sale of items could be more easily done than banning an app, which is accessed through the web. Such a move might also go to the courts on grounds that it could violate the first amendment as some civil liberties groups have argued."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/15/explosion-in-poland-unlikely-to-spark-escalation-even-if-caused-by-russian-missiles","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-15T23:52:09Z","webTitle":"Poland explosion unlikely to spark escalation – but risks of Nato-Russia clash are real","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/15/explosion-in-poland-unlikely-to-spark-escalation-even-if-caused-by-russian-missiles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/15/explosion-in-poland-unlikely-to-spark-escalation-even-if-caused-by-russian-missiles","fields":{"headline":"Poland explosion unlikely to spark escalation – but risks of Nato-Russia clash are real","bodyText":"If it was a Russian missile that struck a Polish village on Tuesday, killing two people, it would be the first time a Russian weapon has ever come down on Nato territory. The Soviet Union and the US managed to get through the whole cold war without making such a mistake, because Washington and Moscow were well aware of the risks of going to war by accident or miscalculation. Vladimir Putin’s Russia is a far less predictable nuclear power than the Soviet Union, raising the danger level, as Joe Biden has pointed out, to the highest since the Cuban missile crisis. Putin’s intervention in Syria led to a Russian warplane being shot down by a Turkish fighter jet over the Turkish-Syrian border in November 2015, but that incident was contained. Similarly, Tuesday’s missile incident is unlikely to lead to a direct Nato-Russian confrontation. The Polish government has said it is still investigating whose missiles fell on its territory, and the office of President Andrzej Duda has said it is considering invoking article 4 of Nato’s founding treaty, which allows any member to call for urgent consultations of the North Atlantic council “whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened”. Duda spoke to Biden; the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg; and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Tuesday night. Warsaw did not mention article 5 of the treaty, which states that an armed attack on one member is an attack on all, and which would be the most likely mechanism of escalation to a war between Nato and Russia. Article 5 cannot be invoked by just one member state, the former US ambassador to Nato, Ivo Daalder, said, adding it “requires Nato consensus”. The only time it was invoked by the Nato allies was in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and led to the allies providing aerial radar patrols over the US and stepping up naval patrols in the Mediterranean. Even if it was concluded that the missiles that crossed the Polish border were indeed Russian, and not Ukrainian anti-missile interceptors, it would fall short of an “armed attack” envisaged in article 5, argued William Alberque, director of strategy, technology and arms control for International Institute for Strategic Studies. “‘Deliberate armed attack’ is a real thing,” Alberque said. “Two misfired cruise or ballistic missiles ain’t it.” Up to now, the broad Nato consensus has been that Russian escalation would lead to stepped-up arms supplies to Ukraine, and that – rather than any form of direct Nato involvement – would serve as a deterrent to Russian recklessness. That is the most likely response this time, and there will be a debate within Nato on whether it warrants a step up in the sort of military assistance being provided. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, argued it warranted the provision of F-15 and F-16 fighter jets. The Polish border incident has also restored calls for a no-fly zone over western Ukraine enforced by Nato air defences, in particular from Baltic state officials. Advocates of such a move argued that the risks of such a step triggering an all-out war are far lower now than at the start of the full-scale invasion, as Russian forces are currently confined to the far east and south of the country. However, there would be considerable resistance to any such expansion of Nato’s role from the US and other Nato allies. Even though this incident is likely to be contained, it does not mean that risks of a Nato-Russian clash through miscalculation are not real. Kyiv is anxious to bind Nato as closely as possible to the country’s struggle to restore its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that the missiles were a “a strike against our collective security” and a “very serious escalation”. Meanwhile, as the Russian military debacle in Ukraine worsens with the loss of Kherson and surrounding territory, Putin is becoming more desperate and the ultra-hawks who dominate television discourse in Russia are baying for a confrontation to rationalise the humiliation of losing a war to Ukraine. While the defence ministry claimed not to have anything to do with the missiles, Margarita Simonyan, the head of the RT propaganda channel, gloated over the implications of a Russian strike. “If this isn’t a deliberate provocation, there’s one piece of good news here,” Simonyan said on Twitter. “A Nato country is so shitily defended that anyone can accidentally hit it with anything and all of Nato won’t even know who hit it, with what and why.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2021/jun/02/tonights-tv-britains-first-nuclear-reactor-in-20-years","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-02T05:00:33Z","webTitle":"Tonight’s TV: Britain’s first nuclear reactor in 20 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jun/02/tonights-tv-britains-first-nuclear-reactor-in-20-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jun/02/tonights-tv-britains-first-nuclear-reactor-in-20-years","fields":{"headline":"Tonight’s TV: Britain’s first nuclear reactor in 20 years","bodyText":"Building Britain’s Biggest Nuclear Power Station 9pm, BBC Two With an estimated construction cost of between £21.5bn and £22.5bn, the nuclear power plant in question – Hinkley Point C – was one of eight announced by the government in 2010, but the only one on which work has since commenced, meaning it will become the first nuclear power station to have been built in the UK in more than 20 years.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, declared the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam an “environmental bomb of mass destruction” and said only liberating the entire country could guarantee against new “terrorist” acts. He blamed Russian occupying forces, which have had control of the dam and the adjacent town since last year’s full-scale invasion. “It is physically impossible to blow it up somehow from the outside, by shelling. It was mined by the Russian occupiers. And they blew it up,” Zelenskiy tweeted. “This is the largest man-made environmental disaster in Europe in decades.” Satellite images of the dam in the days leading up to the collapse showed it was in a worsening state. A picture from Monday this week showed part of the roadway along the top missing and apparent damage to at least one sluice gate below. CNN reported that analysis of other, lower-resolution imagery suggested the damage had occurred between 1 and 2 June. On Tuesday, damage turned to catastrophic failure. Aerial footage showed the dam missing a broad mid-section with the reservoir behind, which had been at record levels, pouring over it and roaring downstream. Towns along its path were inundated, complete houses could be seen floating away in the waters, while pets and wild animals scrambled to survive. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. He said people were being evacuated and would be taken by bus to Kherson city and then by train to Mykolaiv and other Ukrainian cities, including Khmelnytskyi, Odesa, Kropyvnytskyi and Kyiv. In Kherson city, the water level rose over 3 metres over the course of Tuesday, and by mid afternoon was still rising by 6cm to 8cm every half hour in low-lying areas, according to hydrologist Larysa Musian, who was taking depth measurements on a Kherson street corner. Relief workers on the right bank of the river had to work under fire. “The biggest difficulty right now is not the water. It’s the Russians on the other side of the river who are shelling us now with artillery,” said Andrew Negrych, who was coordinating relief efforts for a US charity, Global Empowerment Mission. In Nova Kakhovka, all the animals except ducks and geese drowned, according to the animal welfare organisation Uanimals. “We tried hard to preserve the zoo during the occupation and now it no longer exists,” the group quoted the zoo management as saying. The disaster will have damaging effects that could last for generations, from the immediate potential for loss of life to the thousands of people forced to abandon their homes and farms. It is expected to have a catastrophic effect on the ecology of the region and will sweep mines from the banks of the Dnipro into villages and farmland downstream. It also robs Ukraine of long-term capacity for generating hydroelectric power. The loss of the upstream reservoir threatens water supplies to the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions and Crimea, and has long-term implications for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant 120 miles (200km) upstream. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, said the hydroelectric plant and dam had been blown up at 2.50am local time (0050 BST) on Tuesday. “Both constructions are located in the temporary Russian-occupied territories,” Yermak told the Guardian. “Neither shelling nor any other external influence was capable of destroying the structures. The explosion came from within.” The Ukrainian hydroelectric power corporation said the dam had been destroyed by a bomb placed in one of the turbine halls on top of it. The dam collapse happened on the second day of Ukrainian offensive operations likely to mark the early stages of a mass counteroffensive. It could affect any Ukrainian plans for an amphibious assault across the river. “The purpose is obvious: to create insurmountable obstacles on the way of the advancing [Ukrainian army] … to slow down the fair final of the war,” the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter. Rishi Sunak said if Russia was responsible for the destruction of the dam in Ukraine, it would be a “new low” for Moscow in the invasion. Speaking to reporters on board his official plane to Washington last night, the UK prime minister said: “If it is intentional it would represent the largest attack on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the war.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he had no independent information about the circumstances of the collapse but added: “One thing is clear: this is another devastating consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.” Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, and Janez Lenarčič, European commissioner for crisis management, issued a joint statement warning the attack could be a war crime. “It represents a new dimension of Russian atrocities and may constitute a violation of international law, notably international humanitarian law,” they said. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said at a televised town hall meeting: “By all accounts, this is aggression by the Russian side to stop the Ukrainian offensive, to defend its own country. This shows that this is a new dimension.” Local Russian authorities in the city of Nova Kakhovka initially denied anything had happened to the dam, then blamed the collapse on Ukrainian shelling. The Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed official from the Kherson emergency services as saying the dam had collapsed from structural weakness under water pressure. Zelenskiy called an emergency meeting of his national security council on Tuesday. “Russian terrorists,” Zelenskiy said on Twitter. “The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam only confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land. “Not a single metre should be left to them, because they use every metre for terror. It’s only Ukraine’s victory that will return security. And this victory will come. The terrorists will not be able to stop Ukraine with water, missiles or anything else.” Prokudin posted a video to Telegram in which he said that as a result of the damage to the dam, “water will reach a critical level in five hours” and that evacuations had begun. Russia’s state-run news agency Tass cited emergency services saying 80 settlements could be affected. A Russian military blogger, Rybar, said 11 out of 28 spans in the dam were destroyed after explosions at 2am, though this could not immediately be verified. Another blogger said there were no reported missile attacks on the dam before the breach, while videos circulated on Russian channels were said to be of civilians evacuating. Vladimir Leontiev, the head of the Russian-occupied administration of Nova Kakhovka city, on the southern bank of the Dnipro, initially denied the dam had been blown up, according to the Ria Novosti news agency, but he was later reported to confirm there was “damage” and blamed it on shelling. Interfax quoted an unnamed representative from regional emergency services as saying the collapse was the result of a catastrophic structural failure. “The dam could not stand it: one support collapsed, and flooding began,” the representative said, adding that there were no attacks on the hydroelectric power station overnight. Last month, it was reported that water levels in the reservoir had reached a 30-year high as the Russian occupiers had kept relatively few sluice gates open, according to experts. David Helms, a former US air force and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist who has monitored the dam, said on Twitter: “The Russians allowed the reservoir to fill to record levels; if the dam failed ‘naturally’, it certainly failed due to six weeks of over-topping and stress on the structure.” The areas most under threat from flooding are the islands along the course of the Dnipro downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Earlier modelling of such a disaster suggested Kherson city would not bear the brunt, but the harbour, the docklands and an island in the south of the city are likely to be inundated. It is unclear how many people could lose their homes. There could be two further serious side-effects: the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant upstream could lose access to water for cooling as the reservoir drains away, and the water supply to Crimea could also be severely affected. Four of the six reactors at the nuclear plant are completely shut down, and two are on “hot shutdown”, producing a small amount of energy for the plant itself and the neighbouring town. The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a tweet its experts at the plant were monitoring the situation. It said there was “no immediate nuclear safety risk at plant”. A Moscow-backed official in the Zaporizhzhia region was quoted by a Russian news agency as saying there was no “critical danger” to the plant yet. The dam, a Soviet power project, was completed in 1956 and was 30 metres high, holding back a vast reservoir of 18 cubic kilometres of water. It sits about 20 miles (32km) upstream from Ukrainian-held Kherson. Zelenskiy warned last November that Russia was plotting to blow up the two-mile structure and that doing so would cause “a large-scale disaster” affecting people living downstream."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-283-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-03T14:34:43Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 283 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-283-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-283-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 283 of the invasion","bodyText":"Eighteen Ukrainian diplomatic missions in 12 countries have received bloody packages, including animal parts, in what Ukraine has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Oleh Nikolenko, a spokesperson from Ukraine’s foreign ministry, said the packages were simultaneously sent from one European country, which he could not disclose while the investigation was ongoing. Ukrainian authorities in Kherson have urged people on the east of the Dnipro River to evacuate. Governor Yaroslav Yanushevych said that authorities would help people to evacuate during the daytime of Saturday to Monday, according to the Kyiv Independent. More than 7,000 explosives have been removed from around Kherson, the Ukrainian state emergency service has said. Russian forces are concentrating most of their strength on taking the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk, according to the British Ministry of Defence. The price cap on Russian seabourne oil has been expanded to the G7 and Australia, after it was agreed by EU countries. Poland had held out on a lower amount than the $60 per barrel that was agreed. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would “not accept this ceiling”. Another 510 Russian troops were killed on Friday according to Ukraine, bringing the total killed since the invasion in February to 90,600. A tank and eight drones were also lost by the Russians. Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine’s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine’s general staff. One person was killed and six were injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine on Friday. Zelenskiy aide Kyrylo Tymoshenko said one civilian was killed and four injured in the Donetsk region, one was injured in Kharkiv and another in Kherson. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnipro River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. The Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help Europe is not resilient enough. The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times, Reuters reported. Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative.

Germany is aiming to deliver seven Gepard tanks that had been destined for the scrap pile to Ukraine this spring, adding to 30 of the air-defence tanks that are already being used to fight against the Russian army, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday. Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation PEN. The United States is reportedly working with two Middle Eastern countries to shift advanced Nasams air defence systems to Ukraine in the next three to six months. Kyiv received two of the eight approved deliveries of Nasams in early November. Russia tested a new missile defence system rocket, its defence ministry said. The missile was launched from the Sary Shagan testing range in Kazakhstan. Other than saying the test was successful, the ministry gave few other details. The chief economic adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on BP to exit Russia entirely after the fossil fuel firm was offered a £580m dividend by the oil giant Rosneft.

Frans Timmermans, the second most senior official in the EU, said the threat of unrest this winter, a deliberate outcome of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, must take precedence over the climate crisis. He said: “If our society descends into very, very strong conflict and strife because there is no energy, we’re certainly not going to make our [climate] goals. We’re certainly not going to get where we need to get if the lack of energy leads to strong disruption in our societies, and we need to make sure people are not in the cold in the coming winter. “We need to make sure we keep our industry, as much as possible, functioning because the one thing that could help Putin is divisions in our society.” People suffering from the cold this winter because they cannot afford heating would also be disastrous for solving the climate crisis, Timmermans argued in an interview with the Guardian in Brussels. “I’ve been in politics long enough, over 30 years, to understand that people worry most about the immediate crisis and not about the long-term crisis And if we don’t address the immediate crisis, we will certainly be off-track with the long-term crisis,” he said. Timmermans said his goal was to reassure the public of the EU, by 1 November at the latest, that they would not face a crisis in heating their homes this winter. “I honestly believe that if we can’t give that guarantee then society is on edge, as it is everywhere because of high energy prices, inflation, food prices rising rapidly – because of this uncertainty caused by the war,” he said. “Putin is using all the means he has to create strife in our societies, so we have to brace ourselves for a very difficult period.” Coal would have to be used, he said. “If we were just to say no more coal right now, we wouldn’t be very convincing in some of our member states and we would contribute to tensions within our society getting even higher.” Energy prices have soared across the world as a result of the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine, but Europe has been particularly badly hit. Before Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Germany – the EU’s biggest economy – relied on Russia for the majority of its gas. Overall, Europe depends on Russia for about 40% of its gas. The German government has started to increase electricity production from coal-fired power stations, the dirtiest form of energy, while allowing the phaseout of nuclear power to continue as planned. Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, also insisted that the G7 reverse its stance on banning overseas investment in gas projects to assist in the exploration of new fossil fuel fields in developing countries. The European parliament also voted this week to class some gas and nuclear power projects as “clean” energy for investment purposes, to the dismay of climate campaigners who worry the climate agenda has been lost amid fears over energy prices. Timmermans, who is in charge of the EU’s green deal and leads the bloc in international climate negotiations, insisted that a short-term return to fossil fuels was compatible with limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the goal affirmed at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last November. He also gave qualified support for the expansion of fossil fuel exploration in parts of Africa that civil society leaders have already warned would lock Africa into a high-emissions future without benefiting ordinary people. “In this global situation right now, with the huge shortage of fossil fuel, how can you say to anyone who has fossil fuels: ‘You should not be exploiting that.’” he asked. “How can we not face the immediate challenge of having to find alternatives for Russian gas, and saying to others: ‘You should not be exploiting gas.’ That would be hypocritical. I can’t say that.” But Timmermans dampened expectations for Cop27, the next global climate summit taking place this November in Sharm el-Sheikh. At Cop26, countries failed to produce national plans on cutting emissions in line with the 1.5C limit they affirmed, and so agreed to return to the negotiating table this year with tougher plans called nationally determined contributions (NDCs). These were unlikely to be forthcoming as promised, however, given the energy and food crises and the war in Ukraine, Timmermans said. “I don’t see that many new NDCs on the horizon, frankly,” he said, pointing to Australia, with its new government, as a rare exception. “I don’t have the highest expectations for this by Sharm el-Sheikh because the conference in Bonn that was just finished clearly showed that there’s not much appetite in increasing NDCs, and there is a lot of frustration in the developing world about the money that was promised and is not yet fully on the table.” Timmermans blamed Putin for this failure. “Everything hinges on the energy transition and energy is at the heart of this. “If one of the major energy producers in the world is causing this disruption, as Russia is doing right now, obviously the rest of the world will be edgy in terms of what happens in the energy markets, and obviously that has an implication of can we make further commitments on reducing our emissions given the situation?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/24/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-304-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-24T02:29:38Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 304 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/24/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-304-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/24/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-304-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 304 of the invasion","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has ordered Russia’s defence industry chiefs ensure its army gets all the weapons, equipment and military hardware it needs “in the shortest possible timeframes” to fight in Ukraine. The Russian president also called for their proposals on “addressing the problems that are inevitable” and how to “make sure there are fewer of them”. Putin’s comments in the city of Tula, a centre for Russian arms manufacturing, came just days after he pledged to give his army anything it asked for in a meeting with Russia’s top military officials. The United States has called on Vladimir Putin to acknowledge reality and withdraw troops from Ukraine after he used the word “war” to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Putin on Thursday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since the February invasion, previously calling his campaign a “special military operation”. A state department spokesperson said: “Finally, after 300 days, Putin called the war what it is.” A Russian opposition politician, Nikita Yuferev, has filed a legal challenge over Putin’s use of the word “war”. Russian forces have been demolishing a theatre in occupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine that was the site of a deadly airstrike believed to have killed hundreds of civilians, according to an aide to the city’s exiled Ukrainian mayor. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said the move was an “attempt to hide forever the evidence of the deliberate killing of Ukrainians by Russians”. Video posted on Ukrainian and Russian websites on Friday showed heavy equipment taking down much of the building. An Amnesty International investigation concluded Russian forces committed a war crime by deliberately targeting the building. Iran is seeking to expand the supply of advanced weapons to Russia, the head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency has said, according to local media. The warning from David Barnea comes after the US this month expressed alarm over a “full-scale defence partnership” between Tehran and Moscow. Russian forces shelled the recently liberated Kherson region 61 times on Thursday, killing one person and injuring two, said the head of the eastern Ukrainian region’s military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych. About half the strikes hit Kherson city, striking residential blocks, educational institutions and private houses, he said, while a kindergarten was also affected. Two civilians were killed in shelling of the city on Friday morning, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. Two people were injured after a car bomb exploded in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in south-eastern Ukraine, according to a local pro-Moscow official. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia province, described the incident as a “terrorist attack” carried out by “militants of the Kyiv regime” to Russian state media. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, wrote on Telegram that witnesses reported a car was “blown up”. Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, has described the discovery of a German intelligence official suspected of working for Russia as “alarming”, amid fears the offical had access to sensitive information from western allies. The man, an employee of the BND foreign intelligence agency identified as Carsten L, was arrested on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing state secrets to Russia, German prosecutors said. Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, warned the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high” and compared US-Russia relations to an “ice age” in comments reported by Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency. The Kremlin accused the US of fighting a proxy war against Russia. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted a video saying he is back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office – we are working toward victory,” he said in the video, posted to his Telegram channel on Friday. Zelenskiy’s visit to the White House confirmed that Ukraine and the US are “strategic partners” for the first time in history, the Ukrainian leader’s most senior adviser has said. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainan president’s office, told the Guardian the trip had cemented Zelenskiy’s bond with the US president, Joe Biden, and senior US Republicans. The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had “almost stopped”. Speaking on Russian state television, governor Yevgeny Balitsky said on Friday that Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant – Europe’s largest – and it would never return to Ukrainian control. Ukraine estimates its grain harvest fell by about 40% year-on-year due to the Russian invasion, a representative for the country’s industry said. “We expect a grain harvest of 65-66 million tonnes” by the end of the year, the head of the Ukrainian Grain Association, Sergiy Ivashchenko, said on Friday, after a record harvest of 106m tonnes last year. “The main reason is the war,” which immediately led to fuel shortages and hindered sowing, he said. Ukraine plans to open new embassies in 10 African countries, Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced, with the aim of increasing Kyiv’s presence in Africa and strengthening trade ties. There were also plans to develop a “Ukraine-Africa trade house” with offices in the capitals of “the most promising countries” on the African continent, he added.

Sure, but the devil is in the complex detail","bodyText":"“It’s like entering a lottery: you know something’s coming your way, but you’ve got no idea exactly what,” says one chief executive of a large UK electricity generator about the looming windfall tax on his sector. It’s a fair comment. Government thinking on the generators – as opposed to the North Sea oil and gas producers, who already have a levy – has been spinning like a wind turbine for six months. Back in May, then-chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was “urgently evaluating” the scale of excess profits being made by generators on the entirely sensible grounds that not all windfall profits have been made by firms producing dirty hydrocarbons. Nuclear power plants, windfarms, solar farms, hydro projects and biomass burners may also be doing very nicely thanks to a UK energy system that ties the price of electricity to the price of gas. But Sunak conceded defeat in the face of complexity. Power is contractually sold forward; hedges complicate matters; the windfall component is hard to isolate. But never mind, Kwasi Kwarteng, then business secretary, was soon looking at a voluntary negotiation with generators to lower the price of energy. Those on old-style (and often lucrative) “renewables obligations” incentives would be switched to newer “contracts-for-difference” where windfall returns don’t arise because revenues over a set price flow to the Treasury. With Kwarteng as chancellor, and Liz Truss as PM, the plan seemed to be set. Soon, though, it morphed into a revenue cap – modelled on the European Union’s version – because negotiations with companies stalled. Then we arrived at the Sunak-Jeremy Hunt combo in Downing Street, and it seems we’re back to something closer to Sunak’s original thought: a conventional windfall tax. That, at least, is the prediction for Thursday’s autumn statement. Alongside an increase in the levy on North Sea firms, the chancellor is expected to introduce a charge of 40%-45% on generators’ “excess returns”. All clear now? Well, it depends on whether “excess” has been defined. Is the EU’s threshold of €180 a megawatt hour for its revenue cap the right level to use in the UK to judge a fair return? Probably not: the EU seemed to be guided by the marginal cost of coal generation, which has been virtually phased out in the UK. And – to pick on one fraught debate – are gas-fired power stations a suitable target for a windfall charge? Attention has mostly focused on nuclear and renewables generators on old-style “renewables obligations” certificates, but the gas-fired crew have also been having a nice crisis, as SSE half-year numbers on Wednesday demonstrated. Should gas-fired stations get softer treatment because their crucial “flexible” capacity has been maintained during rotten years for profits? That was the gist on the argument from SSE’s chief executive, Alistair Phillips-Davies. But one could equally argue it would be perverse to tax renewables (SSE’s prime investment focus) while leaving gas untouched if the government is also trying to accelerate a green transition. Therein lie a few complexities in designing a windfall tax on generators. It ain’t straightforward. The point, though, is that it’s time to make choices – and not boot the detail into another round of consultation, negotiation and lobbying. Delay and uncertainty also impact companies’ investment decisions and the government has been round the houses with the generators for half a year. Hunt must arrive with a plan, as opposed to an intention. Property investors racked with gilts If investors in gilts have been surprised by how much volatility can be generated by rising interest rates and a reckless mini-budget, think of poor investors in property investment trusts. The share prices of the FTSE 100 duo, LandSec and British Land, have been yo-yoing like dotcom startups. The former’s share price was 730p at the end of August, went as low as 480p in September and is now 611p. British Land has swung around in similar fashion. The explanation is those same gilt prices. When yields on government IOUs rise, investors demand a greater return to own a riskier asset such as property. So property values fall. Even so, there’s a glaring mismatch between the declines in property values expected by the industry (10%-15%, generally speaking) and the 40%-ish discounts to published asset values at which the shares of LandSec and British Land currently trade. The stock market’s gloom on commercial property has been justified on many occasions in the past. There’s just a chance, though, that it might be overdoing it this time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/may/30/atoms-and-ashes-by-serhii-plokhy-review-why-another-nuclear-disaster-is-almost-inevitable","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-30T08:00:23Z","webTitle":"Atoms and Ashes by Serhii Plokhy review – why another nuclear disaster is almost inevitable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/30/atoms-and-ashes-by-serhii-plokhy-review-why-another-nuclear-disaster-is-almost-inevitable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/may/30/atoms-and-ashes-by-serhii-plokhy-review-why-another-nuclear-disaster-is-almost-inevitable","fields":{"headline":"Atoms and Ashes by Serhii Plokhy review – why another nuclear disaster is almost inevitable","bodyText":"Once hailed as a source of electricity that would be too cheap to meter, atomic power has come a long way since the 1950s – mostly downhill. Far from being cost-free, nuclear-generated electricity is today more expensive than power produced by coal, gas, wind or solar plants while sites storing spent uranium and irradiated equipment litter the globe, a deadly radioactive legacy that will endure for hundreds of thousands of years. For good measure, most analysts now accept that the spread of atomic energy played a crucial role in driving nuclear weapon proliferation. Then there are the disasters. Some of the world’s worst accidents have had nuclear origins and half a dozen especially egregious examples have been selected by Harvard historian Serhii Plokhy to support his thesis that atomic power is never going to be the energy saviour of our imperilled species. His “six of the worst” includes the explosions that wrecked power stations at Chernobyl in 1986, Three Mile Island in 1979 and Fukushima in 2011, as well as the fire at the Windscale reactor in 1957; the Bikini Atoll hydrogen bomb test that spread radioactive cloud across the Pacific Ocean in 1954; and the 1957 Kyshtym disaster, which irradiated 20,000 square miles of the Urals after a Soviet plutonium production plant exploded. All were caused – in varying degrees – by poor design, technological mistakes, hubris and operator error. Dozens died trying to limit the effects of these disasters and thousands of citizens were exposed to radiation that will have triggered tumours and premature death. In the case of the Kyshtym accident, a huge tract of irradiated land was declared uninhabitable, and remains that way 65 years after the disaster, while the clean-up bill for Fukushima is now estimated at $187bn (£150bn). National leaders reacted in different ways. President Jimmy Carter was quick to visit Three Mile Island to provide reassurance that the site was no longer a danger to America, contrasting with Mikhail Gorbachev, who waited three years before he popped over to see how things were going at Chernobyl. Some operators reacted with panic as reactors caught fire and alarm blared through their control rooms, though a great many were calm, if baffled, as fresh catastrophes continued to unfold, with the prize for cool-headedness going to Windscale operator Arthur Wilson, who realised the plant’s Number 1 reactor was on fire and ready to explode. “I thought, ‘Oh, dear, now we are in a pickle,’” he recalled. Nor are we likely to have experienced our last nuclear disaster, adds Plokhy in this grim but expertly concise account of what happens when atom plants go bad. The world has about 440 reactors in operation and another Fukushima-like blast at one of these is almost inevitable, probably before the middle of the next decade. Yet politicians keep coming back to the nuclear industry, most recently as a solution to global heating and our current energy crisis. Reactors emit very little carbon dioxide and can provide significant amounts of electricity – once they are up and running. In a world seeking climate stability and freedom from Russian oil and gas, they can look attractive. Hence Boris Johnson’s promise that “nuclear is coming home” and should be supplying 25% of UK’s power by 2050. Plokhy will have none of this. “Nuclear power is too costly and it takes too long to build a reactor and it is inherently unsafe not only for technological reasons but also because of the risk of human error,” he says. And given the past failures and disasters that he highlights, it is hard not to agree with him, though we should note that his arguments carry a careful coda. Nuclear power still generates 10% of the world’s electricity and that is a precious supply. Lose it and fossil fuels would have to fill the gap. So we still need the nukes that we have already got – for the moment at least – but please do not add any more to the list, says Plokhy whose Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy won the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction in 2018. As he puts it, the nuclear industry has gone past its spring and summer years and should be allowed to reach a useful but limited autumn before it is quietly forgotten as a dark global experiment that should not be repeated. • Atoms and Ashes: From Bikini Atoll to Fukushima by Serhii Plokhy is published by Allen Lane (£25).

We will be closing this blog and moving to the new page below. Singapore has outlined details of the financial measures it will impose on Russia, after it announced on Monday that it would take the rare step of imposing sanctions. In a statement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: We will impose financial measures targeted at designated Russian banks, entities and activities in Russia, and fund-raising activities benefiting the Russian government. Digital payment token service providers are specifically prohibited from facilitating transactions that could help to circumvent these financial measures. These measures apply to all financial institutions in Singapore, including banks, finance companies, insurers, capital markets intermediaries, securities exchanges and payment service providers. The statement describes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “a gross violation of international law”. It is the first country in Southeast Asia to impose sanctions. Full details of the measures are on the ministry website. The Washington Post’s media reporter says the paper will no longer include staff names on stories produced by reporters in Russia, to protect their safety. This is in response to a new law imposed in Russia that threatens jail terms of up to 15 years for spreading “fake news” about the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine. The law has prompted several global news organisations to suspend reporting in the country, including the BBC, the Canadian Broadcasting Company and Bloomberg News. CNN and CBS News said they would stop broadcasting in Russia. The port city Mariupol has been “blockaded” by Russian forces, according to its mayor, AFP reports. Mayor Vadym Boychenko has perviously warned the city has no water, heat or electricity and that supplies of food are running out. He has asked for military assistance and for a humanitarian corridor to allow the safe evacuation of some of the city’s 400,000 residents. If Russia were to control the city, this would help it to build a land corridor between Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, and Russian-backed regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. In a message posted to the mayor’s Telegram account, he said: For now, we are looking for solutions to humanitarian problems and all possible ways to get Mariupol out of the blockade... Our priority is the establishment of a ceasefire so that we can restore vital infrastructure and set up a humanitarian corridor to bring food and medicine into the city. Here are images from across Ukraine’s towns and cities, taken on Friday. More than 1.2 million people have fled from Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February. The UN Refugee Agency believes a similar number are displaced but remain within the country’s borders. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN has said that Russian forces are now “20 miles and closing from Ukraine’s second largest nuclear facility”, warning that imminent danger continues. “We narrowly avoided a disaster last night,” she said, referring to Russia’s recent attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, about 140 miles (225 km) west of Mariupol. “The international community must be unanimous in demanding Russia’s forces stop their dangerous assaul,” she said. Samsung has become the latest company to suspend shipments to Russia, Bloomberg reports. In a statement, the company said: “Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted and our priority is to ensure the safety of all our employees and their families.” The company is also donating $6 million, including $1 million in consumer electronics products, to humanitarian efforts in the region, according to Bloomberg. Microsoft has also suspended all sales and services to Russia, while Apple has suspended sales of iPhones, and restricted other services. A Sky News crew has been evacuated back to the UK from Ukraine after journalists were shot during an ambush by a suspected Russian “death squad”. The team of five were attacked while out in a car, after unsuccessfully trying to visit the town of Bucha near Kyiv. Chief correspondent with Sky News, Stuart Ramsay, along with camera operator Richie Mockler were shot – Ramsay in the lower back while Mockler took two rounds in his body armour. Hello, Rebecca Ratcliffe here in Bangkok, taking over from my colleague Dani. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will address the US Senate on Saturday during a Zoom call that is scheduled for 9.30am Eastern Time. The call has been requested by Zelenskiy. Here is AFP’s report As the war in Ukraine intensifies, some US lawmakers are urging President Joe Biden to take a tougher stance against Russia, such as by suspending imports of its oil. The White House has ruled this out so far, fearing it might cause rising oil prices to go up even more and hurt US consumers stung by record inflation. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has called for “somebody in Russia” to assassinate President Vladimir Putin. Zelensky himself is strongly urging NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to halt bombing raids but the Biden administration has ruled this out, fearing it might lead to an all-out war between the West and Russia, although some US lawmakers support the creation of such a zone. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has critisized Nato for refusing to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying the decision has given “the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian towns and villages”. “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity,” the Ukrainian president said in an emotional nighttime address. Nato warned on Friday that imposing a no-fly zone could provoke full-fledged war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia. “The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send Nato fighter planes into Ukraine’s airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,” Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato chief, said. “If we did that, we’ll end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering.” Zelenskiy said Nato countries have created a narrative that a no-fly zone would provoke Russia’s aggression against Nato. “This is the self-hypnosis of those who are weak, insecure inside, despite the fact they possess weapons many times stronger than we have,” he said. He also praised Ukrainians for their resistance against Russia’s invasion: “We are warriors of light,” he said. “The history of Europe will remember this forever.” The war in Ukraine is shaking markets, slowing economic growth and sending European stocks sinking. From Reuters: Data showing a vibrant U.S. jobs market strengthened the dollar and spurred commodity prices higher, but the war in Ukraine overshadowed the blowout report as the euro plunged on the worsening outlook for slower European economic growth. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.8% as job growth surged in February, a bright spot for an economy that faces mounting headwinds from rising inflation, tighter monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and geopolitical tensions. The euro tumbled below $1.10 for the first time in almost two years and hit a fresh seven-year low against the safe-haven Swiss franc as Russian forces seized the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and fighting raged elsewhere in Ukraine. European stocks sank to near one-year lows, with the pan-regional STOXX 600 index sliding 3.56% to increase losses for the week to 7% - its worst weekly decline since the depths of a pandemic-fueled sell-off in March 2020. The Metropolitan police’s war crimes team is assisting in the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation of alleged war crimes in Ukraine. The Met is tasked with carrying out “any UK enquiries into war crimes and core international crimes”, it said Friday, and is “appealing for anyone in the UK who may have direct evidence of war crimes”. “Officers are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may themselves have witnessed or been the victim of any war crimes in Ukraine at any time from 21 November 2013 onwards,” the Met said. Investigators are seeking out people who have a direct link to relevant information, rather than the general public submitting social media posts or media reports. “This could be in the form of direct messages, images or videos that friends or relatives here in the UK have been sent by those in Ukraine. Or it could be somebody who was previously in Ukraine and who may have witnessed or even been a victim of a war crime and has since travelled to the UK,” said Richard Smith, the head of the Met’s counter terrorism command. Several leading luxury brands, including Hermes, the Cartier owner Richemont, LVMH, Kering and Chanel, announced they will temporarily close stores and halt business operations in Russia. “Given our increasing concerns about the current situation, the growing uncertainty and the complexity to operate, Chanel decided to temporarily pause its business in Russia,” the French luxury fashion house said in a post on LinkedIn. More from Reuters: Luxury giant LVMH, which owns such brands as Christian Dior, Givenchy, Kenzo, TAG Heuer and Bulgari among others, will close its 124 boutiques in Russia from Sunday but will continue to pay the salaries for its 3,500 employees in the country, a spokesperson told Reuters. French multinational Kering, whose brands include brands as Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Boucheron among others, has two shops and 180 employees, which the company will continue to support. While affluent Russians are keen consumers of luxury goods, analysts say the proportion of luxury sales generated from Russian nationals is small compared to the industry’s main growth engines, China and the United States. Richemont, which also owns Dunhill, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Montblanc, Piaget, and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels among other brands, has around a dozen directly operated stores, mostly in Moscow. It said in a statement it had suspended commercial activities in Russia on March 3 after stopping Ukraine operations on Feb. 24, the day Russia launched its invasion. Senior US military leaders haven’t spoken with their Russian counterparts since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, officials said Friday. From Reuters: Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley had not spoken with their counterparts. Prior to Russia’s invasion, both Austin and Milley had spoken with their counterparts. A 43-year-old father and resident of Kyiv spoke to the Guardian about how life has changed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began a week ago. My son’s a very brave boy. He’s trying not to cry. He’s trying to help. But every time the siren sounds from outside the window, and we have to run downstairs to the shelter again, I can see he’s scared. But he doesn’t panic. That day I was standing with a neighbour outside in our yard. Suddenly we heard gunshots from automatic rifles close by. Later I read the news via Telegram that Russian troops were trying to infiltrate the city. It said they were liquidated. At the moment you hear gunfire, you’re not afraid – you don’t have time to be afraid, you just have to get your son to safety in the car park. The shock comes a little later, when you realise you could have been killed. More of Mike’s first-person account from Jem Bartholomew: CNN will stop broadcasting in Russia. A spokesperson for the news channel said on Friday it would cease broadcasting “while we continue to evaluate the situation and our next steps moving forward,” Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Bloomberg News said it would temporarily suspend the work of its journalists inside Russia in response to a new law passed by Putin the outlet says “criminalises independent reporting in the country”. “We have with great regret decided to temporarily suspend our news gathering inside Russia,” John Micklethwait, the Bloomberg editor-in-chief, said. “The change to the criminal code, which seems designed to turn any independent reporter into a criminal purely by association, makes it impossible to continue any semblance of normal journalism inside the country.” The BBC announced earlier today it would temporarily halt its news operation in Russia due to the new law, as has the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Journalists with Sky News were violently ambushed in Ukraine on Monday as they attempted to return to Kyiv. Harrowing footage published by the outlet on Friday shows an explosion and then a barrage of bullets hitting the team’s vehicle before they flee into a nearby warehouse. Bullets cascaded through the whole of the car, tracers, bullet flashes, windscreen glass, plastic seats, the steering wheel, and dashboard had disintegrated. We didn’t know it at the time, but we were later told by the Ukrainians that we were being ambushed by a saboteur Russian reconnaissance squad. It was professional, the rounds kept smashing into the car - they didn’t miss ... We knew we had to get out to survive, but the incoming fire was intense. One journalist took two rounds to his body armour, and another was wounded. The team has since returned to the UK. Read correspondent Stuart Ramsay’s full account here Canada’s Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) said today that they will be temporarily suspending reporting from Russia, citing a new law passed by Putin today where those intentionally spreading “fake” news could face jail time. Here’s the statement published by CBC on the matter: CBC/Radio-Canada is very concerned about new legislation passed in Russia, which appears to criminalize independent reporting on the current situation in Ukraine and Russia. In light of this situation and out of concern for the risk to our journalists and staff in Russia, we have temporarily suspended our reporting from the ground in Russia while we get clarity on this legislation. We join other media in standing up for a free press and unimpeded access to accurate, independent journalism in Ukraine and Russia. Our journalists have been doing vital work to bring all elements of this story to Canadians and people around the world. We are proud of their professionalism and determination and we will continue to support their work. Italian police have seized a yacht owned by Alexey Mordashov, once the richest man in Russia before being blacklisted by the European Union, said a source familiar with the matter to Reuters. The 215ft yacht, “Lady M,” was sequestered in the northern Italian port of Imperia, confirmed the source. A second yacht owned by billionaire Gennady Timchenko, who also has close ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, is being blocked in Imperia and will be impounded shortly, the source added. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III posted a statement to Twitter summarizing his recent talks with Polish defense minister Mariusz Błaszczak about Russia’s war on Ukraine: I spoke today with Polish Defense Minister [Mariusz Błaszczak] on our collective efforts to strengthen NATO’s deterrence and defense and to support Ukraine. I commend Poland’s extraordinary efforts, along with those of other Allies and partners, to help the Ukrainian people. #WeAreNATO Russia is not cooperating on proposed humanitarian corridors in Kherson, says Ukrainian officials, reports the Washington Post’s David Stern, Adela Suliman, and Adam Taylor: Local officials in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson said Friday that Russia is not living up to its side of the bargain on proposed “humanitarian corridors,” even as supplies of food and other necessities begin to dwindle in the region. Leaders from Ukraine and Russia announced Thursday they had agreed to temporary cease-fires to support “humanitarian corridors” for civilians to be evacuated and so food and medicine could be delivered. But local Ukrainian officials in the Kherson region say that the Russian military is not working with them and is instead pushing a plan to distribute its own aid unilaterally. Regional governor Gennady Laguta wrote on Facebook on Friday that the “occupiers” had not given the go-ahead to send humanitarian aid to the Kherson region through the proposed corridor. Laguta said that Ukrainian authorities had readied 19 trucks, but they were not yet being allowed to go in. The Russians “say that they will provide humanitarian aid themselves,” Laguta wrote. In his own message to Facebook, Kherson Mayor Ihor Kolykhaev said that the agreement was not helping the city. “Despite yesterday’s agreements at the highest level, in practice,” Kolykhaev wrote, “all this is not yet working.” “But, judging by everything, ‘good liberators’ are preparing to bring their ‘rescue’ to Kherson. First they brought the situation to a critical point, and then heroically they will save us,” Kolykhaev wrote, referring to Russia. Read the full article here (paywall). British prime minister Boris Johnson said in an interview today that he saw a “close analogy” between Russian president Vladimir Putin and late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, who was charged with war crimes, reports Agence France-Presse. Here are Johnson’s full comments from an interview he did with El País: [Interview question]: You said in the House of Commons that Putin is a war criminal. Should the West aspire to put this war criminal in front of an International court, like Milosevic or the Nuremberg trial? [Johnson’s answer] What I certainly believe is that there is a close analogy between Putin’s behavior and the last years of Slobodan Milosevic. It’s very interesting that both leaders had been in power for a long time, both increasingly autocratic, both seeking to shore up their domestic position, and found a great nationalist cause. Slobodan Milosevic identified the birthplace of Serbian nationalism, indeed the Serbian nation, in Kosovo Poljie, and he inspired his people with this misbegotten idea that it needed to be rescued and liberated. There’s a very close sort of analogy between that catastrophic mistake, and what the president of Russia has been saying about Kyiv and the origins of Russian religion and culture and civilization and his objectives in Ukraine. When it comes to the International Criminal Court, that’s a matter for them. There would have to be the gathering of evidence. If there is evidence of the use of illegal munitions, cluster bombs, barrel weapons, this clearly will have to be brought to the Netherlands. Read the full interview here. Poland has arrested a Spanish journalist on suspicion of being a Russian spy who was planning to “go to Ukraine in order to continue his activity,” Internal Security Agency (ABW) said on Friday. The suspect, identified as an “agent of Russia’s military intelligence agency (GRU)”, is currently detained in Przemysl - near Poland’s border with Ukraine on Sunday night, ABW said in a statement. The note released by the Police said he was of Russian origin. ABW said the man carried out operations to benefit Russia and travelled in Europe and elsewhere under the cover of being a journalist. His lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, told Reuters he had not yet been able to contact his client. He tweeted earlier that his client had been charged with espionage and was being held in Rzeszow prison. Spain’s foreign ministry said it had been informed by Polish authorities of the charges but could not provide any details. It said it would offer consular assistance. “Before his detention, he was planning to go to Ukraine in order to continue his activity,” said Spain’s foreign ministry. More on Russia’s ongoing online censorship: following a ban on Twitter in Russia, Youtube also appears to be blocked throughout the country. From NEXTA news: Russian state media regulator Roskomnadzor has restricted access to Twitter, confirmed Tass news agency today. Experts are weighing in on the recent ban that is sending the country into almost complete online isolation as Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine continues. From CNN’s Senior Global Affairs analyst Bianna Golodryga: And there goes Twitter in Russia. The country has been disconnected from the world. In one week a nation of 145m- hermetically sealed. With barely any objection from Putin’s Duma. They approved his “special operation” in Ukraine and his massive repression and censorship at home. From ABC foreign correspondant James Longman: I’m still able to access Facebook and Twitter in Russia. It may take time for code to trickle through, I don’t know. But for now full access. Announcing a ban on something is one thing, making sure it happens is another. Earlier today, Russia also blocked Facebook across the country, another example of online censorship that was met with stark criticism from Western countries. “We are deeply concerned about this and concerned about the threat on freedom of speech in the country,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. This just in: Russia has banned Twitter throughout the country, according to Interfax news agency. This story is developing- more details to come. Putin signed a bill into law today that introduces jail terms of up to 15 years for people publishing “fake news” about the Russian army as Russia moves forward with its invasion of Ukraine, reports Agence France-Presse. The bill, which was adopted by lawmakers earlier on Friday, sets out jail terms of varying lengths and fines against people who publish “knowingly false information” about the military, with harsher penalties to hit when dissemination is deemed to have serious consequences. Putin also signed a bill that would allow fines or jail terms of up to three years for calling for sanctions against Russia with Moscow facing harsh economic penalties from Western capitals over the invasion. The past year has seen an unprecedented crackdown on independent and critical voices in Russia that only intensified after the start of the invasion. Russia’s media watchdog said Friday it had restricted access to the BBC and other independent media websites and blocked social media giant Facebook. Two news outlets said they will stop reporting on Ukraine to protect their journalists, while the BBC announced a halt of its operations in Russia. Russian media have been instructed to only publish information provided by official sources, which describe the invasion as a military operation. State-controlled broadcasters have meanwhile reinforced government narratives about nationalism in Ukraine and Moscow’s claim that Ukrainian soldiers are using civilians as human shields. The US is currently weighing options if it decides to cut consumption of Russian energy, said the White House. From Reuters: The Biden administration is looking at options if it were to decide to cut U.S. consumption of Russian energy, White House economic adviser Cecilia Rouse said on Friday, adding that the United States does not import much Russian oil. “What’s really most important is that we maintain (a) steady supply of global energy,” Rouse told reporters at a White House news briefing, adding that the administration was “considering a range of options that we could take right now” if needed. It is 9:20 pm in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand now: Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, was seized by Russian forces on Friday, after an attack that started a fire close to one of its six reactors. No release of radiation was reported, but Ukrainian officials said workers had not been able to check all the safety infrastructure in the wake of the attack. An emergency of the UN security council was summoned following the attack on the Zaporizhzhia NPP. The US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the world narrowly averted a “nuclear catastrophe” and condemned Russia’s actions as “reckless” and “dangerous”. Seven people were killed, including two children, after a Russian air strike hit a rural residential area in the Kyiv region on Friday, Ukrainian police said. Police said the strike hit the village of Markhalivka, around 6 miles from the southwestern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. The Ukrainian city of Mariupol has no water, heat or electricity and is running out of food after coming under attack by Russian forces for the past five days, its mayor said in a televised appeal. He called for a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians from the south-eastern port city. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg warned the days to come are “likely to be worse”, calling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades”. But he stressed Nato was a “defensive alliance” and not seeking a war with Russia. Nato foreign ministers discussed a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine but agreed that Nato planes should not operate over Ukrainian airspace, Stoltenberg said. He also said Nato had evidence Russia was using cluster bombs. Russia’s parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” information about the armed forces. Russia’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper said it will remove material on Russia’s military actions in Ukraine from its website. The BBC is temporarily suspending the work of all its journalists and staff in Russia. BBC director general Tim Davie said the new legislation appeared to “criminalise the process of independent journalism”. Russia’s media watchdog Roskomnadzor said it had decided to block access to the Facebook network in Russia. It added that there had been 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020. More than 1.2m people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February, the UN said, including about half a million children. The UN human rights council overwhelmingly voted to create a top-level investigation into violations committed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with 32 members of the 47-seat council in favour and only Russia and Eritrea voting against. UK foreign secretary Liz Truss posted a statement to Twitter following an announcement today that the UK will be bolstering sanctions against Russia. From foreign secretary Liz Truss: We have shown Putin that his invasion has consequences. In addition to one of the world’s biggest sanctions packages against Russia, we are ratcheting up pressure by introducing emergency legislation to go faster and harder on Putin’s enablers. They will have nowhere to hide. Compared to other countries and the EU, the UK has sanctioned the second-lowest number of entities since the Russian invasion, according to a visual by Bloomberg: The UK is “bolstering” its package of sanctions against the Kremlin with “new powers in our arsenal to go further and faster”, Boris Johnson said. The UK prime minister said the changes will “ramp up the pressure on those criminal elites trying to launder money on UK soil”, ensuring they have “nowhere to hide”, PA news agency reports. The amendments to the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill will “help streamline the current legislation so we can respond even more swiftly and effectively to the current crisis in the way we sanction individuals”, the Foreign Office said. The FCDO said the provisions will allow the UK to align more rapidly with the individual designations imposed by allies such as the US, Canada and the EU. The changes also include shortening the length of time foreign owners of UK property will be given to declare their true identity under a new register of overseas entities, from 18 months to six months. Criminal penalties for non-compliance are set to increase from fines of up to 500 per day to up to 2,500 per day under a further amendment. About 100 people could still be trapped under rubble after a missile attack hit a large apartment block in Borodyanka, a small town 60km north-west of Kyiv, Ukraine’s state emergency service said. A spokesperson for the service told CNN that “about 100 people may be trapped under the rubble” in Borodyanka after the attack on Thursday but “it is impossible to give a more precise figure at the moment.” Rescuers do not have access to these people due to the constant shelling. We are ready to evacuate people as soon as there is an agreement on a ‘green corridor. Thousands of people living in the area near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine are unable to evacuate because of ongoing shelling by Russian forces, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations said. Speaking at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of lying about its takeover of the country’s biggest nuclear power plant. Russia’s defence ministry has blamed the overnight attack at the site of the Zaporizhzhia plant on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a “monstrous provocation”. Its account has directly contradicted Ukraine’s version of events. Ukraine has said Russian forces attacked the plant in the early hours of Friday, setting an adjacent five-storey training facility on fire. G7 foreign ministers issued a joint statement saying Russia would face further “severe sanctions” for its invasion of Ukraine, Daniel Boffey writes. We will continue to impose further severe sanctions in response to Russian aggression, enabled by the Lukashenko regime in Belarus. We urge Russia to stop its attacks especially in the direct vicinity of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants. Speaking in Brussels following a meeting of western foreign ministers, Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, said they had been given an update via videolink by Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba. They are shelling residential housing, schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructures, Borrell told reporters: It looks like they want to destroy Ukraine. Russia’s state regulator Roskomnadzor said it had decided to block access to the Facebook network in Russia. Russian state-owned news agency Ria said the country’s media watchdog had decided to block access to the social media platform. It added that there had been 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020 International students trapped in a Ukrainian town near the Russian border have made desperate appeals for evacuation, as the number thought to be stranded in Sumy has risen to between 1,200 and 1,500, Lisa O’Carroll and Emmanuel Akinwotu report. One student interviewed by Indian TV on Friday begged for immediate help, saying they were running out of food and water. Please take some immediate action or else we will die for sure. Earlier this week, it emerged that 500 foreign students were stuck in the city, including almost 400 Nigerians, three Irish students and pupils from Rwanda, Lebanon and Tanzania. Indian media are reporting that there are between 700 and 1,000 more. Aashik Hussain Sarkar, an Indian medical student, said they witnessed a massive bomb in Friday: Please evacuate us immediately. More than 1,000 Indians are waiting. One student told the Indian network NDTV they had been waiting on the street for buses to take them to the border when a loud explosion occurred and they rushed to the bunker under their student apartment block. Sumy was still under Ukrainian control, according to the students. A student said: Right now there is no electricity. There is shortage of water. When we heard that bombardment sound, we just took our passport and we ran into the bunkers. We were really so scared. This time the noise was really really extreme. We were waiting for a military pass to the border for one-and-a-half hours and at this last moment we heard this noise and we were shifted in here. Now the current situation is the Ukrainian government is now allowing us to travel to the border. The world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe overnight when a fire broke out during a Russian seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the US ambassador to the United Nations said. Speaking at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia’s actions were “reckless” and “dangerous”. By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night. We all waited to exhale as we watched the horrific situation unfold in real time. The attack overnight reflected a “dangerous new escalation” in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, she said, warning that “imminent danger” persisted, citing Russian troops whom she said were 20 miles from Ukraine’s second-largest nuclear facility. Russia’s attack last night put Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at grave risk. It was incredibly reckless and dangerous. And it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe. She demanded assurances from Moscow that such an assault will not happen again. Microsoft has joined Apple in suspending product sales in Russia, Dan Milmo reports. The US tech firm provides the software behind more than a billion devices worldwide, as well as providing cloud computing services and being a major player in gaming through the Xbox. Microsoft said it would “suspend all new sales of Microsoft products and services” in Russia, but declined to elaborate on how the policy would be applied. Like the rest of the world, we are horrified, angered and saddened by the images and news coming from the war in Ukraine and condemn this unjustified, unprovoked and unlawful invasion by Russia, Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a blog post. On Tuesday Apple said it halted sales of its products in Russia, while social media companies including Facebook owner Meta have blocked Russian state-owned media services across Europe. Microsoft also said it has also taken action over harmful cyberattacks against the Ukrainian state. Since the war began, we have acted against Russian positioning, destructive or disruptive measures against more than 20 Ukrainian government, IT and financial sector organizations, Smith’s blog said. A video filmed in the Ukrainian town shows crumpled shops, buildings blackened by fire, and a road strewn with debris. Residents say the barrage of shelling, rocket assaults and airstrikes since the start of the war have damaged or destroyed nearly every building in Volnovakha. The US state department has reportedly urged US embassies in Europe not to share a tweet posted by the US embassy in Kyiv calling the attack on the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant by Russia a war crime, CNN reports. Earlier today the US embassy in Kyiv said attacking a nuclear power plant is a war crime after Russian forces seized Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant on Friday in heavy fighting in southeastern Ukraine, triggering global alarm. CNN has reviewed an “urgent” message from the US state department to all US embassies in Europe telling them not to retweet the US Embassy Kyiv’s tweet. All – do not/not retweet Embassy Kyiv’s tweet on shelling of the facility being a possible war crime. If you have retweeted it – un-retweet it ASAP. The message is an indication that the US government may not be endorsing the war crime allegation made by the embassy, the news channel writes. Seven people were killed, including two children, after a Russian air strike hit a rural residential area in the Kyiv region on Friday, Ukrainian police have said. Police said the strike hit the village of Markhalivka, around 6 miles from the southwestern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov shared a photo of Markhalivka, where he claimed three children had died as a result of a Russian attack. Here’s more on the impact of new Russian legislation that could jail anyone found to be intentionally spreading “fake” news. Russia’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper said it will remove material on Russia’s military actions in Ukraine from its website because of censorship. The newspaper, whose editor Dmitry Muratov was a co-winner of last year’s Nobel peace prize, said it would remove all of its war coverage due to the threat of criminal prosecution its journalists and readers could face. In a statement, Novaya Gazeta would continue to report on the consequences that Russia is facing, including a deepening economic crisis and the persecution of dissidents. Military censorship in Russia has quickly moved into a new phase: from the threat of blocking and closing publications (almost fully implemented) it has moved to the threat of criminal prosecution of both journalists and citizens who spread information about military hostilities that is different from the press releases of the Ministry of Defense. There is no doubt that this threat will be realised. The newspaper said it could not risk the freedom of its staff but also could not ignore its readers’ desire for it to continue working, even under military censorship. It would therefore remove materials “on this topic” from its website and social networks. We continue to report on the consequences that Russia is facing: the developing economic crisis, the rapid decline in living standards, problems with access to foreign medicines and technologies, and the persecution of dissidents, including for anti-war statements. The BBC is temporarily suspending the work of all its journalists and staff in Russia after Russian authorities passed new legislation making the spread of “fake” information an offence punishable with fines or jail terms. On Friday, Russia’s parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military. They also imposed fines for public calls for sanctions against Russia. Russian officials have repeatedly accused the west of spreading false information in an attempt to sow discord among the Russin people. BBC director general Tim Davie said the new legislation appeared to “criminalise the process of independent journalism”. It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspend the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development. Our BBC News service in Russian will continue to operate from outside Russia. He continued: The safety of staff is paramount and we are not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs. I’d like to pay tribute to all of them, for their bravery, determination and professionalism. We remain committed to making accurate, independent information available to audiences around the world, including the millions of Russians who use our news services. Our journalists in Ukraine and around the world will continue to report on the invasion of Ukraine. For more detail and reaction to this you can follow our UK live blog: Footage shared on social media shows the aftermath of a Russian strike in the city of Chernihiv, north of Kyiv. A large block of flats is seen with severe structural damage and windows blown out, and people are heard screaming. Russian forces were driven out of the Ukrainian city of Mykolayiv after attacking it on Friday, regional authorities said. Some fighting continued around the outskirts of the Black Sea port city, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said. It comes after the governor said Russian troops had entered Mykolayiv for the first time this morning. “Let’s not get nervous,” he said in a video statement shared online. The Ukrainian city of Mariupol has no water, heat or electricity and is running out of food after coming under attack by Russian forces for the past five days, its mayor said in a televised appeal. Vadym Boychenko, mayor of Mariupol, said called for a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians from the south-eastern port city. We are simply being destroyed. Earlier this afternoon, a senior US official told reporters that Mariupol remains under Ukrainian control, though Russian troops are continuing to advance and bombard the city, causing utility outages. The US is committed to doing everything needed to stop the war in Ukraine, secretary of state Antony Blinken said. Blinken praised the EU for “historic” steps it has taken against Russia: We are faced together with what is President Putin’s war of choice: unprovoked, unjustified, and a war that is having horrific, horrific consequences for real people. For mothers, fathers. For children. We see the images on TV, and it has to stop. Standing alongside the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, Blinken added: We’re committed to doing everything we can to make it stop. So the coordination between us is vital. The Pentagon has established a new hotline with Russia’s ministry of defence to prevent “miscalculation, military incidents and escalation” in the region as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine advances, a US official told Reuters on Thursday. The US says it has no troops in Ukraine but it and Nato allies in Europe are worried about potential spillover, including accidents, as Russia stages the largest assault on a European state since the second world war. The US and its allies are also channeling millions of dollars’ worth of weaponry to Ukraine’s armed forces, which are using the arms against Russian troops, despite Moscow’s warnings against foreign interference. “The Department of the Defence recently established a de-confliction line with the Russian ministry of defence on March 1 for the purposes of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation,” a senior US defence official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirming a move first reported by NBC. International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons gave one of the most political speeches at an Olympics and Paralympics opening ceremony for decades, as he opened the Beijing 2022 Winter Paralympics saying: “I want – I must – begin with a message of peace as the leader of our organisation. I am horrified at what is taking place in the world right now. The 21st century is a time for dialogue and diplomacy, not war and hate.” Throwing away decades of tradition of only making guarded comments at such events, Parsons continued: “The Olympic Truce for peace during the Olympic and Paralympic Games is a UN resolution. It must be respected and observed, not violated. At the IPC we aspire to a better and more inclusive growth, free from discrimination, free from hate, free from ignorance, and free from conflict.” He finished his speech by almost bellowing the word “Peace”. In 2014 in Sochi, the Ukrainian Winter Paralympics team had staged a symbolic protest, sending only one athlete to the opening ceremony to represent them as Russian troops invaded the Crimean peninsula. Eight years later, with their country again under attack from Russia, the scene was very different. Maksym Yarovyi carried in his nation’s flag ahead of a full delegation, whose arrival in China had been fraught, while the Russian delegation announced that they would be leaving China rather than filing an immediate legal appeal over their expulsion. Microsoft said on Friday it was suspending new sales of its products and services in Russia, becoming the latest major Western company to distance itself from Moscow after the country’s invasion A string of Western companies, including Nike, Apple, H&amp;M and Ikea had already severed relations with Russia as Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine enters its 8th day. In a statement published on Thursday, Ikea said their decisions to suspend operations will “have a direct impact on 15,000 IKEA co-workers” in Russia. In addition to suspending new sales, Microsoft said it was also stopping many aspects of its business in Russia in compliance with US sanctions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Western sanctions that followed in response have led to dire predictions about the Russian economy. The US bank JPMorgan on Thursday forecasted that the country will face a 35% contraction in the second quarter, as the Russian rouble slumped to new record lows against the dollar. The US Embassy in Ukraine said that attacking a nuclear power plant is a war crime after Russia seized a Ukrainian nuclear facility, the biggest in Europe. “It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant. Putin’s shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further,” US Embassy Kyiv said in its post. Russian forces seized Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant on Friday in heavy fighting in southeastern Ukraine, triggering global alarm, but a huge blaze in a training building has been extinguished and officials said the facility was now safe. Russia’s defence ministry spuriously blamed a fire at the plant on a “monstrous attack” by Ukrainian saboteurs and said its forces were in control, Reuters reported. The European Union wants Ukraine to become a member state “as soon as possible”, commissioner Maros Sefcovic told journalists on Friday after a ministers’ meeting. “It’s time for signalling that the Ukrainian people is one of the European peoples and we want them in as soon as possible”, he said, but added that at the moment the bloc needed to focus on short-term measures linked to the war. “I think what (...) is the most important now is to help Ukraine in the fight”, he added. The UN human rights office said it had confirmed 331 civilians have been killed and 675 injured in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began on 24 February, adding that the real toll was likely much higher. The toll, up until midnight on Thursday, rose from 249 in its previous report from a day earlier, Reuters reported. Among the 331 killed were 19 children, the UN said. Most of the victims were killed by explosive weapons such as shelling from heavy artillery, multi-launch rocket systems and missile and air strikes, according to the rights office, which has monitors in Ukraine. The United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency meeting at 11:30am ET (4:30pm GMT) in New York, diplomatic sources said. The emergency meeting has been called in response to the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by Russian troops. The session was requested by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, diplomats told AFP, with the United States, France, Norway, Ireland and Albania joining the call for an urgent meeting. It will include speeches from an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) official and a UN official. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appealed to Russians to stage protests over Russian forces’ seizure of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. A building at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was set ablaze during intense fighting, triggering fears of a potential nuclear disaster. More than 1.2m people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February, according to figures by the United Nations. Around half of a million of those who have fled are youngsters, the UN children’s agency UNICEF estimates. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has projected that more than four million Ukrainian refugees may eventually need protection and assistance. UNCHR communications chief Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams described the rate of the exodus as “phenomenal”. We know that there are many more on the move. Also there are possibly equal numbers inside the country that are internally displaced. Russia is using cluster bombs in Ukraine, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said. We have seen the use of cluster bombs and we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law. Nato foreign ministers discussed a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine but agreed that Nato planes should not operate over Ukrainian airspace, Stoltenberg said. Establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine could result in the war spreading to more European countries, the Nato secretary general. Speaking to reporters in Brussels after a meeting with Nato foreign ministers, he said: We understand the desperation but we also believe that if we did that (establishing a no-fly zone) we would end up with something that could lead to a fully-fledged war in Europe, involving much more countries. Allies agreed not to have Nato planes operating in Ukrainian airspace or Nato troops on Ukraine’s territory, he said. At the same time, we have a responsibility as Nato allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering. Asked about the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the Nato secretary general said: The reckless actions around the nuclear power plant last night just highlights the dangers of this war. War is dangerous and to have military operations conflict fighting going around the nuclear power plant adds to the danger. Stoltenberg stressed that Nato is not seeking a war with Russia. Speaking in Brussels, he said Nato is a “defensive” alliance. “Our core task is to keep our 30 nations safe,” he said. We are not part of this conflict and we have a responsibility to ensure it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine. That would be even more devastating and more dangerous, with even more human suffering. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has warned that the days to come are “likely to be worse” with Russian forces expected to bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across Ukraine. Speaking after an extraordinary meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Stoltenberg described Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades”. With cities under siege, schools, hospitals, and residential buildings shelled. Reckless actions around a nuclear power plant last night and many civilians killed or wounded. The days to come are likely to be worse, with more death, more sufferings, and more destruction. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has strongly condemned the shelling of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant and called for the international community to force Russia to withdraw its forces from the plant. In a statement posted on Facebook, the ministry said the Zaporizhzhya NPP and Chernobyl NPP are currently under the control of Russian armed forces. As a result of the shelling on the territory of the (Zaporizhzhya) nuclear power plant, a fire broke out, killing and injuring several people. The fire has now been extinguished. It warned that if the cooling of the nuclear fuel within the Zaporizhzhya plant is disturbed, it could cause radioactive damage and have “irreparable consequences for Europe’s environment”. Thousands of people – including civilians who are currently unable to evacuate the area near the plant due to ongoing shelling and fighting - would be hurt by this. The ministry added that it was disappointed by the reaction of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and demanded “clear and decisive action” from the UN atomic agency. No release of radioactive material has been detected at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after a military projectile hit a nearby building on the site, UN atomic chief Rafael Grossi has said. Two members of security staff were injured when the projectile struck after the Ukrainian authorities reported an overnight battle with Russian troops near Europe’s biggest power plant. In an update, Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, said the nuclear power plant continued to be operated by its regular staff. The safety systems of the plant’s six reactors had not been affected and there has been no release of radioactive material. Radiation monitoring systems at the site are fully functional. The situation “remains very challenging”, Grossi added, and it has not yet been possible to access the whole site to determine if all systems are fully functional. I’m extremely concerned about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and what happened there during the night. Firing shells in the area of a nuclear power plant violates the fundamental principle that the physical integrity of nuclear facilities must be maintained and kept safe at all time. The UN human rights council has voted overwhelmingly for a resolution condemning alleged rights violations by Russia in Ukraine and setting up a commission of inquiry to investigate them. Only Eritrea voted with Russia against the resolution brought by Ukraine, while 13 abstained. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Yevheniia Filipenko, told the council there was “irrefutable evidence of gross and systematic human rights violations as well as war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia”. It is our common duty to ensure accountability by mandating the documentation and verification of Russia’s crimes and identification of those responsible. Vladimir Putin has warned Russia’s neighbours “not to escalate the situation” by imposing more restrictions on his country. Speaking at a government meeting broadcast today, the Russian president said: There are no bad intentions towards our neighbours. I would also advise them not to escalate the situation, not to introduce any restrictions. We fulfil all our obligations and will continue to fulfil them. Russia did not see “any need” to “aggravate or worsen” relations with other countries, he continued. All our actions, if they arise, they always arise exclusively in response to some unfriendly actions, actions against the Russian Federation. Ukraine’s culture ministry has called for closing the skies over Ukraine because Russian forces are “destroying Ukrainian cultural sites”. Oleksandr Tkachenko, Ukraine’s minister of culture and information policy, said most of Putin’s “war crimes” in his country had been “committed from the air”, according to a statement by the ministry. Russia’s missiles and planes are deliberately destroying historic centres of big cities. Putin wants to destroy Europe’s heritage and culture, wipe it from the face of the earth. The statement warned: A mad dictator threatens to destroy St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, a Unesco church built in the 11th century. Hundreds of innocent victims, the total destruction of churches, cathedrals and museums – is the price of the still opened sky over Ukraine. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you as we unpack all the latest developments on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Otaci is a Moldovan border town, on the opposite side of the Dniester River lies the Ukrainian city of Mohyliv-Podilskyi. As refugees spill over the bridge that links the two, local people are rallying together to provide them with warm food, shelter, internet and free onward travel in cars and taxis. Since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine started on 24 February, more than 1 million people have fled across the closest borders. The conflict could result in the “largest refugee crisis this century”, the UN refugee agency has warned, with up to 4 million people fleeing the country in the coming weeks and months. So far, more than 98,000 refugees have entered Moldova, Europe’s poorest country. The time in Ukraine is 1.05pm. Here is a roundup of the main stories from the day so far: A fire broke out in a training building outside a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday after shelling by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. After burning for at least four hours amid reports Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze, Ukrainian emergency services confirmed the blaze was extinguished at 6.20am local time. The power plant has reportedly been seized by Russian military forces, according to regional authorities. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier said it had put its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at Zaporizhzhia. However, US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm provided reassurance surrounding the Zaporizhzhia power plant reactors, saying there was no elevated radiation readings near the facility and the plant’s reactors are “protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made a fresh appeal to Europe for help following the attack on the nuclear plant. He said: We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism.” Nato’s secretary general Jens Stontenberg has said the attacks by Russia on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest in Europe – highlight the “recklessness” of Vladimir Putin’s war. Forty-seven people were killed in Russian airstrikes on a residential district of the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv on Thursday, regional authorities said. Russia’s communications watchdog has restricted access to several foreign news organisations’ websites including the BBC and Deutsche Welle for spreading what it described as ‘false information’, amid friction about reporting on Ukraine. Russian forces continue to control both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on the capital. Vladimir Putin is “at risk” of ending up in prison for war crimes carried out by his Russian forces in Ukraine, the British justice secretary said on Friday. The Russian parliament has passed a law that makes it a criminal offence to spread “fake” information about its armed forces. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. I’ll be back at 2pm but my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly. The UK Home Office has rejected suggestions that immigration minister Kevin Foster refused to appear before a parliamentary committee to discuss the growing refugee crisis. The home affairs committee has urged him to rethink “given the urgency of the situation”. In a statement, it said: Parliamentary under-secretary of state for immigration and future borders, Kevin Foster MP, has declined an invitation from the home affairs committee to give evidence on the UK’s response to the Ukraine refugee crisis. The committee had issued the invitation to understand what the UK was doing to provide support and refuge to people leaving Ukraine following the invasion by Russia. It is estimated that 1 million people have been displaced by the conflict. Given the urgency of the situation, the committee has asked the minister to reconsider. A Home Office spokesperson said: Home Office ministers are busy responding to the situation in Ukraine at this critical time, including helping reunite thousands of families in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme. Minister Foster has not refused to attend but asked for a later date given this urgent work. Following the news that the BBC has been blocked in Russia, the outlet has been quick to remind people it can be accessed via the ‘dark web’. The BBC linked to an article from 2019 on Twitter that helps users access its content in restricted countries. However, if it is already blocked for the user, the Twitter page also provides some direct links for “dark web” access to its news website. Russia’s communications watchdog has restricted access to several foreign news organisations’ websites including the BBC and Deutsche Welle for spreading what it described as ‘false information’, amid friction about reporting on Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly complained that western media organisations offer a partial – and often anti-Russian – view of the world while failing to hold their own leaders to account for devastating foreign wars such as Iraq and corruption, Reuters reported. The watchdog said on Friday it had blocked the BBC, Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Deutsche Welle and other media outlets, Interfax news agency reported. The BBC said it would not be deterred. “Access to accurate, independent information is a fundamental human right which should not be denied to the people of Russia, millions of whom rely on BBC News every week,” it said. “We will continue our efforts to make BBC News available in Russia, and across the rest of the world.” Some users in Russia could not access the BBC’s website on Friday. Following the fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant the director general of the International Atomic Energy Authority, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said on Friday that he has offered to travel to the Chernobyl site to facilitate a negotiation between Ukraine and Russia. The aim would be to agree a framework to guarantee safety of nuclear plants during the conflict, including how to ensure the physical integrity of sites, maintaining power, safety monitoring systems and that staff at sites are able to fulfil duties. Both sides are considering the proposal. “The situation continues to be extremely tense and challenging,” said Grossi. He added: The physical integrity of the plant has been compromised with what happened last night. we are fortunate that there was no release of radiation and the integrity of the reactors themselves were not compromised. I have indicated to both the Russian Federation and Ukraine my availability and disposition to travel to Chernobyl as soon as possible. Two experts have offered some reassurance that the military activity at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is unlikely to cause a major nuclear incident. Dr Mark Wenman, reader in nuclear materials at Imperial College London, said: The Zaporizhzia nuclear plant has six VVER-1000 pressurised water reactor units producing 20% of Ukraine’s electricity. The plant is a relatively modern reactor design and as such the essential reactor components are housed inside a heavily steel reinforced concrete containment building that can withstand extreme external events, both natural and man-made, such as an aircraft crash or explosions. The reactor core is itself further housed in a sealed steel pressure vessel with 20cm thick walls. The design is a lot different to the Chernobyl reactor, which did not have a containment building, and hence there is no real risk, in my opinion, at the plant now the reactors have been safely shut down. Prof Tom Scott, at the University of Bristol, UK said: Shelling nuclear power plants is against the Geneva conventions and this is obviously very worrying. The good news is that radiation levels around the plant are reportedly normal and five of the six reactors are now turned off, with one still operating. The reactors are all pressurised water reactors and hence don’t have graphite cores which could set on fire as per Chernobyl. Their inherent safety design should mean they are naturally quite resilient to any external perturbations and hence I am not overly concerned that inadvertent damage could cause a major nuclear incident. However, it would be more concerning if the reactors were being deliberately targeted to induce a nuclear incident. Ahead of a busy day of diplomacy in Brussels, Nato’s secretary general Jens Stontenberg has said the attacks by Russia on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest in Europe – highlight the “recklessness” of Vladimir Putin’s war. He said: We condemn the attacks on civilians and overnight we have also seen the reports about the attacks against a nuclear power plant. This just shows the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it. And the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops and engaging in good faith in diplomatic efforts. British foreign secretary Liz Truss is in Brussels for a meeting of Nato ministers and later she will join EU foreign ministers who are also hosting Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, US secretary of state Anthony Blinken, Canada’s foreign minister Mélanie Joly and Stoltenberg. Russia’s defence ministry has sought to blame an attack at the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Ukrainian saboteurs. Ukraine said Russian forces attacked the plant in the early hours of Friday, setting an adjacent five-storey training facility on fire, in an incident that provoked international condemnation of Moscow, a week into its invasion of Ukraine. A Russian defence ministry spokesman said the nuclear plant was operating normally and the area had been under Russian control since 28 February, Reuters reported. “However, last night on the territory adjacent to the power plant, an attempt was made by the Kyiv nationalist regime to carry out a monstrous provocation,” spokesman Igor Konashenkov was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed directly to Russians to stage protests over the seizure of nuclear power infrastructure by Russian troops in Ukraine. “Russian people, I want to appeal to you: how is this possible? After all we fought together in 1986 against the Chernobyl catastrophe,” he said in a televised address. In the UK, the mayor of Salford has written to Michael Gove to ask for help to cut ties with the Russian energy firm Gazprom, warning that “state-owned and/or backed Russian organisations and services are still woven inextricably into the delivery of Local Government services within the United Kingdom”. Paul Dennett wants his local authority not to have to renew its non-domestic natural gas contract with Gazprom, agreed in June 2020 when the Russian firm far outbid domestic providers. He says that councils across the country also use Gazprom because it is so much cheaper than other companies and so automatically wins procurement competitions. Gazprom also provides energy to a number of NHS trusts. On Thursday, the health secretary Sajid Javid began talks with NHS England (NHSE) over ending the contracts, which are reported by Politico to have been worth £16m in 2021. “Our contract will be up for renewal in June, and I do not wish for public money to be spent towards the income of the Russian state during the present military crisis in Ukraine. However, at present under the current round of sanctions and/or rules, such considerations would seemingly not be considered legally relevant in assessing Gazprom’s suitability for winning the next tendering exercise (or not),” Dennett writes in a letter to Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up. Dennett says Salford is fully supportive of the government’s stated ambitions to “inflict devastating consequences on President Vladimir Putin and Russia” following Russia’s unprovoked assault on the sovereign nation of Ukraine, using sanctions and other financial measures. “However, state-owned and/or backed Russian organisations and services are still woven inextricably into the delivery of local government services within the United Kingdom, and at present their involvement in bidding for tenders and contracts is enshrined in UK public procurement regulations for the procurement and tendering of services,” writes Dennett. He wants Gove to change the law to make it easier for local authorities to break ties with Gazprom and stop Gazprom pitching for replacement contracts, even if it means having to pay more for municipal energy. Forty-seven people were killed in Russian airstrikes on a residential district of the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv on Thursday, regional authorities said. It updates an earlier announced death toll of 33 killed, the Reuters news agency reported. Rescue work had to be suspended on Thursday due to heavy shelling, according to the local emergency services. Vladimir Putin is “at risk” of ending up in prison for war crimes carried out by his Russian forces in Ukraine, the British justice secretary said on Friday. Dominic Raab, who is also deputy prime minister, was asked on Times Radio whether he saw the conflict ending with the Russian president “imprisoned for war crimes”. He said: I think it is a very real risk that he must now contemplate. Beyond his personal situation, every commander operating in Ukraine, or indeed Moscow, when they are faced with illegal orders, whether it is to target civilians or otherwise, attack illegal or unlawful sites, they now know the ICC (international criminal court) is investigating and the chief prosecutor Karim Khan is, I believe, travelling to Ukraine. They must now know that they face the very real risk of ending up in the dock of a court and, ultimately, in a prison if they follow through on those illegal, unlawful orders. Canada wants Nato to discuss all scenarios to isolate Russia, the country’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, said when asked whether the alliance should consider a no-fly zone over Ukraine. On her arrival at an extraordinary meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Joly said Nato’s red line was to avoid triggering an international conflict, when asked about the no-fly zone, Reuters reported. But she added: “We want to make sure that scenarios are being discussed”. Meanwhile, Romania’s foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, said Nato must adapt military posture at its eastern flank to new reality after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We have to adapt the posture to the reality, which shows that the Russians troops are in Ukraine and in Belarus, so we need to rethink everything,” he told reporters as he arrived for a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. Romania will increase its defence spending to 2.5% from 2% of GDP starting with the next fiscal year, he added. The Russian parliament has passed a law which makes it a criminal offence to spread “fake” information about its armed forces. The law, passed by the state Duma in the third and final reading, introduces fines and jail sentences for those who intentionally spread false information about the armed forces that has a serious impact, according to a statement by the lower house. Those found to have broken the new law by spreading so-called “false information” about the actions of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine face up to three years in prison. If it is published as part of an “organised group” or uses “false evidence”, the maximum sentence increases to 10 years in prison. If it leads to “serious consequences”, the perpetrators will face up to 15 years in prison. It is thought this new law will have a huge effect of the ability of people to share information about what is happening in Ukraine, as the Kremlin continues to play down its actions to the Russian population. Latvia’s foreign minister has said Nato should “consider all options” when asked about entering direct conflict with Russia. Edgars Rinkēvičs told the BBC’s Today programme that governments “should not exclude” any recourse to stop the invasion. Earlier, the programme heard from former Ukrainian prime minister Oleksiy Honcharuk, who said other European countries “don’t understand” the lengths Putin will go to, PA Media reported. He said leaders from other countries should offer direct military support and “at least to close our skies to protect us from the threat”. Asked about the comments, Mr Rinkevics said: I think we should consider all options but we should also understand, let’s say, some Nato policies can be implemented only if those countries that have necessary assets agree on that. He added that any decision would have to be voted for unanimously. Asked whether Nato may instead be forced to broker an “uncomfortable” settlement with Russia, the minister replied: Well, I think we must do everything that we can. That’s why I’m saying that we should not exclude any options. I’m Tom Ambrose and will be bringing you all the latest news over the next couple of hours. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has reportedly been seized by Russian military forces, according to regional authorities. An update written at 7.30am on the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine’s Facebook page reads: The Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is captured by the military forces of the Russian Federation.” However, the inspectorate says employees are continuing to work on the premises, while operational personnel control the safe condition of the power units. According to the inspectorate units two and three have been disconnected from the network and and nuclear installations are being cooled down “Changes in the radiation state for the current time have not been recorded,” the update adds. However, the potential loss of cooling nuclear fuel could lead to “significant radioactive emissions into the environment” and such an event “may outgrow all previous NPP accidents, including the Chernobyl NPP and Fukusima-Daichi NPP” the authority says, adding that any damage to a reservoir of processed nuclear fuel as a result of the shelling could also lead to radioactive discharge. Here is where we stand so far: A fire broke out in a training building outside a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday after shelling by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. After burning for at least four hours amid reports Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze, Ukrainian emergency services confirmed the fire was extinguished at 6.20am local time. Fighting at the plant has also reportedly stopped, according to the mayor of Enerhodar, a town located south-east of the plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier said it had put its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at Zaporizhzhia. However, US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm provided reassurance surrounding the Zaporizhzhia power plant reactors, saying there was no elevated radiation readings near the facility and the plant’s reactors are “protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made another appeal to Europe for help following the attack on the nuclear plant. He said: We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism.” British prime minister Boris Johnson called Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe. Share prices fell in Asia in the wake of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant fire while the Moscow stock exchange remained closed for the fifth day in a row on Friday. Russian forces continue to control both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv. In a televised speech, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence. Vladimir Putin earlier told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, France’s presidential Élysée Palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.” The UK Ministry of Defence has just released its latest intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine. The ministry noted that Mariupol remains under Ukrainian control but has “likely been encircled by Russian forces” while the city’s civilian infrastructure has been subjected to intense Russian strikes. It also confirmed receiving reports from Ukrainian authorities of a building at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant catching fire after shelling by Russian forces. Meanwhile, the Moscow stock exchange remained closed for the fifth day in a row on Friday as Russian authorities rolled out additional measures to limit the economic impact from imposed sanctions, the Moscow Times reports. Share prices fell in Asia today in the wake of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant fire. Tokyo and Hong Kong faced the steepest falls, with Japan’s benchmark Nikkei index 2.5% lower and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong down by 2.6%. Oil prices rose in Asia morning trade, with Brent crude above $112 a barrel. Meanwhile, bulls have surged into the US crude oil options market in recent days as futures touch highs not seen in a decade, betting that crude’s rally will persist, according to analysts and exchange data cited by Reuters. The global oil market was already tight even before Russia invaded Ukraine last week, which has since sent benchmark Brent and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures soaring over 15% to about 10- and 14-year highs, respectively. US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc will not pre-emptively ban all Russians from using the platform, chief executive officer Brian Armstrong said in a tweet on Friday. “We don’t think there’s a high risk of Russian oligarchs using crypto to avoid sanctions,” Armstrong said, adding that “some ordinary Russians are using crypto as a lifeline now that their currency has collapsed”. Meanwhile, home rental company Airbnb Inc is suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus, according to chief executive officer Brian Chesky. Essential equipment at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been unaffected from an earlier fire, with no change in radiation levels, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said, citing Ukraine’s regulatory authorities. “The Ukraine regulatory authority said a fire at the site had not affected ‘essential’ equipment and plant personnel were taking mitigatory actions,” it said. “There was no reported change in radiation levels at the plant.” US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm earlier provided more reassurance surrounding the reactors at the power station, confirming she had spoken with Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko. In an update posted to Twitter, Granholm said: We have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility. The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.” According to a statement, the IAEE said Ukraine had informed the agency before the fire broke out that a large number of Russian tanks and infantry “broke through the block-post” to the town of Enerhodar, a few kilometres from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP). British prime minister Boris Johnson has spoken with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy after news broke about a fire at the nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhia, calling Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe. A Downing Street spokeswoman called the situation “gravely concerning”. PA Media reports the spokeswoman said: Both leaders agreed that Russia must immediately cease its attack on the power station and allow unfettered access for emergency services to the plant. The prime minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe. He said the UK would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further. The prime minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN security council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners. Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial.” A charter aircraft carrying Russian foreign nationals was held at the Yellowknife airport in Canada’s Northwest Territories, transport minister Omar Alghabra said in a tweet on Thursday. “We will continue to hold Russia accountable for its invasion of Ukraine,” Alghabra added. It remains unclear whether the passengers were transported to their onwards destination. According to the New York Times, two Russian nationals flying in a private jet that had taken off from Geneva landed in northern Canada this week and were prevented from travelling farther, citing Canadian officials. Canada announced on Sunday that it would ban Russian aircraft from entering Canadian airspace in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The United States and the European Union have similar policies in place. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy early this morning made appeal to Europe for help following the attack on Ukraine’s nuclear plant. Europe must wake up now. The largest nuclear station in Europe is on fire. Right now Russian tanks are shelling nuclear units. Those are the tanks that have thermal vision, so they know where they are shelling. They prepared for it. I address all Ukrainians and all Europeans to all people who know the word Chernobyl who know how much suffering and victims were caused by the explosion at the nuclear station. It was a global disaster. Hundreds of thousands of people fought against its consequences. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated. Russia wants to repeat it but six times harder. Europeans, please, wake up. Tell your politicians, Russian troops are shelling [the] Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the city of Enerhodar. There are 6 energy unit. Six. One unit exploded in Chernobyl. We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism. Russian propagandists threatened to cover the world with nuclear ashes. Now it’s not a threat. It’s a reality. We don’t know how the fire at the station will end, when an explosion will happen, god willing, it won’t happen. Our guys always kept the station safe, so there were no provocations, so that nobody could seize the station, so that nobody could plant mines at the station then blackmail the whole world with a nuclear disaster. We must stop Russian troops. Tell your politicians: Ukraine is 15 nuclear units. If there will be an explosion, it will the end to all of us, the end of Europe, the evacuation of Europe. Only immediate action of Europe can stop Russian troops and prevent the death of Europe from the disaster at a nuclear station.” Guardian reporters Calla Wahlquist and Donna Lu have compiled an explainer on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant with all the details you need to know. You can read their full report below. Guardian reporter, Luke Harding, is currently in Lviv, western Ukraine where he says demoralised Russian soldiers tell of their anger at being “duped” into war. Eight days after Vladimir Putin’s invasion it is clear that a significant number of his servicemen are demoralised and reluctant to fight. Some have given themselves up. Others have abandoned their vehicles and have set off back towards the Russian border on foot, lugging their weapons and kitbags, videos suggest. These episodes do not mean that the Kremlin will fail in its attempts to conquer Ukraine, as its tactics shift to brutal shelling of civilians. But low morale among invading troops might be one reason why Russia’s blitzkrieg plan to overwhelm Ukraine appears not to have progressed at the speed Putin would have wanted. The assumption in Moscow was that the operation would be swift and successful. Soldiers were given food and fuel supplies for only two or three days, the videos suggest. The Kremlin also appears to have had a totally fantastical idea of the reception they would get. Several prisoners of war said they had been assured Ukrainians would welcome them as liberators. Russian forces were expecting flowers and cheers, not bullets and bombs, they said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier accused Russia of nuclear terrorism after a fire burned for several hours at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant early Friday morning. The shelling of the nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, prompted widespread concern about the safety of Ukraine’s atomic infrastructure. “We are warning everybody – not a single state apart from Russia has ever shelled nuclear reactors,” Zelenskiy said. “It is the first time in our history, in the history of humankind, that the terrorist state turned to nuclear terrorism.” Watch the video of Zelenskiy’s remarks below. Ukrainian emergency services confirmed just a short while ago that a fire which had broken out in the training building of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant was extinguished after a blaze burned for at least four hours throughout early Friday morning. Ukrainian authorities said the fire was ignited by shelling from Russian forces, claiming Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze. At 6.20am local time, Ukraine’s State Emergency Services issued an update published to their social media channels: At 06:20 the fire in the training building of Zaporizhzhya NPP in Energodar was extinguished.” According to the agency, no casualties have so far been reported. Fighting at the plant also reportedly stopped, according to the mayor of Enerhodar, a town located south-east of the plant. It is 7.20am in Ukraine as Russia’s war enters its ninth day.

The EU executive was accused of trying to bury the proposals by releasing long-delayed technical rules on its green investment guidebook to diplomats on New Year’s Eve, hours before a deadline expired. The draft proposals seen by the Guardian would allow gas and nuclear to be included in the EU “taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities”, subject to certain conditions. The taxonomy is a classification system intended to direct billions to clean-energy projects to meet the EU goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Robert Habeck, who became the economy and climate action minister last month as part of a traffic-light coalition of Social Democrats, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens, said the plans “water down the good label for sustainability”. Habeck, a co-leader of the Greens, also told the German press agency dpa it was “questionable whether this greenwashing will even find acceptance on the financial market”. Austria’s government repeated its threat to sue the commission if the plans go ahead. Leonore Gewessler, the country’s climate action minister, said neither gas nor nuclear belonged in the taxonomy “because they are harmful to the climate and the environment and destroy the future of our children”. She added: “We will examine the current draft carefully and have already commissioned a legal opinion on nuclear power in the taxonomy. If these plans are implemented in this way, we will sue.” She also accused the commission of a “a night and fog operation” in the timing of the publication, a charge echoed by Luxembourg’s energy minister, Claude Turmes, who described the draft as a provocation. However, opponents are not expected to secure the supermajority needed to block the plans. France and other pro-nuclear states, such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, support the inclusion of nuclear, while many governments in central, eastern and southern Europe lobbied for gas to be included as a “bridge” fuel. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner of the FDP, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung on Sunday that Germany needed gas-fired power plants as a transition technology because it was foregoing coal and nuclear power. “I am grateful that arguments were apparently taken up by the commission,” he said. He was speaking after Germany closed three of its six nuclear power plants on Friday, to meet a pledge of phasing out the technology by the end of 2022. France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said the proposal was good on a technical level and the EU could not reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 without nuclear power. Under the draft, gas could only be classed as a “sustainable investment” if “the same energy capacity cannot be generated with renewable sources” and plans are in place to switch to renewables or “low carbon gases” by a specific date. Nuclear power could only be included if a project demonstrated it had a plan to deal with radioactive waste. NGOs accused the commission of seeking to evade scrutiny. WWF, a member of an official expert group on the taxonomy, said the commission had allowed just eight working days – until 12 January – to provide a formal response “to this highly complex and controversial file”, whereas most Brussels consultations last four weeks. “The European Commission couldn’t have tried harder to bury this proposal,” said the WWF spokesperson on sustainable finance, Henry Eviston. “For fossil gas and nuclear, we get a document written behind closed doors and published on New Year’s Eve. If the EU is confident in this proposal, it must hold a public consultation.” The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through “delegated acts” – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. The plans have already attracted the ire of Greta Thunberg and other young climate activists, who say this “fake climate action” contradicts the EU’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

Russia’s ministry of defence admitted its soldiers had retreated. They had been “withdrawn to more advantageous lines”, the ministry said, after their encirclement by Ukrainian forces. The defeat is an embarrassment for Vladimir Putin, who declared on Friday that the city – in the Donetsk region – was Russia’s “for ever”. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, made a surprise visit to Ukraine – her first since Russia’s invasion in February – as Kyiv urged Berlin to send it battle tanks. Lambrecht visited the southern port city of Odesa on Saturday and met her Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, the German defence ministry said. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is no longer leaking under the Baltic Sea because an equilibrium has been reached between the gas and water pressure, pipeline spokesman Ulrich Lissek told AFP. The British prime minster, Liz Truss, has said the series of explosions that severely damaged Russia’s gas pipelines were an act of sabotage. Belarus is preparing to receive Russian soldiers and equipment, the Kyiv Independent reports. There are about 1,000 Russian soldiers in the country. Ukraine’s ambassador to Canada said her country held Russia to account for violating Ukraine’s sovereign airspace by bombing airports, which goes against the 1944 agreement setting out core principles for global aviation. Yuliya Kovaliv told Reuters it was important that all members of the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) addressed “such a drastic breach of the Chicago convention”. Russia failed to win enough votes for re-election to the ICAO’s governing council. The French representative told the assembly after Saturday’s ballot: “When we have votes in our countries, if we don’t like the result, we don’t ask for another vote.” Russia had a place on the UN aviation agency’s 36-member council as one of the “states of chief importance in air transport”. The head of Russia’s region of Chechnya said Moscow should consider using a low-yield nuclear weapon in Ukraine after its battlefield defeat in Lyman. Ramzan Kadyrov said in a message on Telegram addressing Russia’s loss of its stronghold: “In my personal opinion, more drastic measures should be taken, right up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons.” A superyacht built for an oligarch under sanctions is being discreetly offered for sale for £26m ($29m), with buyers advised that any viewings will be in the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. Brokers are being warned that the sale of MySky, built for Igor Kesaev – sanctioned over the supply of weapons to the Russian army – should not be advertised online. Russia has accused the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, of violating the game’s principles by suggesting that Russian athletes might be allowed to return to competition provided they did not support the invasion of Ukraine. Bach told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera: “This war has not been started by the Russian athletes.” Russian authorities informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that the head of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was “temporarily detained” for questioning. Ihor Murashov was detained on his way from the Russian-occupied plant – Europe’s largest – to the town of Enerhodar at about 4pm on Friday. Russia is trying to transfer the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Russian energy firm Rosatom, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, Petro Kotin, has told the BBC. Kharkiv oblast’s governor said Ukrainian authorities found the bodies of at least 20 people in a civilian convoy near the city of Kupiansk. Oleh Syniehubov believed they were killed while they attempted to flee Russian soldiers, according to the Kyiv Independent.

It’s that wind that has made it a prized site for renewable energy projects. The northern inland New South Wales town is in the southernmost lobe of the New England Renewable Energy Zone (Rez), the northernmost of the five zones set up by the NSW government to cluster new wind and solar projects together for ease of storage and transmission. One project in development to make use of all that Walcha wind is the Winterbourne windfarm, the majority stakeholder of which is Danish renewable energy company Vestas. The project has been in development since 2004 and the company says it hopes to start building in 2024. The proposal involves building “up to 119” turbines with a maximum blade tip height of 230 metres across the north and east of the town. The proponents of the project say the turbines will be a boon to the region and its people, while opponents say it’s a risk to tourism, biodiversity and the town’s aesthetics. It’s a familiar argument, repeated up and down the east coast under a wave of new windfarm developments. Among the most vocal detractors is the former National party leader and New England MP, Barnaby Joyce, who has argued that the region should instead work to extend the life of its existing coal power stations until new nuclear technology is available. Joyce has found himself on the same side of at least some of the arguments with treechangers and local conservationists, concerned about the environmental impact of the proposed windfarm, and on the opposite side to a number of local farmers who see themselves on the frontline of climate change. ‘We need to diversify’ The Fletchers are one of the families willing to speak out in favour of Winterbourne. The land that’s been in their family since 1863 is slated to host some of the turbines. Warwick Fletcher, who runs sheep and cattle, sees it as a chance for Walcha to be at the forefront of renewable energy development. It is a win-win for farmers, he says: the royalties from hosting turbines will be a stable income stream; and the switch to renewables will lessen the impact of the climate crisis. “Our production is governed by rain,” Fletcher says. “We’ve had years where we had negative returns on assets, year in, year out. Everybody keeps telling us we can’t afford to rely on handouts – we need to diversify.” Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter For Warwick’s daughter, Holly, it is about future-proofing the farm. “We know the effects of climate change are real,” she says. “The people in the bush experience it more than anyone else in the country.” Walcha’s population of just over 3,000 is ageing. With younger workers forced to move away for employment, there’s less money in the town and fewer reasons to stay. The project comes with the promise of a $1m community development fund, with an additional $750,000 a year once the generators are turned on and a further $1,000 for every megawatt generated over 600MW. With a projected output of 700MW, that’s up to $850,000 a year for a town that sorely needs investment. Vestas also says the project will create up to 400 jobs during construction and 16 maintenance jobs once operational. The town needs the money. “The inequality [in Walcha] is incredible,” Fletcher says. It’s not the only project in the area: the first stage of the 720MW New England solar farm at Uralla, 40km from Walcha, opened on Wednesday. Other communities are cashing in. Fletcher is frustrated that Joyce, his local MP, and the National party, aren’t backing a project that is offering that level of financial support. “How many Nationals in federal parliament?” Fletcher says. “There’s going to be less and less people in the bush to vote for them.” An unlikely alliance of opponents Most of the opponents to the windfarm are concerned about the impact it may have on threatened species, as well as concerns about construction, turbine height, end-of-life of disposal of blades, noise, and the appropriateness of the community consultation. Others, like Barnaby Joyce, just oppose windfarms in general. Rachel and Cameron Greig are members of Voice For Walcha and are concerned about its proximity to Oxley Wild Rivers national park. “Winterbourne’s [environmental impact statement] describes the concentration as 0.66 wedgetail eagles per hectare per hour,” Rachel says. “At any other windfarm that they’ve got this measured for it goes from 0.11 to 0.44,” she says. “So it’s really one-and-a-half times higher than any other windfarms that they’ve mentioned. Wedgies get killed at these windfarms.” Most of their concerns come directly from the Winterbourne proposal documents. The EIS states the project will also “result in the loss of up to 206.73 hectares of potential habitat” for koalas and “a significant residual impact is considered likely”. The total cost of required environmental offsets will be $64.3m, the EIS states. The total cost of the project, Vestas says, will be $1.9bn. “It’s going to lead to loss of habitat to threatened species, including koalas, quolls and gliders,” Rachel Greig says. Cameron Greig argues that placing the turbines at the edge of the national park could potentially create an issue for aerial firefighting, by obstructing the bombers. “With turbines against that area, they’ve lost a pretty crucial tool to get control of those areas – in a smoky environment or in low cloud, those areas just become no-fly zones,” he says. The Rural Fire Service told Guardian Australia that wind turbines could be negotiated like any other obstacle. “Wind turbines are treated in the same way as other hazards across the landscape, such as power lines, radio or television transmission towers and mountains, all of which need to be taken into account in mission planning and by individual pilots,” a spokesperson said. Both Joyce, who has a property at nearby Woolbrook, and the National party state member for Northern Tablelands, Adam Marshall, attended a Voice for Walcha meeting in January in opposition to the project. Walcha was previously in the state electorate for Tamworth, but will fall under Northern Tablelands in the redrawn electoral boundaries for the 25 March poll. Marshall told the gathering the proposal contained “the very worst EIS I have ever, ever seen”. Joyce repeated calls for nuclear reactors to replace ageing coal-fired generators, instead of wind, and asked locals to march on Canberra. “I’m gonna tell you one thing: the [wind turbine] technology will be so out of date, it will be ridiculous. It will be antiquated,” Joyce told the crowd at the Walcha Bowling Club. “Personally, I believe that nuclear power will be in, and it’ll be something that would fit in this room that will do the job of thousands of wind turbines.” In a statement to Guardian Australia, Vestas says the company recognises “that change can be difficult and the transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy involves regional areas like Walcha”. It says it remains committed to engaging with the community openly and transparently. The Walcha mayor, Eric Noakes, says the council has taken a “neutral stance” on the project, with “councillors for it, councillors against it”. Noakes says the project has been “divisive” and he hopes the fault lines don’t run too deep. “We’ve always been a tight community – we’ve got to be a tight community to survive the tough times,” he says. “We’ll need our resilience as a community again one day.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2022/may/27/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-27T20:00:12Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/27/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/may/27/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A feature about nuclear energy stated incorrectly that there had been an estimated 10,000 deaths from all causes related to the Fukushima disaster, including 1,500 from cancer.

Thank you for following our coverage. Here is a roundup of what we know on day 277 of the invasion. And a young couple’s account of helping citizens and Kyiv’s army during the Russian onslaught in Kherson. Hundreds of Ukrainians streamed out of Kherson city on Sunday to flee Russian shelling, two weeks after its recapture from Russian occupying forces prompted jubilant celebrations. The liberation of Kherson marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv – reconquered after the Russians retreated to the east bank of the Dnipro River. However, since then inhabitants have struggled with no water, heating and electricity, because Moscow’s troops destroyed thermal and power plants before they left. Evacuations began last week amid fears that damage to infrastructure caused by the war was too severe for people to endure over Ukraine’s harsh winter. The exodus has been exacerbated by Russian shelling, which has killed 32 civilians since Russian forces left the city on 9 November. “It is sad that we are leaving our home,” Yevhen Yankov told the Associated Press as a van he was in inched forward. “Now we are free, but we have to leave, because there is shelling, and there are dead among the population.” Ukraine only has enough power to cover 80% of its electricity needs, according to the country’s state grid operator Ukrenergo. It comes after Russia’s seventh attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure as part of a new strategy. Here’s a quick look at the latest news at it approaches 6pm in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm said on Sunday there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which they seized in March soon after their invasion. “One gets the impression they’re packing their bags and stealing everything they can,” Petro Kotin, head of Energoatom, said on national television. The UK Ministry of Defence has confirmed that as part of its aid package, the UK has provided Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to the Ukrainian armed forces. “This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” it said. The Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, was on the second day of an unannounced visit to Ukraine on Sunday. Accompanied by the Belgian foreign minister, Hadja Lahbib, De Croo used the visit to announce additional Belgian support of around €37.4m. Russian forces have suffered heavy casualties during fighting in Ukraine’s south-central Donetsk province and are unlikely to achieve a breakthrough there, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian airstrikes of the war. Russia kept up its onslaught on Ukrainian cities on Saturday with an attack on Dnipro which injured six people and destroyed seven houses, said the regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko. Thirty-two civilians have been killed in Kherson since 9 November, when Russian forces withdrew from the southern city they had occupied for eight months, the Kyiv Independent quoted Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, as saying. Since then, Russian troops have shelled Kherson frequently. Ukraine accused the Kremlin of reviving the “genocidal” tactics of Joseph Stalin as Kyiv commemorated a Soviet-era famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the winter of 1932-33. Volodymyr Zelenskiy hosted a summit in Kyiv with allied nations on Saturday to launch a “grain from Ukraine” initiative to export $150m worth of grain to countries most vulnerable to famine and drought. Up to 60 Ukrainian grain ships could be sent by the middle of next year to some of the world’s poorest countries in Africa, the Ukrainian president has said in a statement released to the Guardian. Belarus’s long-time foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, has “passed away suddenly”, the Belarusian state-run news agency Belta reported, without giving further detail. Belarus has been an ally of Russia and a base over the border for the invasion of Ukraine. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova posted on her Telegram channel that “we are shocked by the reports of the death”. Makei had been due to meet Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Minsk on Monday. The prime ministers of Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine – Ingrida Šimonytė, Mateusz Morawiecki and Denys Shmyhal, respectively – met in Kyiv on Saturday for talks to discuss and reiterate their commitment to work together “in countering Russia’s armed aggression”. Russia is firing ageing cruise missiles stripped of their nuclear warheads at Ukrainian targets because Vladimir Putin’s stocks are so depleted, the UK Ministry of Defence has suggested. An intelligence update from the ministry on Saturday said the desperate improvisation by the Russian president’s struggling forces were “unlikely to achieve reliable effects”. The head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm said on Sunday there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which they seized in March soon after their invasion, Reuters reports. Such a move would be a major battlefield change in the partially-occupied south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region where the frontline has hardly shifted for months. Repeated shelling around the plant has spurred fears of a nuclear catastrophe. “In recent weeks we are effectively receiving information that signs have appeared that they are possibly preparing to leave the [plant],” Petro Kotin, head of Energoatom, said on national television. “Firstly, there are a very large number of reports in Russian media that it would be worth vacating the [plant] and maybe worth handing control [of it)] to the [International Atomic Energy Agency],” he said, referring to the United Nations nuclear watchdog. “One gets the impression they’re packing their bags and stealing everything they can.” Russia and Ukraine, which was the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident in Chornobyl in 1986, have for months repeatedly accused each other of shelling the Zaporizhzhia reactor complex, which is no longer generating energy. Asked if it was too early to talk about Russian troops leaving the plant, Kotin said on television: “It’s too early. We don’t see this now, but they are preparing [to leave].” “All of the [Ukrainian] personnel are forbidden to pass checkpoints and travel to Ukrainian[-controlled] territory.” The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has likened Russia’s tactics in Ukraine to the Holodomor, a man-made famine engineered by Joseph Stalin that led to the deaths of millions of Ukrainians. Saturday was Holodomor Remembrance Day. The UK Ministry of Defence has confirmed that as part of its aid package, the UK has provided Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to the Ukrainian armed forces. ”This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” it said. My colleague Dalya Alberge has a story of a film studio that had to help the artists working out of its Kyiv branch flee the country when Russia invaded. The Kremlin has sought to play down reports that a Russian-led security alliance of former Soviet countries is weakening in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, called into question the effectiveness of the six-nation Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) at a summit this week. During a “family” photograph of leaders of countries in the CSTO in Yerevan on Wednesday, Pashinyan stepped away from Putin, who had been standing to his left. Pashinyan then refused to sign a summit declaration, as he railed against the recent failures of the CSTO, which ties Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan into a mutual defence agreement. Armenia’s criticism follows comments from Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, at the UN general assembly in September during which he implicitly criticised Russia’s war in Ukraine. On Sunday, Reuters reported that Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had said attempts to break up CSTO had always existed and would continue to do so, but insisted that the alliance remained in high demand despite criticism this week from Armenia. “There have always been attempts to [bring about] the CSTO’s disintegration,” news agencies quoted Peskov as saying in an interview broadcast on state television. “But at least now we see that, despite all the difficulties, despite the possible contradictions even between member countries, this structure remains in high demand,” he said. “And it fully demonstrated its relevance and effectiveness, meaning the resolution of the situation in Kazakhstan.” Russia, the dominant player in the CSTO, risks losing influence in parts of the former Soviet Union that it has long seen as its sphere of influence, as the conflict in Ukraine drags into its 10th month. The retired Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly, who embarked on the longest single space flight by an American, has visited Ukraine. Kelly, 58, a veteran of four space flights, visited the Okhmatdyt specialised children’s hospital. Some shocking images of the destroyed Antonivsky Bridge in Kherson have been published by AP photographer Bernat Armangué. The bridge, the main crossing point over the Dnipro River in Kherson, was destroyed by Russian troops earlier in November, after Kremlin forces withdrew from the southern city. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Russian army of deliberately destroying critical infrastructure during their withdrawal from the city, including electricity and water supplies. Ukrainian troops entered Kherson on 11 November after the Russian army had withdrawn from the city, which they captured in the early stage of the conflict, shortly after Russian troops had entered Ukraine in February 2022. The Associated Press news agency has filed this update on the ongoing shelling by Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine overnight. With persistent snowfall blanketing the capital, Kyiv on Sunday, analysts predicted that wintry weather — bringing with it frozen terrain and gruelling fighting conditions — could have an increasing impact on the direction of the conflict that has raged since Russian forces invaded Ukraine more than nine months ago. But for the moment, both sides were bogged down by heavy rain and muddy battlefield conditions in some areas, experts said. After a blistering barrage of Russian artillery strikes on at least two occasions over the past two weeks, infrastructure teams in Ukraine were fanning out in around-the-clock deployments to restore key basic services as many Ukrainians dealt with only a few hours of electricity per day — if any. Ukrenergo, the state power grid operator, said on Sunday that electricity producers are now supplying about 80% of demand. That’s an improvement from Saturday’s 75%, the company says. In the eastern Donetsk region, five people were killed in shelling over the past day, according to governor Pavlo Kyrylenko. Overnight shelling was reported by regional leaders in the Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk areas to the west. Kharkiv governor Oleh Syniehubov said one person was killed and three wounded in the northeastern region. The Belgium prime minister, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, is on the second day of an unannounced visit to Ukraine. Accompanied by Belgian foreign minister, Hadja Lahbib, De Croo used the visit to announce additional Belgian support of around 37.4 million euros. De Croo has been visiting different parts of the country including Bucha, where in April almost 500 bodies of residents were discovered in the streets of the city, victims of the Bucha massacre, the mass murder of Ukrainian civilians by Russian Armed Forces. The Belgian PM also visited Borodianka in Kyiv Oblast and was photographed standing in front of a recent Banksy mural, showing a small boy throwing a man, thought to represent Russian president Vladimir Putin, in judo attire over his shoulder. Most of the buildings in Borodianka, a small town on an important access road to Kyiv, have been destroyed by Russian bombings in the first months of the Russian invasion. Ukraine should take responsibility for any legal action against Russia because the West could “corrupt the process” for “cheap gas and oil”, a former international criminal prosecutor has told the Sunday Telegraph. Prof Sir Geoffrey Nice KC was the lead prosecutor against Slobodan Milosevic, the former president of Serbia, at the UN’s Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia between 1998 and 2006. He has been visiting Kyiv in recent months to discuss how perpetrators of potential war crimes might be held to account. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, he warned that “there are real risks of it subcontracting out” any legal action to the international community, saying it may end up with Crimea and the Donbas being sacrificed for a peace deal in exchange “for cheap oil and gas” for the West. He warned that foreign powers could pressure Ukraine into accepting “a negotiated settlement” that could compromise the Donbas and Crimea - Ukrainian regions invaded by Russia. Karim Ahmad Khan KC, the British barrister who serves as International Criminal Court’s (ICC) chief prosecutor, launched an investigation into alleged war crimes in Ukraine in March. But there has been no meaningful update since then. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has posted a message of support for Ukraine this morning on his official Twitter account, accompanied with a video narrated by Ukrainian voices. I believe in freedom. I believe we should stand up for the fundamental rights that matter so much to us all. For our sovereignty, for our self determination and for the foundations of a stable international order we are all fighting to restore. The Ukrainian people face bombing in the day and blackouts at night. But we know our friends will always be there to help see us through. The UK is one of our most steadfast allies. They give weapons for our battle, kit to keep us warm and friendship to restore our spirits. We know they will never let us down as we fight to win this war. With your help, we will secure our freedom. Together we will never back down, together we will be strong, together we will protect Ukraine and the freedoms we all cherish so much. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has warned rape in war violates international values as severely as the use of chemical weapons. Speaking to the Sunday Times on the eve of hosting a major international conference on preventing sexual violence in conflict in London, Cleverly said the “abhorrent act” is being used in Ukraine and other parts of the world. “This is an absolutely abhorrent act and yet we are seeing in Ukraine and other parts of world this is still being used as a weapon of war. We need to make sure that military commanders understand that it is just as unacceptable as the use of chemical weapons or as the killing or abuse of prisoners of war,” he said. Cleverly said he was horrified when he met victims in Yemen and Iraq as a junior foreign office minister two years ago. “It’s harrowing and now I ‘hear similar stories coming out from Ukraine and it never gets less painful,” he said. He had a chance to hear testimony first-hand in Ukraine where he spent two days seeing the missile damage that has left much of the country, including the British embassy, without power and water. More than 50 ministers from around the world are flying in, as well as 50 survivors from 20 countries from Colombia to South Sudan, including the Nobel peace prize winner Nadia Murad, a young Yazidi woman who has become a powerful advocate after being held as a sex slave by Islamic State fighters. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed on Saturday that Ukraine would continue to resist Russian attacks, as the country marked the 90th anniversary of the Holodomor famine that affected millions of Ukrainians under Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Agence France-Presse reported that several European leaders travelled to Ukraine to pledge support after weeks of Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy grid caused widespread power and water cuts as temperatures plunge with the onset of winter. Zelensky said in a video posted on social media: Once they wanted to destroy us with hunger, now – with darkness and cold. We cannot be broken. Leaders from Belgium, Lithuania and Poland were in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Saturday to commemorate victims of the 1932-33 Holodomor – Ukrainian for “death by starvation” – regarded by Kyiv as a deliberate act of genocide by Stalin’s regime. The Polish and Lithuanian prime ministers were also in Ukraine for talks that, according to local media, could focus on a possible new wave of migration from Ukraine this winter. The Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, paid his respects at a Holodomor memorial in Kyiv during his first visit to the country since Russia invaded. He posted photos on Twitter of him shaking hands with Zelenskiy, writing: Arrived in Kyiv. After the heavy bombing of recent days, we stand with the people of Ukraine. More than ever before. Belgium pledged a further €37.4m ($39m) of financial aid for Ukraine, the Belga news agency reported. Russian forces have suffered heavy casualties during fighting in Ukraine’s south-central Donetsk province and are unlikely to achieve a breakthrough there, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Its latest intelligence update said the area around the towns of Pavlivka and Vuhledar, in Ukraine’s east, had seen “intense combat” in the past two weeks but that little territory had changed hands. The ministry tweeted: Both Russia and Ukraine have significant forces committed to this sector, with Russian naval infantry having suffered heavy casualties. This area remains heavily contested, likely partially because Russia assesses the area has potential as a launch point for a future major advance north to capture the remainder of Ukrainian-held Donetsk Oblast. However, Russia is unlikely to be able to concentrate sufficient quality forces to achieve an operational breakthrough. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, have both announced new financial aid packages to support Ukrainian grain exports, which have been disrupted by the war. Macron said in a video statement: The most vulnerable countries must not pay the price of a war they did not want. Agence France-Presse also reported that the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, vowed the EU would continue to support Ukraine, accusing Russia of using “food as a weapon”. Heavy snowfall was expected in Kyiv starting on Sunday, with temperatures dropping below freezing day and night, while millions of people who still live in and around the Ukrainian capital remain with little electricity and heat. Reuters reported grid operator Ukrenergo as saying on Saturday that electricity producers were able to cover only three-quarters of consumption needs, necessitating restrictions and blackouts across the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said there were restrictions on the use of electricity in 14 of Ukraine’s 27 regions and in Kyiv, for “more than 100,000” customers in each of the regions. He said in his nightly video address: If consumption increases in the evening, the number of outages may increase. This once again shows how important it is now to save power and consume it rationally. Sergey Kovalenko, chief operating officer of Yasno, which provides energy to Kyiv, said the situation in the city had improved but remained “quite difficult.” He indicated residents should have at least four hours of power a day. Ukrainians have streamed out of Kherson to flee Russian shelling, just weeks after celebrating Ukraine’s recapture of the southern city. Associated Press reported that a line of trucks, vans and cars – some towing trailers or ferrying out pets and other belongings – stretched a kilometre or more on the outskirts of Kherson on Saturday. Days of intensive shelling by Russian forces prompted a bittersweet exodus: many civilians were happy that their city had been won back but lamented that they couldn’t stay. “It is sad that we are leaving our home,” said Yevhen Yankov, as a van he was in inched forward. Now we are free, but we have to leave, because there is shelling, and there are dead among the population. Poking her head out from the back, Svitlana Romanivna added: We went through real hell. Our neighborhood was burning, it was a nightmare. Everything was in flames. Emilie Fourrey, emergency project coordinator for aid group Doctors Without Borders in Ukraine, said an evacuation of 400 patients of Kherson’s psychiatric hospital, which is situated near both an electrical plant and the frontline, had begun on Thursday and was set to continue in the coming days. Russia has ratcheted up its attacks on critical infrastructure after suffering battlefield setbacks. A prominent Russian nationalist said Saturday that the Russian military didn’t have enough doctors – a rare public admission of problems within the military. Hello and welcome back to our ongoing live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Here’s a quick look at the latest news at it approaches 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. There are growing fears Russia’s relentless targeting of Ukraine’s electricity grid will threaten the safety of the country’s nuclear power plants, in the wake of the unprecedented emergency shutdown on Wednesday. Petro Kotin, the president of Ukraine’s nuclear power company, Energoatom, said all safety mechanisms had worked as intended on Wednesday but two generators were damaged in the process. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian air strikes of the war. Russia kept up its onslaught on Ukrainian cities on Saturday with an attack on Dnipro which injured six people and destroyed seven houses, said the regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko.

The attacks struck a wide arc of targets including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, reported five people had been killed in a strike on the Zolochiv district. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, said two women in their 70s had been injured by a strike on Pisochyn. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, reported that three people were killed in the southern city of Kherson. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes as without military purpose and “just Russian barbarism”. The strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for ten days,” the company said in a statement. In a statement, Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the site’s safety and security. He said: “This is the sixth time that the plant has lost all off-site power and has had to operate in this emergency mode. Each time we are rolling a dice, and if we allow this to continue then one day our luck will run out.” Zelenskiy has said he will not meet Vladimir Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraine’s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet Putin, Zelenskiy said: “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word” and “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that.” Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia was among the countries that had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistria’s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. The Kremlin said on Thursday it doubted the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have been carried out without state support, after the New York Times reported that a pro-Ukrainian non-government group might have been responsible for the blasts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was vital to identify who was behind the attacks which ruptured the multi-billion dollar pipelines last September. He added that it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. Ukraine will take part in European Union countries’ scheme to jointly buy gas, the bloc’s energy policy chief said on Thursday. Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the country’s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter. The city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s east, could fall in the next few days, said the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. “What we see is that Russia is throwing more troops, more forces and what Russia lacks in quality they try to make up in quantity. They have suffered big losses, but at the same time, we cannot rule out that Bakhmut may eventually fall in the coming days,” he said on Wednesday. The founder of the mercenary Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, which has been leading the Russian assault on Bakhmut, said on Wednesday Russian forces now fully control the east of the city. The claims have not been independently verified. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in its Wednesday morning report: “The enemy, despite significant losses, continues to storm the town of Bakhmut.” Russia is unlikely to capture significantly more territory this year, according to the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines. She told a Senate hearing on Wednesday that the military will probably be unable to carry on its current level of fighting, even with the possible capture of Bakhmut. The Pentagon has been accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The defence department is said to be firmly opposed to using The Hague-based ICC, as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers. Zelenskiy has invited the US House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyiv’s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelenskiy proposed the visit in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. The US obtained a warrant to seize a Boeing aircraft owned by Russian oil company Rosneft that is valued at over $25m (£21m), the US justice department said. The district court for the eastern district of New York authorised the seizure, based on violations of export controls and sanctions against Russia, the department said. In a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Wednesday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, told journalists it was “critical” that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed, with Ukraine traditionally being one of the world’s largest exporters of grain. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. The Kremlin, however, said on Thursday there were still “a lot of questions” remaining over the deal, and that there were currently no plans for a direct meeting with Guterres. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Wednesday he had suggested the bloc spend €1bn (£890m) for the joint procurement of ammunition for Ukraine and to refill their own stockpiles. “I propose to mobilise another €1bn,” Reuters reported he told the media after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Stockholm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/13/aukus-10-things-we-need-to-know-about-australias-nuclear-submarine-program","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-13T04:51:36Z","webTitle":"Aukus: 10 things we need to know about Australia’s nuclear submarine program","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/13/aukus-10-things-we-need-to-know-about-australias-nuclear-submarine-program","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/13/aukus-10-things-we-need-to-know-about-australias-nuclear-submarine-program","fields":{"headline":"Aukus: 10 things we need to know about Australia’s nuclear submarine program","bodyText":"The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is preparing to make the most significant announcement since he took office, joining the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US president, Joe Biden, to unveil the multi-decade Aukus submarine plan on Tuesday morning AEDT. For now, many questions remain unanswered. Here are some of the main ones to look out for on Tuesday. 1. How much will this cost? Will Australian taxpayers be on the hook to subsidise the expansion of the US production line? And how on earth will we pay for it all? None of this will be cheap. Previous non-government estimates have put the long-term submarine program cost at anywhere between $116bn and $171bn, although these numbers were crunched before the full details were known. In an interview with Guardian Australia in January, the defence minister, Richard Marles, also did not rule out Australian taxpayers subsidising the expansion of US production prior to South Australian shipbuilding being ready to ramp up domestic production. This all comes at a time when the Australian government’s budget is already under pressure from competing and growing demands on a range of fronts – and when the Coalition is opposing modest savings. 2. How will we build up the nuclear expertise and other associated jobs to make this project work? Will the Royal Australian Navy recruit the crews needed to operate these larger submarines? The government estimates that Aukus will support some 20,000 jobs – including in the Australian Defence Force, the public service and private industry – over 30 years. This is meant to sound like a big win for Australia, but it also underlines the huge challenge looming to educate, train and recruit the specialists needed to make the plan a success. The Royal Australian Navy is expected to launch a recruitment drive soon, but it comes against a backdrop of pre-existing challenges. In a briefing to Marles last year, obtained under freedom of information laws, Defence warned: “The last year has seen lower recruiting achievement and higher separation rates, which have resulted in the ADF and [Department of Defence] workforce size being below approved levels.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup 3. Will it add a layer of unnecessary complexity for Australia to potentially operate two different types of nuclear-powered submarines at once? The Guardian reported last week that the long-term Aukus plan would likely involve a British submarine design with heavy use of American technology. But as an answer to the potential capability gap caused by the retirement of Australia’s existing Collins class conventional submarines from the late 2030s, Reuters reported Australia would buy three Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines from the US in the 2030s (with an option to buy two more). Some analysts have argued it will create complexity, duplication and cost for Australia to potentially run two classes of nuclear-powered submarines at once, so the government will be pressed to explain how these challenges can be met. 4. What are the plans for sovereign control and for how long will US or UK personnel and advisers have to travel on board the subs? The government – and the chief of its nuclear-powered submarine taskforce – have been unequivocal that Australian submarines will be under Australian command and control. But critics such as the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull have questioned whether this control will, in practice, be tempered by the need to continue to rely on US and UK personnel for technical and other support. V Adm Jonathan Mead acknowledged last week that Australia “will have assistance” and he likened this to other major defence programs, but added that the level of this assistance could reduce over time “as we develop more and more understanding of the technology”. Keep an eye out for what the government says on this point once the details are released. 5. Will the likely extended visits by US submarines to Australia in the meantime amount to a quasi-home-porting arrangement and how does that fit in with the prime minister’s assurances about maintaining sovereign control? Reuters reported that the US would forward-deploy some its own submarines in Western Australia by around 2027. The exact details of this arrangement between the Australian and US governments will be a key point of interest and Marles has previously played down the idea of “home-porting” foreign vessels in Australia. Canberra will likely argue the arrangement is no different from other rotational visits by US forces. 6. What assurances will the US give about loosening its export controls to actually make the Aukus plan work? Will Congress go along with it? Stringent export controls in the US have long been identified as a key obstacle to making Aukus work – including in the second pillar, the push to collaborate on other advanced military technologies not just submarines. On the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday, Joe Courtney – one of the biggest supporters of Aukus in the US Congress – expressed confidence the export controls issues could be resolved with a carveout similar to the one enjoyed by Canada. 7. When and how will construction begin on the first South Australian-built submarines and does that mean any slippage in political commitments that were made to that state? This will be a politically important issue for South Australia. When Aukus was first unveiled in 2021, the Morrison government said its intention was to build at least eight nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. Labor reaffirmed that intention and the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has been seeking assurances. But the timeframe for that work starting will be of interest, given that it seems an “off-the-shelf” solution has been found to plug the capability gap. 8. How will the three countries defend the nuclear non-proliferation precedent set by the deal and will any special arrangements be put in place to reassure the region? This is going to be a critical issue, given that China has been seeking to portray the arrangement as not in keeping with the spirit of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and Indonesia and Malaysia have previously expressed concerns. The significance of the deal is that two nuclear-weapons states will be handing nuclear tech to a non-nuclear-weapons state – and some experts have raised concerns about the precedent this may set for others. Australia is firm in declaring that it is only seeking nuclear-propelled (not nuclear-armed) submarines and that the NPT does not prohibit naval nuclear propulsion. Australia is in contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency and has promised to “implement the most stringent of security protocols”. The details, however, will be important. 9. What will happen to the nuclear waste when the submarines retire from service? The government says the reactor technology “means that future nuclear-powered submarines will not require refuelling during the service life of the boat, therefore Australia will not require a civil nuclear power industry”. But we just don’t know yet what the plans are for what happens to the nuclear waste at the end of the process. 10. How does the plan fit with future technological developments? Could they be more easily detectible by the time the new subs hit the water? The Australian National University’s National Security College report Transparent Oceans? found that scientific and technological advancements could make it increasingly difficult to hide the presence of submarines and predicted oceans were “likely” or “very likely” to become transparent by the 2050s. This does tend to raise some questions about the comparative benefits of nuclear-powered submarines to avoid detection – although Mead says the issue has been taken into account and that the subs could serve as a base from which uncrewed underwater vehicle operate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/war-in-ukraine-what-we-know-on-day-nine-of-the-russian-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T14:59:59Z","webTitle":"War in Ukraine: what we know on day nine of the Russian invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/war-in-ukraine-what-we-know-on-day-nine-of-the-russian-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/war-in-ukraine-what-we-know-on-day-nine-of-the-russian-invasion","fields":{"headline":"War in Ukraine: what we know on day nine of the Russian invasion","bodyText":"Russian troops have seized Europe’s largest nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia after a fire sparked by heavy shelling, Ukrainian authorities said. No changes in radiation had been recorded but any loss of ability to cool nuclear fuel would lead to “significant radioactive emissions” that could “outgrow all previous nuclear power plant accidents”, they said. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, offered to travel to Ukraine to facilitate talks with Russia aimed at guaranteeing the safety of nuclear plants during the conflict. The situation “continues to be extremely tense and challenging,” he said. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has warned the days to come are “likely to be worse”, calling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades”. But he stressed Nato was a “defensive alliance” and not seeking a war with Russia. Stoltenberg said foreign ministers discussed a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine but agreed that Nato planes should not operate over Ukrainian airspace. He also said Nato had evidence Russia was using cluster bombs. In a call with Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin dismissed as “propaganda fakes” reports of missile strikes on large cities. He said Russia was open to dialogue but only if its demands – the neutral, non-nuclear status of Ukraine, its “denazification”, recognition of Crimea as Russian and the “sovereignty” of separatist territories in eastern Ukraine – were met. Putin, also warned Russia’s neighbours “not to escalate the situation” by imposing more restrictions on his country, adding: “There are no bad intentions towards our neighbours … We fulfil all our obligations and will continue to fulfil them.” Russian forces intensified their bombardment of cities in eastern and southern Ukraine after taking control of Kherson on Thursday, causing devastating damage. Mariupol remains encircled, Russian soldiers entered Mykolayiv, and Kharkiv, the country’s secojnd city, was again heavily shelled. US secretary of state Anthony Blinken said Washington was “committed to doing everything we can to make this stop”, adding that the west was “faced together with what is President Putin’s war of choice: unprovoked, unjustified, and a war that is having horrific, horrific consequences for real people.” More than 1.2m people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February, the UN said, including about half a million children. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed directly to Russians to protest over the seizure of nuclear power infrastructure by Russian troops. “Russian people, I want to appeal to you: how is this possible?” he said. “After all, we fought together in 1986 against the Chernobyl catastrophe.” Zelenskiy earlier accused Russia of “nuclear terror”, as British PM Boris Johnson said Putin’s forces were “reckless”. US president Joe Biden and Canada’s Justin Trudeau also condemned Russia for shelling the plant. Russia’s defence ministry blamed the attack on the nuclear plant on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a “monstrous provocation”. Ukraine and Russia agreed to try to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks on Thursday, but with no plans for how they might be implemented. A third round is set to take place next week. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russians to rally around their president and said that what happened next would depend on Kyiv’s stance in talks, adding that Russia had “clearly conveyed to the Ukrainian side our vision of solving this problem”. The UN Human Rights Council overwhelmingly voted to create a top-level investigation into violations committed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with 32 members of the 47-seat council in favour and only Russia and Eritrea voting against. Russia’s parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” information about the armed forces. Russia admitted to “limiting” access to news websites including the BBC, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the independent Russian site Meduza and Germany’s Deutsche Welle, with Facebook also blocked."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/feb/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-moscow-row-over-crimes-against-humanity-claims","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-19T19:31:37Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: shelling kills three in southern city of Berislav – as it happened ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/feb/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-moscow-row-over-crimes-against-humanity-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/feb/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-moscow-row-over-crimes-against-humanity-claims","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: shelling kills three in southern city of Berislav – as it happened ","bodyText":"We are now closing the blog. Here’s a summary of today’s events: Three people were killed by shelling near the southern Ukrainian city of Berislav on Sunday morning, according to local officials. The regional military administration said Russian forces struck the village of Burgunka with “massive artillery fire” and that one of the shells hit the yard of a family home. Ukrainian troops preparing for a Russian offensive in the eastern Donetsk region if the town of Bakhmut falls have described being outgunned and their fears of being “semi-encircled”. The state body that manages Ukraine’s nuclear power plants has said two missiles fired from the Black Sea on Saturday came “dangerously close” to hitting a plant in the Mykolaiv region. The US has said it believes China could be preparing to provide military aid to Russia, possibly including guns and other weapons. Russia has sustained almost 143,000 casualties since the beginning of the war, according to the latest figures from the Ukrainian military. The EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, has said the war could be over “in weeks” if the EU cannot increase its supply of ammunition to Ukraine. “We are in urgent war mode,” he said. “This shortage of ammunition has to be solved quickly.” France has said it would deliver the AMX-10 light armoured vehicles it has promised to Ukraine “by the end of next week”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also said in an interview that he wants Russia to lose the war but he does not want to see it “crushed”. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, will travel to Kyiv on Monday to meet with President Zelenskiy, according to reports. The amount of grain leaving Ukraine under a deal to keep food flowing to developing nations has dropped significantly in recent months, the body set up to monitor the shipments has said. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, rejected calls to supply Ukraine with cluster bombs, telling German media the military alliance “has neither recommended nor supplied these kinds of weapons.” The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said on Sunday he and President Joe Biden will discuss the possibility of increasing US troop presence in Poland and making it more permanent. The Biden administration is planning to impose new export controls and a fresh round of sanctions on Russia, targeting its defence and energy sectors, financial institutions and several individuals, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. The Ukraine war will have cost the German economy around €160bn (£142bn), or about 4% of its gross domestic output, in lost value creation by the end of the year, the head of the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) said. Russia said on Sunday that Ukraine was planning to stage a nuclear incident on its territory to pin the blame on Moscow before a United Nations meeting, without providing evidence for the accusation. Suggestions by senior Ukrainian government ministers that the country’s military should be provided with cluster munitions received a cool reception among western allies at the Munich security conference. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, rejected calls to supply Ukraine with cluster bombs, telling German media the military alliance “has neither recommended nor supplied these kinds of weapons”. Cluster munitions are a type of weapon that split open mid-air to release smaller explosives over a wide area. They can cause indiscriminate harm to civilians and have been banned under an international convention signed by more than 100 countries. On the sidelines of the conference, which concluded this afternoon, Ukraine’s calls for cluster munitions were widely discussed among attendees. For EU officials, however, the demand is particularly difficult since most European countries are parties to the convention. Asked at the conference about the calls for cluster munitions, Germany’s foreign affairs minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the country’s military support for Ukraine would be guided by the treaty. Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that within the German government “it is considered impossible that chancellor Olaf Scholz could allow something like this”. The reaction follows comments made by Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Olexander Kubrakov, who suggested Ukraine should be allowed to use cluster munitions on its territory. When asked about this on Saturday, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told reporters: “We understand that cluster ammunition is a debatable issue in world affairs. We are not party to the convention on the prohibition of cluster munitions. So legally there are no obstacles for that.” “If we receive one, we will be using it exclusively against military forces of the Russian Federation,” he added. Ukraine, like Russia and the US, has not joined the international convention on cluster munitions, which came into effect in 2010. The UN treaty prohibits under any circumstance the use, stockpiling, production or transfer of the weapons. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said on Sunday he and President Joe Biden will discuss the possibility of increasing US troop presence in Poland and making it more permanent. Biden will visit Poland over 20-22 February to mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. Morawiecki told CBS’s Face the Nation: We are in the process of discussion with president Biden’s administration about making their (troop) presence more permanent and increasing them. I’m very grateful also for sending new Patriot systems and other very modern weapons and munitions because this is also to some extent a proxy for presence of soldiers, but of course, the two go in tandem.” The US has about 11,000 personnel on rotation in Poland, according to CBS. Biden said last June the US would set up a new permanent army headquarters in Poland in response to Russian threats. He will meet the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, and eastern European allies but has no plans to cross into Ukraine, according to the White House. The Biden administration is planning to impose new export controls and a fresh round of sanctions on Russia, targeting key industries, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. The new sanctions will target Russia’s defence and energy sectors, financial institutions and several individuals, the report added. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, warned on the final day of the Munich security conference: Zelenskiy and the Ukrainians have a lot of applause and not enough ammunition. That’s the paradox. They need to be less applauded and better supplied with arms.” The Ukraine war will have cost the German economy around €160bn euros (£142bn), or about 4% of its gross domestic output, in lost value creation by the end of the year, the head of the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) said. That means GDP per capita in Europe’s largest economy will be €2,000 lower than it would otherwise have been, DIHK chief Peter Adrian told the Rheinische Post, Reuters reports. German industry is set to pay about 40% more for energy in 2023 than in 2021, before the crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February last year, a study by Allianz Trade said last month. “The growth outlook for 2023 and 2024 is therefore also lower than in many other countries,” Adrian said, adding that was also the case last year. Russia said on Sunday that Ukraine was planning to stage a nuclear incident on its territory to pin the blame on Moscow before a United Nations meeting, without providing evidence for the accusation. Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement that radioactive substances had been transported to Ukraine from a European country and Kyiv was preparing a large-scale “provocation”. “The aim of the provocation is to accuse Russia’s army of allegedly carrying out indiscriminate strikes on hazardous radioactive facilities in Ukraine, leading to the leakage of radioactive substances and contamination of the area,” it said. Ukraine and its allies have dismissed such accusations as cynical attempts to spread disinformation and accused Moscow of planning incidents itself in an attempt to blame Ukraine, Reuters reports. If you’re just joining us, here’s a quick round-up of all the latest from the war in Ukraine. Three people were killed by shelling near the southern Ukrainian city of Berislav on Sunday morning, according to local officials. The regional military administration said Russian forces struck the village of Burgunka with “massive artillery fire” and that one of the shells hit the yard of a family home. Ukrainian troops preparing for a Russian offensive in the eastern Donestk region if the town of Bakhmut falls have described being outgunned and fears of being “semi-encircled”.

The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, will travel to Kyiv on Monday to meet with President Zelensky, according to reports. The amount of grain leaving Ukraine under a deal to keep food flowing to developing nations has dropped significantly in recent months, the body set up to monitor the shipments has said. The oil company Shell and energy trader Vitol have been accused of prolonging the war in Ukraine by exploiting a “loophole” in the EU sanctions regime to bring products derived from Russian oil into Europe through Turkey. Oleg Ustenko, the economic adviser to President Zelenskiy, has urged the energy companies to commit to a deadline to halt the trade of a “Russian-origin oil products” to reduce Vladimir Putin’s war coffers, the Guardian has revealed. The EU implemented a ban on importing seaborne Russian crude oil on 5 December – the same day as a G7 price cap on Russian seaborne exports – and the ban was extended on 5 February to refined products such as diesel and fuel oil. But analysis of data from commodity tracker Kpler by the non-profit group Global Witness found that Shell had imported more than 600,000 barrels of refined products into the Netherlands from Turkish refineries known to import Russian oil since 5 December. Read the full story here: Ukrainian troops in the small town of Siversk have said they are preparing to defend one of the possible targets of the next Russian offensive. Siversk is just 21 miles north of the city of Bakhmut - scene of fierce fighting in recent weeks - and on a direct road to another of the key towns in the Donetsk region, Sloviansk. If Bakhmut falls, it is expected Russian forces would try to use it as a stepping stone to target Sloviansk as well as Kramatorsk, both larger cities. Speaking to Reuters, one soldier, 30-year-old Stefan, said the Soviet-era artillery with which Ukrainian forces were defending Siversk was being outgunned. “We have one artillery attack from our side, and the Russians can do it five times more,” he said. “It’s very difficult for the guys who are standing, especially at the first line [of defence], they feel it too much.” The deputy Siversk battalion commander, who used the nom-de-guerre “Han”, said the capture of Bakhmut by the Russians would leave his forces “semi-encircled”. “On the left side we have the Siverskyi Donets river, and the enemy will advance from the right, and it is possible to cut us off if they reach the Bakhmut highway,” he said. While capturing Bakhmut would be strategically useful to the Russians, Ukraine and its Western allies have said it would be a largely Pyrrhic victory, given the time taken and losses sustained. Some final pictures here from the last day of the Munich security conference, where discussion among world leaders has been dominated by the war in Ukraine. France is to begin delivering the armoured vehicles it has promised to Ukraine, the defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, said on Sunday. The vehicles, of the AMX-10 type and sometimes described as “light tanks”, are used for armed reconnaissance and attacks on enemy tanks. Their combat weight is 20 tonnes, around a third of that of France’s Leclerc battle tanks. Speaking to Le Parisien newspaper’s Sunday edition, Lecornu said that training of Ukrainian crews on the AMX-10 was “nearly complete” the first vehicles would be sent “by the end of next week”. He declined to specify the number of vehicles in the first batch, saying he did not want to give Russia any “strategic information”. President Emmanuel Macron promised in early January that France would provide the AMX-10s after months of hesitation over fears of escalating the conflict. The war in Ukraine will be over unless the EU finds a way in weeks to speed up the provision of ammunition, the EU foreign affairs chief has warned. Speaking on the final day of the Munich security conference, Josep Borrell said a special meeting of EU defence ministers slated for 8-9 March would provide a chance for countries to offer ammunition from their existing stocks. He added that it was taking up to 10 months for European armies to order and receive a single bullet. “We are in urgent war mode,” he said. “This shortage of ammunition has to be solved quickly; it is a matter of weeks.” Read the full story here: The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, will travel to Kyiv on Monday to meet President Zelenskiy, Reuters reports, citing a political source. Meloni, who took office in October, had said she planned to visit Kyiv before the 24 February anniversary of Russia’s invasion. Meloni, who heads the rightwing Brothers of Italy party, has been strongly supportive of Ukraine since taking office in October, but there are frictions over the issue within the coalition government that she leads. The former PM Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia party, last week said he would not seek a meeting with Zelenskiy if he were still head of government because he blames him for the war. The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, another of Forza Italia’s founders, said on Saturday he had met his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, on the sidelines of a G7 meeting at the Munich security conference to reassure him of Italy’s support. Italy and France have also recently finalised talks over delivery of an advanced air defence system to Kyiv in the spring. Former champion boxer Wladimir Klitschko has urged Ukraine’s allies to maintain their support for its resistance to the Russian invasion. Klitschko is the brother of Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, and since the war began has made frequent public appearances to rally support for his country. Speaking at a panel event on the final day of the Munich security conference, he said Ukraine was “completely depending” on “all the allies of the free world” and that it was “important to understand how much joy we have to live in a democracy”. “We talk about democracy but we don’t know what it feels like, and it’s so great,” he said. “So please keep on supporting us in Ukraine, because we are you. And you are us. It doesn’t matter what is in front of us - one of the strongest armies in the world, or weapons – our will is indestructible.” Gesturing to the people in the hall, he added: “Because it’s our will, of us, the free world.” The US has said it believes China may be about to provide lethal aid to help Russia in the war in Ukraine, prompting a direct warning against doing so from the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to China’s top diplomat. Blinken made the warning to the Chinese state councillor Wang Yi on Saturday evening at a blunt meeting on the sidelines of the Munich security conference. He also urged China to stop helping Russia evade the impact of sanctions. China’s trade with Russia is increasing and it has been buying Russian oil, but probably below the US$60 per barrel price cap imposed by the EU and G7 group of states. Speaking to CBS’s Face the Nation after he met with Wang, Blinken said: “We’ve made very clear to them that [providing lethal support] could cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship.” Read the full story here: Two Russian missiles fired on Saturday flew “dangerously close” to a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, the state body that runs the site has said. Energoatom, which manages the country’s nuclear plants, said that at 8.25 and 8.27am local time, two cruise missiles were recorded flying past the South Ukraine nuclear power plant. The plant sits in the Mykolaiv region around 80 miles north of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. Early on Saturday, Ukrainian military officials said that four Kalibr missiles had been launched from the Black Sea and that two had been intercepted by air defence systems. “The threat of hitting the reactor with possible consequences – a nuclear disaster – was again high,” Energoatom said. “This is another act of nuclear terrorism of the Russian Federation, which threatens the security of the whole world!” The body also appealed to the International Atomic Energy Authority to take “all possible measures to stop Russian nuclear terrorism” and to establish “a no-fly zone over all nuclear facilities of Ukraine”. Three people were killed by Russian shelling near the southern Ukrainian city of Berislav on Sunday morning, according to local officials. Posting on Telegram, the military administration in the Kherson region said Russian forces struck the village of Burgunka with “massive artillery fire”. It said one of the shells hit the yard of a family home and that at least three people – a father, mother and uncle – had been killed. It added that five people – a grandmother, a man, a 13-year-old boy, a 10-year-old girl, and an eight-year-old boy – were wounded. All the injured are said to have been taken to a medical facility and to be receiving treatment. “The enemy is targeting peaceful people!” the post said. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began a year ago this week, was an extraordinary and unexpected event that has changed the world in which we live. Long-held assumptions about peace in Europe, post-cold war relations with Moscow and Nato’s diminished standing were shattered overnight. The war has revolutionised German defence policy, silenced French talk of “strategic autonomy”, boosted EU unity, revived US commitment to the transatlantic alliance, dramatised the global north-south divide, reduced the UN to the role of hand-wringing bystander and given the UK an opportunity, after Brexit, to show it still has an international role to play. The fact the sovereign, democratic nation of Ukraine has survived, unbowed and unconquered, is possibly the most remarkable outcome of the conflict so far. And Ukraine’s physical survival, despite significant losses of territory, has been matched by psychological triumph. For this, much credit goes to its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has campaigned tirelessly to whip up international support. Gifts of weapons, cash aid, technology, expertise and shelter have poured in, along with volunteers, military and civilian. In contrast, morale among Russia’s army and public has slumped. But, and it’s a big “but”, it is plain the war is far from over and may be entering an even more dangerous phase. Read the Observer view on the war in Ukraine in full here: Russia is probably using balloons to gather information about Ukraine’s defence systems and force it to use up ammunition, according to UK intelligence. In its latest update, the Ministry of Defence said that, on 12 February, Ukraine’s air force reported sighting a number of balloons near the eastern city of Dnipro. Ukrainian armed forces also said that, on 15 February, they spotted and shot down several balloons over the capital, Kyiv. They also said the balloons had radar reflectors – devices that help radar systems detect small objects – suspended beneath them. “It is likely that the balloons were Russian,” the UK update said. “They likely represent a new tactic by Russia to gain information about Ukrainian air defence systems and compel the Ukrainians to expend valuable stocks of surface to air missiles and ammunition.” The amount of grain leaving Ukraine under a deal to keep food flowing to developing nations has dropped significantly, according to the body set up to monitor the shipments. The Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul, which comprises inspectors from the UN, Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey, said food exports from three Ukrainian ports have fallen from 3.7m metric tons in December to 3 million in January. It added that the number of average daily inspections fell to 5.7 last month, down from a peak of 10.6 in October. The drop in supply equates to about a month of food consumption for Kenya and Somalia combined. The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of deliberately delaying inspections of vessels to take “advantage of the opportunity of uninterrupted trade shipping” from its own ports on the Black Sea, a claim Moscow has dismissed as “simply not true”. One of the deals negotiated last summer to keep food supplies moving from ports in Ukraine is due to come up for renewal next month. Russia has sustained almost 143,000 casualties since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian military. The latest update from Ukraine’s ministry of defence said the number of casualties on the Russian side had reached 142,860, up by 590 since yesterday. It also said that 3,310 tanks and 6,545 armoured combat vehicles had been destroyed, increases of seven and 12 respectively. Tweeting the figures, the ministry included a quote from the Beatles’ 1968 song Back in the USSR: “Let me hear your balalaikas [a Russian instrument] ringing out.” President Zelensky has welcomed indications he has received in the last few days that attempts will be made to hold Russia legally accountable for crimes committed in Ukraine. Speaking in his nightly address, he said he had received “strong signals from our partners, and concrete agreements regarding the inevitability of holding Russia accountable for aggression, for terror against Ukraine and its people”. “Every Russian attack on … every corner of our state will have concrete legal consequences for the terrorist state. We have to restore justice,” he said. On Friday, it was announced that a body called the Register of Damages Caused by Russian Aggression to Ukraine will be set up in The Hague to keep a record of the damage to Ukrainian households, businesses, and infrastructure caused by the war. Addressing the Munich security conference on Saturday, the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, also said the US had formally determined that Russia had committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine. In his own speech, the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said that “we must see justice through the [international criminal court]” and “consider together how to ensure that Russia pays” towards the reconstruction of Ukraine. The US government has had conversations with Elon Musk about the use of Starlink satellite internet in Ukraine, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said. SpaceX this month said it had taken steps to prevent Ukraine’s military from using the company’s Starlink service to control drones, saying it was “never never meant to be weaponized”. In an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press with Chuck Todd, due to air on Sunday, Blinken was questioned about whether the US had asked Musk, who serves as Starlink’s chief executive, to remove the restrictions. “Well, I can’t share any conversations we’ve had other than to say we’ve had conversations,” he said. SpaceX has privately shipped truckloads of Starlink terminals to Ukraine, allowing its military to communicate by plugging them in and connecting them with the nearly 4,000 satellites SpaceX has so far launched into low-Earth orbit. Russia has attempted to jam Starlink signals in the region, though SpaceX countered by hardening the service’s software, Musk has said. France wants Russia to be defeated in Ukraine but it does not want to “crush” it, president Emmanuel Macron has told paper Le Journal du Dimanche. “I do not think, as some people do, that we must aim for a total defeat of Russia, attacking Russia on its own soil,” Macron said in an interview published on Saturday. “Those observers want to, above all else, crush Russia. That has never been the position of France and it will never be our position.” Macron has drawn criticism from some Nato allies for delivering mixed messages regarding his policy on the war between Ukraine and Russia, with some considering Paris a weak link in the western alliance. On Friday, Macron urged allies to step up military support for Ukraine. The US believes China may be about to provide lethal aid to help Russia in the war in Ukraine prompting a direct warning from the US secretary of state Antony Blinken to China’s top diplomat not to take the step. Blinken made the warning to the Chinese state councillor Wang Yi on Saturday evening at a meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference during which he also rebuked China over the use of an alleged spy balloon over US soil. In a blunt meeting he also urged China to stop helping Russia evade the impact of sanctions. China’s trade with Russia is increasing and it has been purchasing Russian oil, but probably below the $60 per barrel price cap imposed by the EU and G7 group of states. Blinken told US networks that the US had information China was considering whether to give Russia assistance, possibly including guns and weapons, for the Ukraine war. He made clear to Wang that “would have serious consequences in our relationship”. “There are various kinds of lethal assistance that they are at least contemplating providing, to include weapons,” Blinken said, adding that Washington would soon release more details. Wang told Blinken the United States must “face up to and resolve the damage” to bilateral relations “caused by the indiscriminate use of force”, according to a brief statement on Sunday by China’s foreign affairs ministry. Russia’s ambassador to the US on Sunday responded to the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, who accused Russia of crimes against humanity during its nearly year-long invasion of Ukraine. Harris made the comments a day earlier at the Munich security conference where, five days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion, western leaders are assessing Europe’s worst conflict since the second world war. “We regard such insinuations as an unprecedented attempt to demonise Russia in the framework of the hybrid war unleashed against us,” Anatoly Antonov said on the Russian embassy’s Telegram account. “There is no doubt that the purpose of such attacks by Washington is to justify its own actions to fuel the Ukrainian crisis.” The UN-backed Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says it has identified war crimes but has not concluded whether they amount to crimes against humanity. Organisations supported by the US Agency for International Development have documented more than 30,000 war crimes incidents since the invasion, according to the US government. Ukrainian officials said they were investigating the Thursday shelling of the city of Bakhmut as a possible war crime. Hello, this is Christine Kearney bringing you the latest developments in the Russia-Ukraine war. Moscow has responded to Joe Biden’s presidential administration announcing, at the Munich security conference, the US’s formal conclusion that Russia has committed crimes against humanity during its nearly year-long war against Ukraine. The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said: “In the case of Russia’s actions in Ukraine … there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity.” Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the US, responded on Sunday: “There is no doubt that the purpose of such attacks by Washington is to justify its own actions to fuel the Ukrainian crisis.” About 40 heads of state and government as well as politicians and security experts from nearly 100 countries – including the US, Europe and China – are attending the three-day conference to discuss Europe’s security situation amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. In other developments at 9am in Kyiv and 10am in Moscow: China’s senior diplomat Wang Yi, one of the few external politicians able to influence Russia, announced that China would launch its peace initiative on the anniversary of the war, and has been consulting Germany, Italy and France on its proposals. China had “neither stood by idly nor thrown fuel on the fire” regarding the crisis in Ukraine, he said. Western leaders have reacted nervously to the Chinese peace plan for Ukraine due to be revealed this week, but cautiously welcomed the move as a first sign that China recognises the war cannot be regarded solely as a European affair. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned Wang Yi of consequences should China provide material support to Russia’s invasion, saying in an interview after the two met that Washington was concerned Beijing was considering supplying weapons to Moscow. The top diplomats met at an undisclosed location on the sidelines of the Munich conference. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, called on the west to “double down” on its military support to Ukraine. “When Putin started this war, he gambled that our resolve would falter,” he said. “But we proved him wrong then, and we will prove him wrong now.” He also offered to help other countries that were willing to send aircraft to Ukraine now. The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said there was “no doubt” that Russia had committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine. Harris also warned that any Chinese support for Russia in its war in Ukraine would reward aggression. Ukraine must win its battle against Russia’s invasion, said Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, warning that a Russian victory might embolden Moscow to attack other countries. Pistorius said he assured the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Germany and its allies would help Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the EU wants to work with the defence industry to quicken and scale up the production of ammunition, both for the Ukrainian military and to replenish stocks at home. It follows warnings from Kyiv that its forces need more supplies quickly. Poland is ready to support Ukraine with its MiG jets, but only if a broader coalition is formed with the United States as a leader, said the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has said it is becoming “increasingly difficult” for the Russian government to “insulate the population” from the reality of the war. Air raid alerts were in place across much of western and southern Ukraine early on Saturday, with Ukrainian officials reporting that Russia fired four Kalibr missiles from the Black Sea. Two people were injured in a strike on the western city of Khmelnytskyi, according to the local mayor. One civilian was reported killed in shelling in the eastern city of Vovchansk, a few miles from the Russian border. Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday that its forces had captured Hrianykivka, a village in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region that is well to the north of most significant fighting. A briefing note from Ukraine’s general staff later on Saturday said the village was being shelled, but made no mention of an assault. The number of Russian soldiers killed since the invasion has reached 142,270, according to the Ukrainian military. A day earlier the UK’s defence ministry said as many as 60,000 Russian forces may have been killed in just under a year. The MoD said the casualty rate “has significantly increased since September 2022 when ‘partial mobilisation’ was imposed”. Most of Ukraine has power despite a series of major Russian attacks on the generating system, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday, praising the work done by repair crews. Russia has carried out repeated waves of attacks on key infrastructure, at times leaving millions of people without light, heating or running water."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-280-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-30T11:37:47Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 280 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-280-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-280-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 280 of the invasion","bodyText":"The EU will try to set up a court, backed by the UN, to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, according to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. In a video statement, she said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought death, devastation and unspeakable suffering. We all remember the horrors of Bucha. It is estimated that more than 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far.” Moscow has promoted the chief engineer of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Yuriy Chernichuk, to become its head, according to Russia’s nuclear agency Rosenergoatom. The position has been vacant since October, when Kyiv says the plant’s boss Ihor Murashov was abducted by Russian authorities. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram early on Wednesday morning that Russian strikes in the region overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. Ukraine claims to have killed another 500 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours, bringing the total it says have died in combat since 24 February to about 88,880. The general staff of the armed forces said it had taken out three more tanks, and another six armoured personnel carriers. Ukrainian forces have downed three Russian reconnaissance drones in the last 24 hours, according to its armed forces. In an early morning bulletin from Ukraine, the spokesperson for the general staff of the armed forces, Alexander Štupun, said Ukraine had been subjected to a number of missile attacks from planes and artillery, including on Kivsharivka in Kharkiv and Sloviansk in Donetsk. Both are in Ukraine’s east. Five Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces on Tuesday, according to a senior government official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, posted on Telegram that the five were all killed in Donetsk, with 15 people also injured. The Donetsk region has continued to face shelling by Russian troops. Others were wounded in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems. Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. The head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, spoke to Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday morning. They discussed the US’s support for the Grain from Ukraine scheme, which is running to get grain out of the port of Odesa, and its support for Ukraine over the winter months. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has highlighted Russia’s new foreign agents act in its daily update, which the MoD says will be used to crack down on critics and dissidents. Vladimir Putin has changed the existing 2012 law to mean that the personal details, including the address, of designated “foreign agents” can be published – meaning they could become targets of harassment. It will come into force on Thursday. The European Commission gave an update on Wednesday on its plans to freeze and confiscate Russian assets. “We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU’s executive. Nato doubled down on Tuesday on its commitment to one day include Ukraine, a pledge that some officials and analysts believe helped prompt Russia’s invasion this year. The world’s largest security alliance also pledged to send more aid to Ukrainian forces locked in battle with Russian troops. Ukraine’s supplies of spare parts for its battered electricity grid are running out amid sustained Russian bombing. European companies are being asked to urgently donate surplus kit to help the country get through the winter, after the latest step in Russian bombings targeting power plants and substations resulted in power cuts lasting 48 hours or more across the country. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato against providing Ukraine with Patriot missile defence systems and called the alliance a “criminal entity”. “If, as [Nato secretary general Jens] Stoltenberg hinted, Nato were to supply the Ukrainian fanatics with Patriot systems along with Nato personnel, they would immediately become a legitimate target of our armed forces,” Medvedev wrote on Telegram. Ukrainian forces struck a power plant in multiple attacks on Russia’s Kursk region on Tuesday, causing some electricity outages, the local governor said. “In total, there were about 11 launches. A power plant was hit,” Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region, said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility and made no immediate comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-moscow-plans-to-link-zaporzhzhia-nuclear-plant-to-crimea-operator-warns","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-10T18:00:25Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv says nine Russian planes destroyed in past 24 hours – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-moscow-plans-to-link-zaporzhzhia-nuclear-plant-to-crimea-operator-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-moscow-plans-to-link-zaporzhzhia-nuclear-plant-to-crimea-operator-warns","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv says nine Russian planes destroyed in past 24 hours – as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s main headlines: The EU has been urged to introduce a travel ban on Russian tourists with some member states saying visiting Europe was “a privilege, not a human right” for holidaymakers. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview with the Washington Post that the “most important sanction” was to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. China, which Russia has sought as an ally since being cold-shouldered by the west over its invasion of Ukraine, has called the US the “main instigator” of the crisis, Reuters reported. In an interview with the Russian state news agency Tass published on Wednesday, China’s ambassador to Moscow, Zhang Hanhui, accused Washington of backing Russia into a corner with repeated expansions of the Nato defence alliance Without claiming explicit responsibility for an attack on a Russian airfield in Crimea on Tuesday, Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said on Wednesday that it had destroyed nine Russian planes within the last 24 hours. It did not specify the locations. The claim follows widely reported explosions at Russia’s Saki air base. Crimea’s regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said some 250 residents were moved to temporary housing after dozens of apartment buildings were damaged, but Russian authorities have generally sought to downplay the explosions. Unverified social media footage purports to show damage to planes on the ground at the airport. Crimea’s regional ministry of health has said that one person died and 13 people were injured as a result of explosions at the air base near Novofedorivka. The Russian military have said that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area at the facility. Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014. The British defence secretary Ben Wallace said the UK has “pretty much dismissed” most of the Russian “excuses” for explosions at an air base in Crimea, and said he thinks the site would be a “legitimate target” for the Ukrainians. The United Nations expects to see a “big uptick” in applications for ships to export Ukraine grain after transit procedures were agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, a senior UN official said on Wednesday. The number of inbound vessels is expected to “grow in the near future” as grain deals are made, said Frederick Kenney, interim UN co-ordinator at the Joint Co-ordination Centre in Istanbul. Estonia has summoned the Russian ambassador and formally protested about the violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter on Tuesday, its foreign ministry said. “Estonia considers this an extremely serious and regrettable incident that is completely unacceptable,” the ministry said in a release, saying the helicopter had flown over a point in the southeast of the small Baltic nation without permission. In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not discuss who was behind the attacks but vowed to “liberate” Crimea, saying: “This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea – with its liberation.” An adviser to the president, Mikhail Podolyak, said Ukraine was not taking responsibility for the explosions, suggesting partisans might have been involved. Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are reorienting the plant’s electricity production to connect to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, according to Ukrainian operator Energoatom. “To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system. From August 7 to 9, the Russians have already damaged three power lines. At the moment, the plant is operating with only one production line, which is an extremely dangerous way of working,” Energoatom president Petro Kotin told Ukrainian television. The plant, located not far from the Crimean peninsula, has six of Ukraine’s 15 reactors, and is capable of supplying power for four million homes. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power firm warned of the “very high” risks from shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-occupied south and said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in time for winter. Energoatom’s chief, Petro Kotin, told Reuters in an interview that last week’s Russian shelling had damaged three lines that connect the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Ukrainian grid and that Russia wanted to connect the facility to its grid. Ukraine’s overseas creditors have backed its request for a two-year freeze on payments on almost $20 billion in international bonds, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday, a move that will allow the war-torn country to avoid a debt default. With no sign of peace or a ceasefire on the horizon nearly six months after Russia’s invasion began, bondholders have agreed to postpone sovereign interest and capital payments for thirteen Ukrainian sovereign bonds maturing between 2022 and 2033. Seven in 10 previous or current UK sponsors of Ukrainian refugees say their ability to provide support has been hindered by the cost of living crisis, figures have suggested. Some 21% of people who have hosted or are currently hosting Ukrainians in their homes said the rising cost of living has affected their ability to provide support “quite a lot”, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Russia’s daily military briefing for Wednesday has claimed to have shot down three Ukrainian planes overnight, and to have destroyed German-supplied anti-aircraft systems. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has said that in the last 24 hours two people have been killed and 25 civilians were injured in the territory it claims to control. That’s it from the Ukraine live blog for today. I’ll be back tomorrow morning but, for now, good night. The British defence secretary Ben Wallace said the UK has “pretty much dismissed” most of the Russian “excuses” for explosions at an air base in Crimea, and said he thinks the site would be a “legitimate target” for the Ukrainians. He told the BBC: I think when you just look at the footage of two simultaneous explosions not quite next to each other, and some of the reported damage even by the Russian authorities, I think it’s clear that that’s not something that happens by someone dropping a cigarette. Asked if the base was a legitimate target for the Ukrainians to strike, he said: First and foremost, Russia has illegally invaded, not just in 2014, but now Ukrainian territory. Ukraine, under United Nations articles, is perfectly entitled to defend its territory and take what action it needs to against an invading force. So, is it legitimate? It’s absolutely legitimate for Ukraine to take lethal force, if necessary, but take force in order to regain not only its territory, but also to push back its invader. And that air force base has been used by Russian air forces to bomb Ukrainian targets. So I think in anybody’s sort of manual of war it would be a legitimate target. Estonia has summoned the Russian ambassador and formally protested about the violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter on Tuesday, its foreign ministry said. “Estonia considers this an extremely serious and regrettable incident that is completely unacceptable,” the ministry said in a release, saying the helicopter had flown over a point in the southeast of the small Baltic nation without permission. Estonia made an identical complaint to Moscow in June, Reuters reported. The United Nations expects to see a “big uptick” in applications for ships to export Ukraine grain after transit procedures were agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, a senior UN official said on Wednesday. The number of inbound vessels is expected to “grow in the near future” as grain deals are made, said Frederick Kenney, interim UN co-ordinator at the Joint Co-ordination Centre in Istanbul, which oversees a deal between Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations to resume Ukraine grain exports. The EU has been urged to introduce a travel ban on Russian tourists with some member states saying visiting Europe was “a privilege, not a human right” for holidaymakers. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview with the Washington Post that the “most important sanction” was to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. Russians should “live in their own world until they change their philosophy”, he said. The Ukrainian president’s call was backed by Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, who tweeted that visiting Europe was “a privilege, not a human right”, adding: “Time to end tourism from Russia. Stop issuing tourist visas to Russians.” Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, has aired the same frustrations, telling public broadcaster YLE that it was “not right that while Russia is waging an aggressive, brutal war of aggression in Europe, Russians can live a normal life, travel in Europe, be tourists.” Finland has previously said that increasing numbers of Russians have begun crossing the 830-mile border between the two countries to shop in border stores and travel onwards to other EU destinations since Covid restrictions were lifted. Ukraine’s air force said it believed that up to a dozen Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground following Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which killed one, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine indicated the country had carried out the attack – but no public claim of responsibility was made by Kyiv of a dramatic incident that one expert believed may have been the product of a daring raid rather than a missile strike. Yuriy Ignat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, told national television that from studying video footage of the incident, it was clear “the aircraft weapons depot was hit”. He added: “And if additionally a dozen planes are destroyed there, it will be a real small victory.” Ukraine’s overseas creditors have backed its request for a two-year freeze on payments on almost $20 billion in international bonds, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday, a move that will allow the war-torn country to avoid a debt default. With no sign of peace or a ceasefire on the horizon nearly six months after Russia’s invasion began, bondholders have agreed to postpone sovereign interest and capital payments for thirteen Ukrainian sovereign bonds maturing between 2022 and 2033. The government in Kyiv launched a consent solicitation, which is a formal request to agree with creditors on changes to sovereign debt contracts, on 20 July, Reuters reported. Ukraine on Wednesday called on the European Union and G7 countries to stop issuing visas to Russian citizens, citing what he said was their support for the invasion of Ukraine. “Russians overwhelmingly support the war on Ukraine. They must be deprived of the right to cross international borders until they learn to respect them,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter. The tweet echoed earlier calls by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for a one-year travel ban and the apparent expulsion of Russians living in the West so they can live “in their own world until they change their philosophy”, Reuters reported. China, which Russia has sought as an ally since being cold-shouldered by the west over its invasion of Ukraine, has called the US the “main instigator” of the crisis, Reuters reported. In an interview with the Russian state news agency Tass published on Wednesday, China’s ambassador to Moscow, Zhang Hanhui, accused Washington of backing Russia into a corner with repeated expansions of the Nato defence alliance and support for forces seeking to align Ukraine with the European Union rather than Moscow. “As the initiator and main instigator of the Ukrainian crisis, Washington, while imposing unprecedented comprehensive sanctions on Russia, continues to supply arms and military equipment to Ukraine,” Zhang was quoted as saying. “Their ultimate goal is to exhaust and crush Russia with a protracted war and the cudgel of sanctions.” In case you missed it earlier today … Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us from Ukraine over the newswires. Without claiming explicit responsibility for an attack on a Russian airfield in Crimea on Tuesday, Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said on Wednesday that it had destroyed nine Russian planes within the last 24 hours. It did not specify the locations. The claim follows widely reported explosions at Russia’s Saki air base.

Unverified social media footage purports to show damage to planes on the ground at the airport. Ukraine has not directly taken credit for the strike, but few seem to give much credence to a Russian explanation that it was an accidental explosion. In its daily update, Ukraine’s army increased the number of planes it had claimed to have destroyed to 232 from 223. The Associated Press has spoken with Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov about the explosions. He said President Vladimir Putin has long insisted Crimea is Russian and warned that any attempts to take it back would trigger massive retaliation. He claimed Moscow’s apparent swallowing of the strike showed Putin’s weakness. “He’s expected to protect Crimea as Russia proper. Now he’s afraid to recognise that it was done by the Ukrainian armed forces,” he added. Russian warplanes have used Saki to strike at areas in Ukraine’s south. “Official Kyiv has kept mum about it, but unofficially the military acknowledges that it was a Ukrainian strike,” Zhdanov said. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said it couldn’t independently assess what caused the explosions, but noted that simultaneous explosions in two places at the base likely ruled out an accidental fire – but not the possibility of sabotage or a missile attack. But, it added: “The Kremlin has little incentive to accuse Ukraine of conducting strikes that caused the damage since such strikes would demonstrate the ineffectiveness of Russian air defence systems.” This is Martin Belam back on the live blog for an hour or so.

Some 21% of people who have hosted or are currently hosting Ukrainians in their homes said the rising cost of living has affected their ability to provide support “quite a lot”, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. A further 9% said it affected their ability to help “very much” while 41% said it had been affected “a little”, PA Media reported. Twenty-six per cent said it had not affected their ability to help at all while 3% replied “don’t know”. Four Russian missiles hit a village on the southern outskirts of Ukraine’s city of Zaporizhzhia early on Wednesday, killing a 52-year-old woman, whose body was found in the rubble, the regional governor said. “Four private buildings have been totally destroyed. Several dozen houses have been left without windows and roofs,” governor Oleksandr Starukh wrote on Telegram. Rescue workers were still digging through the rubble hours later, the governor said. Electricity and gas supply to the village of Kushuhum were also disrupted, he added. A Ukrainian mother and her son prepare to leave Lisbon, where they went to flee the war two and a half months ago. Despite ongoing conflict with Russian forces in the south and east of the country, the UN Refugee Agency has reported more than 4.4m border crossings back into Ukraine since 28 February. Many of those crossing are thought to be Ukrainians heading back to parts of the country now considered relatively safe, hoping to reunite with family, rebuild their country and restart their lives. Katya and Nazar set off for Kyiv hoping to make it in time to celebrate Nazar’s ninth birthday. Russian authorities have raided the home of a former state TV journalist who quit after making an on-air protest against Moscow’s war in Ukraine. They have also launched a criminal case against her on the charge of spreading false information about Russian armed forces, her lawyer said on social media. The case against Marina Ovsyannikova was launched under a law, enacted after the 24 February invasion of Ukraine, that penalises statements against the military, lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said. If convicted, she faces up to 15 years in prison, the Associated Press reported. Zakhvatov told the independent news site Meduza the case is probably linked to a protest Ovsyannikova staged last month, holding a banner that said “Putin is a killer, his soldiers are fascists”. After the raid, Ovsyannikova is expected to be brought into the Investigative Committee for questioning, he said on Telegram. Ovsyannikova previously worked as a producer with the Russian state-funded Channel One. She made international headlines on 14 March when she appeared behind the anchor of an evening news broadcast holding a poster that said “stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here”. She was charged with disparaging the Russian military and fined 30,000 roubles (around £223.40 at the time). Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are reorienting the plant’s electricity production to connect to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, according to Ukrainian operator Energoatom. “To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system.

Russia’s daily military briefing for Wednesday has claimed to have shot down three Ukrainian planes overnight, and to have destroyed German-supplied anti-aircraft systems. A Russian airbase deep behind the frontline in Crimea has been damaged by several large explosions that occurred on Tuesday, killing at least one person. It was not immediately clear whether it had been targeted by a long-range Ukrainian missile strike. Crimea’s regional ministry of health has said that, additionally 13 people were injured as a result of explosions at the airport in Novofedorivka. Ukraine’s army claims to have destroyed nine Russian planes in the last 24 hours. It did not specify the locations. The Russian military have said that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area at the facility.

The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has said that in the last 24 hours two people have been killed and 25 civilians were injured in the territory it claims to control. At least 13 people have been killed overnight by shelling in Marhanets in Dnipropetrovsk. Regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said more than 20 buildings were damaged. Ukraine’s emergency service has distributed images which appear to show a school in Marhanets damaged by an attack. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, said that as a result of shelling at around 1.40am Wednesday morning, three people, including a 13-year-old girl, were injured in the city of Mykolaiv. He said residential buildings were damaged as a result of shelling. The leaders of Estonia and Finland want fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take holidays in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine. The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, wrote on Tuesday on Twitter that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right” and that it was “time to end tourism from Russia now”, the Associated Press reported. Denmark will send military instructors to Britain to train Ukrainian soldiers and also aims to train Ukrainian officers in Denmark, the Danish defence minister said in an interview with the Jyllands-Posten newspaper published Wednesday. The US state department has approved $89m-worth of assistance to help Ukraine equip and train 100 teams to clear landmines and unexploded ordnance for a year, Reuters reported. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Tom Ambrose will be here shortly to continue our coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Denmark will send military instructors to Britain to train Ukrainian soldiers and also aims to train Ukrainian officers in Denmark, the Danish defence minister said in an interview with the Jyllands-Posten newspaper published today. Reuters reports the interview precedes a conference in Copenhagen on Thursday when British, Danish and Ukrainian defence ministers are expected to discuss long-term support for Ukraine, including military training, mine clearance and weapon supplies. “Within a short time, Denmark is sending 130 military instructors to a British training project,” defence minister Morten Bodskov told the newspaper. The Danish defence ministry had no immediate comment. Ukraine’s emergency services has issued some photographs this morning that it claims shows the damage in Marhanets after it was strike by Russian shelling. Early, the regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said at least 13 people died. Russia’s military briefing for the day has claimed to have shot down three Ukrainian planes overnight, and to have destroyed German-supplied anti-aircraft systems. It states that it has killed up to a further 130 Ukrainian service personnel. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces has issued updated figures this morning for the losses it says it has inflicted on pro-Russian forces. Notably, without specifying where it happened, today’s figures indicate they destroyed nine Russian planes or helicopters in the last 24 hours. It claims to have killed “about 42,800” military personnel in total since 24 February, an increase of 160 on the day before. It also said: “The opponent suffered the biggest losses in the Donetsk direction.” The daily operational briefing from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has claimed that in the last 24 hours two people have been killed and 25 civilians were injured in the territory it claims to control. It says this came after Ukrainian forces shelled 10 of the 266 settlements it claims have been “liberated” from Ukrainian forces. It says 72 houses and nine civil infrastructure facilities were damaged. None of the claims have been independently verified. The DPR is recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states, including Russia. This morning we have been sent some images over the newswires from inside occupied Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. The pictures were taken on a trip organised by the Russian military, and appear designed to show that ordinary work and life continues under the auspices of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). Several of the photographs were taken at a coal mining operation in Dolzhansk. The LPR was formed in 2014, and is recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. One image released shows the leader of the self-proclaimed LPR, Leonid Pasechnik, attending a movie premiere for a film entitled Match, which glorifies the actions of Soviet Union soldiers during the second world war. Another part of the trip appears to have been to demonstrate that an equestrian school was running as normal. The RIA Novosti news agency is reporting that Crimea’s regional ministry of health has said that 13 people were injured and one died as a result of explosions at the airport in Novofedorivka. It quotes the authority’s statement saying: “As of 8.30am, as a result of an incident in the urban-type settlement of Novofedorivka, Saki district, 13 people were injured and one person died.” RIA goes on to report that “one person was hospitalised in the Saki regional hospital, another 10 patients with minor injuries, including two minors, received medical care on an outpatient basis. Two more victims went to Simferopol hospital No 6, after rendering assistance they were allowed to go home.” The claims have not been independently verified, and the cause of the explosions remains somewhat unclear. Ukraine’s presidential adviser Mykhail Podolyak has denied Ukrainian responsibility for an attack, and the Russian military have said only that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area. There is some clarification here on the numbers killed overnight in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Reuters reports governor Valentyn Reznichenko now says that at least 13 people died after shelling there. He said more than 20 buildings were damaged in Marhanets, a city across the Dnipro River from the Russian-captured Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. The attack damaged a power line, leaving several thousand people without electricity, Reznichenko said. The attack damaged a hostel, two schools, a concert hall, the main council building and other administrative bases, he added. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians, despite the evidence of damage to civil infrastructure in Ukrainian cities, towns and villages. Lviv’s governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, has said the night passed without incident in his western region of Ukraine. He said that 306 people arrived in evacuation trains from the east of the country, where the fighting is concentrated. He said that 761 left on evacuation trains to Poland. Here are some of the latest images we have been sent from inside Ukraine and Crimea over the newswires. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has posted to Telegram to say that as a result of shelling at around 1.40am, three people, including a 13 year-old girl, were injured in the city of Mykolaiv. He said residential buildings were damaged as a result of shelling. He also claimed that yesterday, during the day, there had been several fires in the fields caused by Russian attacks, and that “settlements of the Bereznehuvate community, located on the demarcation line, remain under constant fire”. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam with the live blog in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Ukrainian officials are reporting that 11 people were killed and 13 wounded by Russian shelling in the Nikopol district in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region overnight. Residential homes were reportedly damaged in the attack and as many as 1,000 people are without gas, the regional regional military administration said. Russian commanders are likely to be faced with the competing operational priorities of reinforcing the Donbas offensive, and strengthening defences against anticipated Ukrainian counter attacks in the south. To support the Ukraine operation, Russia has “almost certainly” established a major new ground forces formation, 3rd Army Corps (3 AC), based out of Mulino, in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast east of Moscow, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. The latest British intelligence report reads: Russia likely plans to resource a large proportion of 3 AC from newly formed ‘volunteer’ battalions, which are being raised across the country, and which group together recruits from the same areas. Russian regional politicians have confirmed that potential 3 AC recruits are being offered lucrative cash bonuses once they deploy to Ukraine. Recruitment is open to men up to 50 years old and with only middle-school education. A Russian army corps typically consists of 15-20,000 troops, but it will probably be difficult for Russia to bring 3 AC up to this strength, given very limited levels of popular enthusiasm for volunteering for combat in Ukraine. 3 AC’s effect is unlikely to be decisive to the campaign.” The US state department has approved $89m worth of assistance to help Ukraine equip and train 100 teams to clear landmines and unexploded ordnance for a year, officials said in a statement on Tuesday. The funding is the largest US de-mining program yet in Ukraine, and the official compared Ukraine’s challenge to attempts to disarm unexploded ordnance in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos following the American war of the 1960s and 70s in Southeast Asia. “If you look at some conflicts in the not so distant past, the Vietnam War for example, we’re still clearing ordnance in Southeast Asia 50 years after that war ended. This may be on par with that,” the official said. The program would be run through contractors and non-governmental organisations the official said. He said the money, part of which comes from Ukraine-linked budget requests, will not only fund training, but specialised mine detection and earth moving equipment if need be. A Ukrainian official said the aid addressed one of the country’s most important tasks. “By our estimates, 160,000 square kilometres of Ukrainian land need de-mining, which is about the size of Virginia, Maryland and Connecticut combined,” said Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s top aide. “This aid will accelerate Ukraine’s recovery,” Zelenskiy’s chief of staff said in a Telegram post. US president Joe Biden formally welcomed Finland and Sweden joining the Nato alliance Tuesday as he signed the documents of ratification that delivered the US’s formal backing of the Nordic nations entering the mutual defence pact. The move is the most significant expansion of the military alliance since the 1990s as it responds to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In seeking to join Nato, Finland and Sweden are making a sacred commitment that an attack against one is an attack against all,” Biden said at the signing as he called the partnership the “indispensable alliance.” Finland and Sweden’s decision to join Nato is a watershed moment for our Alliance. It will help ensure greater security and stability for our world,” Biden added. On a slightly lighter note, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is being made into an action figure by a product design company in Brooklyn, New York. FCTRY launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production two weeks ago, hitting its $30,000 funding goal in just three hours and raising more than $120,000 since. For every figure sold, $1 goes to Ukraine in the campaign which ends on Friday. A six-inch (15-cm) tall clay prototype of the Zelenskiy action figure, moulded by Seattle artist Mike Leavitt, will be mass produced in plastic in China. It is expected to ship by March. “The way we framed him in the campaign is ‘the unlikely hero,’” said Jason Feinberg, FCTRY’s chief executive and creative director. “He’s the perfect leader for this moment, just this super inspirational character. He has this real strength that comes across, but it’s humble and he sort of represents the opposite of everything that we’ve come to associate with politics.” In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not discuss who was behind the attacks in Crimea but vowed to “liberate” the region. This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea - with its liberation. Russia has turned our peninsula, which has always been and will be one of the best places in Europe, into one of the most dangerous places in Europe. But we will return to the Ukrainian Crimea. From the Kharkiv region to Kherson, from Donetsk to Enerhodar, from Stanytsia Luhanska to Yalta, from Berdyansk to Novofedorivka – these are all parts of our country, this is Ukraine, which will be completely free.” Ukraine is not taking responsibility for explosions at a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, suggesting partisans might have been involved. Mykhail Podolyak, asked by the Dozhd online television channel whether Kyiv was taking responsibility, replied: “Of course not. What do we have to do with this?” Earlier, he appeared to suggest the strike could herald a new phase of the conflict. Podolyak said that Kyiv’s long-term goal was “demilitarisation of the Russian Federation”. He added: “The future of the Crimea is to be a pearl of the Black Sea, a national park with unique nature and a world resort. Not a military base for terrorists. It is just the beginning.” Ukraine’s defence ministry said it could not determine the cause of the explosions but added, sardonically, that people should have regard for the rules of fire safety and “the prohibition of smoking in unspecified places”. A Russian airbase deep behind the frontline in Crimea has been damaged by several large explosions, killing at least one person. Multiple social media videos showed explosions and clouds emerging from the Saky military base in Novofedorivka on the western coast of Crimea on Tuesday afternoon, prompting questions about how a location more than 100 miles (160km) from the frontline could have been attacked. Russia’s defence ministry told the RIA Novosti news agency that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area. It is not clear whether it had been targeted by a long-range Ukrainian missile strike. Russian tourists holidaying on beaches nearby could be seen leaving in fear. It is one of few occasions that the peninsula, occupied by Russia since 2014, has been directly affected by the latest fighting. Local people told one Russian news site that explosions went on for an hour. Sergey Aksyonov, the Russian-appointed head of occupied Crimea, said one person had died. Earlier, he had filmed a video statement near the site, with smoke rising in the distance, saying that ambulance crews and medics were on the scene. Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeast Ukraine are preparing to connect the plant to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, and are damaging it by reorienting its electricity production, Ukrainian operator Energoatom warned. Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and was occupied by Russia early in its invasion. Energoatom president Petro Kotin told Reuters news agency that Russia wanted to connect the plant to its grid, a technically difficult process that requires the facility to be severed from the Ukrainian system before it can be gradually connected to the Russian one. Their plan is to damage all the lines from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. After that it will not be connected to the Ukrainian power system,” he said. Kotin also told Ukrainian television and Interfax news agency: The Russian military present at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are implementing the program of [Russian operator] Rosatom aimed at connecting the plant to the Crimean electricity grid. To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system. From August 7 to 9, the Russians have already damaged three power lines. At the moment, the plant is operating with only one production line, which is an extremely dangerous way of working. When the last production line is disconnected, the plant will be powered by generators running on diesel. Everything will then depend on their reliability and fuel stocks.” The process of de-energisation of the plant in preparation to connect to Russia would be extremely dangerous, Kotin warned. At the ZNPP, we are already very close to this first stage of Fukushima-1, because there is only one line. As soon as it is turned off, the station will switch to diesel, and after that everything will depend on the reliability of their work and the sufficiency of the fuel that is there for diesel engines at the ZNPP.” Kotin also spoke with CNN, reiterating his claims that the ultimate plan of the Russians is to disconnect the plant from powering Ukraine and connect it to the grid to power occupied Crimea. If there is no connection to the grid, then you cannot provide electricity from the outside, then the diesel generators will start. But everything will depend on the reliability of those generators. … This is a dangerous situation, because if those stop you could have a disaster of melting nuclear materials,” he said, comparing the potential fallout to the Fukishima disaster in Japan. If the situation worsens, we need to think about our population at the plant. We are planning on how, during war conditions, we will be able to evacuate the personnel. Great release of radioactivity could happen from there. There could be a cloud, a radioactive cloud.” Located not far from the Crimean peninsula, the plant has six of Ukraine’s 15 reactors, capable of supplying power for four million homes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday raised the spectre of nuclear disaster after strikes on the plant. And UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that any attack on a nuclear plant would be “suicidal”. “I hope that those attacks will end, and at the same time I hope that the IAEA will be able to access the plant,” he said Monday. Recent fighting around the plant has prompted the UN nuclear watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to warn of the “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Ukraine has denied responsibility for explosions at a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, suggesting partisans might have been involved. Meanwhile, Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeast Ukraine are preparing to connect the plant to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, and are damaging it by reorienting its electricity production, Ukrainian operator Energoatom warned. It is 7.30am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: A Russian airbase deep behind the frontline in Crimea has been damaged by several large explosions, killing at least one person. It was not immediately clear whether it had been targeted by a long-range Ukrainian missile strike. In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not discuss who was behind the attacks but vowed to “liberate” Crimea, saying: “This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea – with its liberation.” An adviser to the president, Mikhail Podolyak, said Ukraine was not taking responsibility for the explosions, suggesting partisans might have been involved. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power firm warned of the “very high” risks from shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-occupied south and said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in time for winter. Energoatom’s chief, Petro Kotin, told Reuters in an interview that last week’s Russian shelling had damaged three lines that connect the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Ukrainian grid and that Russia wanted to connect the facility to its grid. The leaders of Estonia and Finland want fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take holidays in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine. The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, wrote on Tuesday on Twitter that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right” and that it was “time to end tourism from Russia now”, the Associated Press reported. US president Joe Biden on Tuesday signed documents endorsing Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato, the most significant expansion of the military alliance since the 1990s as it responds to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. The US state department has approved $89m worth of assistance to help Ukraine equip and train 100 teams to clear landmines and unexploded ordnance for a year, Reuters reported. The total number of grain-carrying ships to leave Ukrainian ports under a UN brokered deal to ease the global food crisis has now reached 12, with the two latest ships which left on Tuesday headed for Istanbul and Turkey. Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad has been struggling with quotas imposed by the EU for sanctioned goods that it can import across Lithuania from mainland Russia or Belarus, the region’s governor admitted. Lithuania infuriated Moscow in June by banning the land transit of goods such as concrete and steel to Kaliningrad after EU sanctions on them came into force, Reuters reported. Russia has launched an Iranian satellite from Kazakhstan amid concerns it could be used for battlefield surveillance in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Iran has denied that the Khayyam satellite, which was delivered into orbit onboard a Soyuz rocket launched from Baikonur cosmodrome, would ever be under Russian control. But the Washington Post previously reported that Moscow told Tehran it “plans to use the satellite for several months, or longer, to enhance its surveillance of military targets” in Ukraine, according to two US officials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/15/wind-hydrogen-no-demolitions-how-next-pm-can-put-uk-on-net-zero-path","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T05:00:30Z","webTitle":"Wind, hydrogen, no demolitions: how next PM can put UK on net zero path","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/15/wind-hydrogen-no-demolitions-how-next-pm-can-put-uk-on-net-zero-path","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/15/wind-hydrogen-no-demolitions-how-next-pm-can-put-uk-on-net-zero-path","fields":{"headline":"Wind, hydrogen, no demolitions: how next PM can put UK on net zero path","bodyText":"There is little mention of Boris Johnson’s “green industrial revolution” on the campaign trail of the two Conservative party leadership candidates. Maybe it’s not surprising when Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are focused on formulating plans to deal with the more immediate energy crisis. That said, Labour and the Liberal Democrats are pressing ahead with announcing the investments they would make to achieve net zero by 2050. A new prime minister could do worse than crack on with some of the plans in Johnson’s 10-point programme, announced to great fanfare in 2020. The plans are behind schedule and several of the ideas are considered by experts to be dead ends. The CBI has accused the government of relying too heavily on private-sector investment, which it blames for Britain falling behind Europe and the US. The Biden administration is poised to pass a near $370bn bill to promote climate-friendly infrastructure. Johnson’s 10-point plan committed the government to spending £12bn. The government’s own adviser, the Climate Change Committee, said the money on offer needed to be closer to £50bn to make a difference. Nevertheless, piecing together the ideas and investment needed to create a zero-carbon economy is achievable and could create more sustainable jobs, if the new regime can decide what it wants to do. Offshore wind The offshore wind industry has put the UK in the front rank of countries managing the switch away from fossil fuels. More arrays in the sea are planned on the east and west coast. Official figures show that meeting net zero targets would mean cutting gas use by 65% by 2035, and almost 100% by 2050. At the moment gas accounts for about 90% of home heating and 40% of electricity generation. At 37%, heating accounts for the largest proportion of UK greenhouse gas emissions. Kwasi Kwarteng, a chief ally of Truss’s, said this year he would expand onshore wind, helping speed up the transition. While the UK has only limited capacity to make wind turbines, and the number of jobs created by businesses servicing windfarms is small in relation to the size of the investment, the employment is highly skilled and expert firms could export their knowhow. Sunak said at a recent hustings that regulations governing offshore wind, rooftop solar and nuclear would be overhauled to scale up supply, despite the critics arguing that solar is held back by a lack of power storage facilities and all renewables are at the mercy of an electricity grid in desperate need of an upgrade to cope with a coal, oil and gas-free world. Low-carbon hydrogen The UK’s ambition for hydrogen production was recently doubled to 10 gigawatts by 2030. Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable electricity to drive an electrolyser that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The gas is burned to produce power, emitting water vapour, warm air, and no carbon greenhouse gases. But, depending on the method of burning, it can also cause health-harming air pollution and, as a climate-heating gas itself, any leakage of hydrogen could offset some of the advantages of its use. A favourite of the Tees Valley mayor, Ben Houchen, hydrogen is also seen as the green fuel of the future by the car company Toyota and the Spanish energy firm Iberdrola, which owns Europe’s largest production site for green hydrogen for industrial use, at Puertollano in Spain. Iberdrola’s subsidiary Scottish Power plans to use government subsidies to build a 100 megawatt plant at Felixstowe to provide enough fuel to power 1,300 hydrogen trucks operating inside the port from 2026. Hydrogen cells could take over from diesel to power trucks, farm equipment and diggers, but there would need to be significant funding to create a UK industry. Nuclear power There is a new power station taking shape at Hinkley Point in Somerset and the government has approved another at the Sizewell site in Suffolk at an expected cost of £20bn. Both will be built by the French electricity company EDF. The Sizewell C site could be challenged if local people pursue an appeal over the next few weeks. The CBI boss, Tony Danker, has urged the government to push on with the investment, and Sunak has promised to go ahead should he become leader, presumably whatever challenges lie ahead. Delays and cost overruns are likely and could help Rolls-Royce, which expects to have a series of mini-nuclear power stations ready by the end of the decade, though these have faced their own time and cost overruns. Zero-emission vehicles Britain spends about £27bn on new roads but very little on subsidising electric car production or the infrastructure of charging points that supports electric vehicles. Car firms, almost all of them foreign-owned, have complained that subsidies for UK production are small. Car parts suppliers have little incentive to adapt to electric cars. The battery maker BritishVolt is on “life support” as it wrestles with funding problems. Green public transport, cycling and walking Public transport is becoming green as electric buses become more popular. Electric cycles and scooters are being adopted at a rapid pace in some towns and cities. Cars are being forced to lower their speed in built-up areas. But pedestrians are being left out of schemes to create more livable cities, persuading families to stick with the suburbs and new housing estates that rely on private car travel. More investment in electric-powered trains would create jobs and make links across the railway network more reliable. There are plans to electrify the Midland mainline and the Transpennine route and upgrade the east coast mainline, but with HS2 likely to be stopped at Manchester, the spur to Leeds abandoned and HS3 across the northern cities scrapped, the opportunities to revive the push for electrification are many. The payback from integrating cycling, walking and public transport will be significant, as the Netherlands and Denmark have found. Greener buildings A building with solid walls built before the second world war costs about £20,000 to insulate and between £10,000 and £20,000 for a heat pump. There are about 8m of these homes. Even the best-insulated homes gain a category B certificate when an A is needed to meet zero carbon targets. It means even those built or refurbished in the last 30 years will need another facelift. And before embarking on this investment, ministers must stop developers checking their own homework. There are concerns that builders are cutting corners knowing local authorities lack the staff to check on them. Sunak or Truss could also put a moratorium on the demolition of existing commercial and residential buildings. The UK would put itself at the forefront of a global construction industry that focuses on refurbishing existing structures to make them low-carbon. Most architects and developers remain attached to the idea of constructing new buildings, but western countries have most of what they need if the current stock is upgraded and empty homes are brought back into use. Natural environment Protecting nature has obvious benefits. Sunak commissioned a 360-page report from the eminent Cambridge economist Partha Dasgupta detailing how the economy will suffer unless we protect the natural environment, but didn’t say what action he would take. Chancellors always delay taking action because while they understand investments create jobs and save the exchequer money in the future from flooding and drought, it is less clear how it creates businesses that generate tax income or export cash. • This article was amended on 18 August 2022. An earlier version said that no greenhouse gases are emitted when green hydrogen is burned; that meant to refer to carbon greenhouse gases. It was further amended on 14 November 2022 to provide more details about the possible effects of using green hydrogen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2021/may/07/doom-by-niall-ferguson-review-how-to-make-sense-of-catastrophe","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-07T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"Doom by Niall Ferguson review – how to make sense of catastrophe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/may/07/doom-by-niall-ferguson-review-how-to-make-sense-of-catastrophe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2021/may/07/doom-by-niall-ferguson-review-how-to-make-sense-of-catastrophe","fields":{"headline":"Doom by Niall Ferguson review – how to make sense of catastrophe","bodyText":"The bad news is that plagues are a constant companion to human civilisation. The good news is that we are getting better at explaining their causes and treating them without recourse to superstition. When the Black Death ravaged Europe in the 14th century, troupes of flagellants proceeded from town to town, surrounding local churches, beating themselves with spiky, iron-tipped leather scourges. They saw the disease as divine punishment and prayed fervently for release from its clutches, all the while aiding its dispersal across the land. The medical treatments they needed were nearly 600 years away. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought its share of irrational fanaticism. There is something medieval about paranoid mobs felling mobile phone masts in the belief that 5G signals are responsible for the disease. But that minor skirmish is far from the frontline in a battle that science is winning, at least until the next disaster strikes. The march of progress gives cause for optimism; the certain recurrence of disaster less so. That tension is the subject of Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe, Niall Ferguson’s excursion into the history of horrible afflictions. It is not a gloomy book, although it dwells often on our collective failure to learn from past mistakes. Ferguson’s interest is the patterns and systems that emerge from the repetition, to which end he skips quite breezily through a rich catalogue of gruesome, miserable experiences: floods, earthquakes that swallow whole cities, volcanic eruptions that bring humans to the brink of extinction, wars, famines and an array of lower-division horrors. The sinking of the Titanic and nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl exhibit at microcosmic level much the same “fractal geometry of disaster” discernible in the macro calamities. Ferguson’s rundown of disasters combines the man-made and natural kinds, exploring the boundary between the two. Sometimes it is distinct. The Romans did not provoke Vesuvius, whereas the Germans did invade Belgium in 1914. But in many cases, humanity is the accomplice to mass suffering from what looks ostensibly like natural causes, as when the Spanish flu ripped through barracks and trenches towards the end of the first world war. The virus racked up a much higher body count than bullets and artillery. Likewise, terrible politics can manufacture calamity out of nature, as when Stalin’s collectivisation policy led to famine in Ukraine and sustained it with repression. There are few cases where responsibility can be attributed so directly. There is usually too much chaos and complexity for any individual to have agency over the sweep of events. With some caveats, Ferguson endorses the view expressed by Tolstoy in War and Peace, that Napoleon was the slave of historical forces beyond his comprehension, not their master. Leaders can be morally accountable for calamitous errors of judgment and, as with Hitler and the Third Reich, epoch-defining atrocities. But culpability is not all of causation. The origin of most catastrophes is elusive. There are too many threads going back too far, but also apparently stable situations can spiral abruptly out of control. It can take centuries for empires to decline, as happened with Rome, but they can also unravel overnight. The USSR passed from superpower status to non-existence in a matter of months. If there are no patterns discernible with hindsight, the individual living through some traumatic event has practically zero chance of making sense of it in real time. Mercifully, the human spirit is primed to get on with life in almost any circumstances. Sometimes, the best available explanation is expressed in a formula that Ferguson traces back to a San Francisco gang member cited in a master’s dissertation from 1964: “Shit happens.” Ferguson would hardly be fulfilling his remit as a historian if he stopped there. He does identify recurrent traits from the vast back catalogue of misfortune. When it comes to finding fault, he is particularly exercised by bureaucratic failure, which he finds in cases of industrial accident and, most recently, in British and American responses to Covid-19. There is no disputing the harm that can be done by institutional inertia, group-think and mediocre middle managers pursuing perverse incentives (or just trying to shirk difficult choices). The Challenger space shuttle disaster makes a good case study. Pressure to meet a launch target overrode known concerns about a design flaw that proved fatal. But when it comes to the pandemic, Ferguson starts to reveal his conservative aversion to big states. He is not exactly forgiving of Donald Trump (“manifestly idiotic” is the verdict on one episode of maladministration), but the former president is treated more as a pathetic accessory to the disaster than a motor of it. In the UK context, Boris Johnson’s equivocations and delays are leapfrogged in eagerness to find fault with scientists and officials advising the prime minister. Notably absent, too, is recognition of the fiscal background to Britain’s pandemic – the possibility that Covid wreaked more harm because the public realm had been depleted by decades of budget cuts. Ferguson’s speciality is financial history, so he surely has a position on that point, but we don’t know what it is. There are other flashes of political partisanship that feel out of place in a historical account. The death toll in care homes is cast, gnomically, as “a paradoxical result of fetishising the National Health Service at the expense of institutions beyond its aegis”. Ferguson is sceptical of lockdowns on the basis of their economic impact, embracing the familiar fallacy that government suffocated livelihoods in exchange for an insufficient dividend in lives saved. In reality, failure to lock down would have drastically increased the economic harm by prolonging the whole ordeal. But on this, too, there is an ideological tell in Ferguson’s description of Covid regulation as “varying degrees of house arrest” – a formula that conflates necessary public health measures and authoritarian spite. By the author’s admission, the pandemic section of the book is unfinished and vulnerable to refutation by post-publication events. But by that stage in the narrative there is already a sense the book has drifted from its original purpose. What began as a taxonomy of doom evolves into a hawkish foreign policy treatise on the coming cold war with China. It is a bracing polemical finale that seems to round off a different book to the one that started in philosophical meditation over death as life’s unshakable shadow. Perhaps a more satisfying conclusion was simply unavailable. Doom covers an impressive sweep of history at a lively narrative clip and weaves a lot of disparate strands together into an engaging picture, even if they cannot, in the end, be arranged into a meaningful pattern. While it would have been a tidier volume if all of mankind’s historic woes had been drawn into a coherent model, with predictability and rules, it is to Ferguson’s credit as a historian that he accepts the futility of that endeavour. He is wise, in the end, not to posit a grand theory of catastrophe, when his exploration of the subject proves the absence of any such thing. • Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe by Niall Ferguson is published by Allen Lane (£25).

Or is it just more hot air?","bodyText":"Is Australia’s multibillion dollar gas industry going to help the region and the world decarbonise, as its supporters and the industry claims? Neat soundbites that gas is less dirty than coal, or factoids suggesting liquefied natural gas exports are pushing out those of more polluting coal, are plentiful and slip easily from the tongue, but are almost always bereft of detail. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, was asked last week about the future of one mega-project already approved in his state – Woodside’s $12bn Scarborough LNG development. On climate change, McGowan said opposing gas sets up a “conundrum” and that “if we don’t provide gas, well, other countries put in more coal”. He told reporters that burning coal generated “two or three times the emissions” of gas. The new resources minister, Madeleine King, in comments reported in The West Australian on Thursday, said countries such as Japan, Korea and China were “demanding our gas for their path to net zero” and LNG projects would help countries “reduce their reliance on other fossil fuels that are higher carbon emitters”. “Australia’s gas industry is part of a decarbonising world – and it’s urgent,” she said. There are two huge problems with this, and both should be good reasons for politicians and commentators to hold back with their LNG truisms. One is the array of questions you need to answer before you can compare the climate impacts of gas to coal, not only in terms of emissions but also the effect that supplying LNG has on the uptake of renewable energy. Another is that although claims of LNG being significantly less dirty than coal have been made for more than a decade, there is practically no evidence to back this up. There is, however, plenty of analysis showing LNG is only marginally less bad for the climate than coal – some commissioned by the gas industry itself. Dimitri Lafleur is a carbon analyst at Global Carbon Insights, a research group funded by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility. He says statements like those made by McGowan are always “incomplete”. “Purely on a unit of energy basis, the combustion of gas is 60% of coal emissions. But then you have to look at the quality of the gas, the quality of the coal,” he says, noting you also have to consider what the gas is being used for. Calculations often ignore the impact of fugitive emissions – the loss of the potent greenhouse gas methane that can leak anywhere along the LNG supply chain – or the emissions from the vast amounts of energy used to liquefy the gas and then regasify the product it at its final destination (the biggest consumer of Australian gas is actually the country’s own LNG industry). “You need to have all of that in your calculations. It’s misleading to always come back to this idea that gas is only 60% or 50% of the emissions of coal,” Lafleur says. Temperature Check asked McGowan’s office for the basis of his statement that other countries would revert to coal if they were not sold gas, or that gas was less dirty. The questions were not answered, but a statement said: “The Premier reiterates his support of gas as a transition fuel noting there is strong demand from trading partners looking for lower-emissions energy sources.” In 2019, Woodside actually commissioned CSIRO to “test the assumption through modelling scenarios that an increase in LNG in Asia will lead to a reduction in GHG emissions and support deployment of renewable electricity generation”. What was the conclusion? Unsurprisingly, the answer was nuanced, as it should be, but it contrasted with the simplistic claims often made about LNG. “Gas can assist [greenhouse gas] emissions mitigation during the period when carbon prices or equivalent signals are strong enough to force high renewable electricity generation shares,” it said. “Until the carbon price reaches that strength, increased gas supply’s impact on emissions reduction is either negative or neutral. “Also, after renewables have reached a high share, additional gas supply has nothing further to contribute to emission reduction.” Australia’s two biggest LNG customers, according to the Office of the Chief Economist, are China and Japan. Analysis carried out a decade ago by engineering firm WorleyParsons (now known as Worley) looked at the emissions of Australian LNG if it was exported to China and burned in power stations. The least dirty LNG produced from conventional wells burned in the most efficient gas plants generated 0.65 tonnes of CO2 per megawatt hour. LNG from coal seams (the basis for Queensland’s LNG export industry) was dirtier, at 0.73 tonnes per megawatt hour. This is compared to black coal, which generated 0.78 tonnes per megawatt hour in the most efficient power stations and 1.03 tonnes in the dirtiest. But crucially the WorleyParsons study noted that when LNG was exported for electricity its greenhouse gas profile was at least 22 times dirtier than wind and 13 times dirtier than nuclear power. Climate class action The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has promised an “end to the climate wars”. But the newly endorsed opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has signalled he wants to extend this particular cultural battleground to children’s classrooms. The Sky News host and News Corp commentator Andrew Bolt told Dutton this week that kids were crying with fear over the climate crisis, even though dams were filling, crops were getting bigger and they had “never been less likely to die in a climate catastrophe”. “Are you going to be the voice that says, look at the science, it’s not the climate crisis a lot of people are saying,” Bolt asked, not mentioning the unprecedented bushfires, floods, sea level rises or the basic physics of the greenhouse effect. Dutton said: “If it was limited to just environmental issues or climate change then it would be bad enough. “The extremism of some of the teachers and the language that they use and the approach that they take … But it’s across a broad range of public policy areas.” Dutton said he wanted to “shine a light” on the issue and teachers should be able to “stick to the facts”, claiming “many teachers out there are incredibly frustrated by what’s taking place”. Prof Amy Cutter-Mackenzie, the dean of Southern Cross University’s faculty of education and an expert in environmental education, says Dutton’s words don’t ring true. “That is not a perspective I am hearing. In fact, I have not heard that from anyone in the educational community,” she tells Temperature Check. “Children are so far beyond whether climate change is human induced or not. “The suggestion teachers are scaremongering with the curriculum is utterly false. It’s not about scaremongering. It’s about understanding the world.” Going nuclear In the Australian newspaper, commentator Claire Lehmann was out advocating for “small modular nuclear reactors”. This sounds neat and tidy but the phrase covers a vast array of theoretical approaches and designs to build small nuclear power plants. The World Nuclear Association lists only five small reactors currently operating. In her advocacy, Lehmann claimed that while many environmentalists were opposed to nuclear power, they ignored that solar panels could “leak toxic heavy metals” and that wind turbines were responsible for “killing large numbers” of native birds. The number of birds that die from flying into windows, or being eaten by cats, dwarfs the small number that die when they fly into turbine blades. But Lehmann’s complaints about the potential for solar panels to leak while advocating for nuclear energy was unfortunately timed. She wasn’t to know that just days later a study would appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggesting that any future development and deployment of small modular reactors would “increase the volume of nuclear waste in need of management and disposal by factors of 2 to 30”, depending on the design."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/19/uk-net-zero-report-recommendations-and-conclusions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T15:00:12Z","webTitle":"UK net zero report: what are its recommendations and conclusions?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/19/uk-net-zero-report-recommendations-and-conclusions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/19/uk-net-zero-report-recommendations-and-conclusions","fields":{"headline":"UK net zero report: what are its recommendations and conclusions?","bodyText":"What was in the net zero review? Chris Skidmore, the head of the government’s net zero review, said he aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the UK’s net zero ambitions. The 323-page net zero review covers the whole of the UK’s economy, as well as the impacts on individuals and communities. Everything from the funding for net zero schemes to the need for regulation, parliamentary scrutiny, data, and research and development is examined, along with sectors of the economy from energy and transport to housing and farming. There are 130 recommendations, ranging from the highly specific, such as bringing forward the end of routine flaring by oil and gas companies from 2030 to 2025, to vaguer hopes, such as central and local government working more closely together. Some of the main recommendations cover: Energy The government should consider replacing the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas with a net zero fund that ringfences the proceeds for investment in offshore wind and other low-CO2 projects. Nuclear power should have a clear strategy, and the government must “double down on achieving the UK’s nuclear baseload requirement”, including small modular reactors and “a fleet of projects”, though the review does not specify how many new power stations should be built. Hydrogen should have a 10-year delivery plan, set out by the end of this year, that will require decisions on funding and technology, including hydrogen for home heating. Ministers should also “consider” requiring fossil fuel producers to “take back” the CO2 produced from burning their fuels, by storing 10% of it underground, using carbon capture and storage technology. Ofgem’s remit should be expanded to include the net zero target. Homes The boiler upgrade scheme should be extended, and people given incentives to buy heat pumps. Skidmore publicly called for “a rooftop revolution”, though some of the recommendations are slightly weaker – for instance, that there should be a consultation on whether new homes should be fitted with solar panels, and a supply chain built up for renewables. Farming Environmental land management schemes, the replacement for the EU farm subsidy system, should be laid out in detail this year, the review recommends, which will come as a relief to farmers concerned about the vagueness of current government plans. Nature-based solutions, which help to increase the UK’s carbon sinks, should also be encouraged. The review also calls for a biomass strategy, without setting out what should be in it. Research and development By this autumn, the government should set out how to create incentives for research and development into new low-CO2 technologies. Three new demonstrator projects should be established. Finance The UK could become “the most competitive financial centre” for raising capital for the green transition, so the government should review opportunities for the banking sector and how to encourage investment. There should also be clear rules on how companies should report their climate impacts. What was missing? Onshore wind and solar farms The review suggests taskforces should be set up for the deployment of onshore wind and solar power, rather than calling for clear targets on onshore windfarms and solar farms in England. These have been controversial questions, as some Tory MPs are opposed to onshore windfarms – despite widespread public support for them – and solar farms. Insulation and home heating Although home heating accounts for 14% of the UK’s emissions, and is one of the biggest cost-of-living concerns amid soaring gas prices, the review stops well short of recommending the sort of nationwide house-by-house programme of upgrades that campaigners have been calling for, or setting out clear options on how to encourage homeowners to upgrade their energy efficiency. No new gas boilers should be installed from 2033, the review said, but that is just two years earlier than the government’s current target of 2035. Those hoping for a clear endorsement of hydrogen for home heating, however – which some hydrogen companies and Tory MPs want but which economists and energy experts say is uneconomic and physically unviable – will also have been disappointed. While not ruling out hydrogen for home heating, the review is notably lukewarm: by the end of this year, the government should update its analysis of hydrogen for home heating “to ensure that the case for economic optimality and feasibility still holds”. Behaviour change To meet the UK’s net zero targets, people will have to change their behaviour, from driving less to eating less meat. These changes should be healthier and better for most of us, but they will require some effort. There are recommendations on eco-labelling and a CO2 calculator for consumers, but beyond that, the review has nothing to say on how consumer behaviour should change, or how the government should encourage behaviour change. Transport Emissions from transport have scarcely budged in a decade, and it is now the biggest single contributor to the UK’s carbon footprint. Yet the review gives a scant five recommendations on the issue, two of which are for shipping and aviation. Public transport merits not a single recommendation, reflecting the absence of government strategy on the subject. On electric vehicles, the report recommends equalising VAT on public and private electric vehicle chargings – useful, perhaps, but not likely to have any significant impact. Meanwhile, why is there is no mention of the rollout of a nationwide system of charging points experts say is needed? Verdict What seeks to be a comprehensive review actually contains huge gaps, reflecting the Tory party’s seeming paralysis over basic issues that need to be grasped, from finding a way to finance the insulation British housing desperately needs, to building out onshore wind, and the absence of any real plan for transport or behaviour change. As a basis for action, this report passes too many bucks to be truly effective – but as an assessment of the government’s failures by a party loyalist, it is devastating."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2023/apr/03/travel-back-in-time-six-of-britains-best-heritage-railways","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-03T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"‘Travel back in time’: six of Britain’s best heritage railways","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/apr/03/travel-back-in-time-six-of-britains-best-heritage-railways","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2023/apr/03/travel-back-in-time-six-of-britains-best-heritage-railways","fields":{"headline":"‘Travel back in time’: six of Britain’s best heritage railways","bodyText":"This year marks the centenary of Britain’s top mechanical celebrity: the Flying Scotsman locomotive. It emerged from the Doncaster works of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923 and is celebrating its anniversary with an exhibition at the National Railway Museum in York, special excursions and visits to heritage railways around the country. Scotsman is often described as an icon, but what exactly does it represent? I would say early British PR. There were Flying Scotsman ashtrays, jigsaws and paperweights – and the loco often hauled the train of nearly the same name, the Flying Scotsman (train names being preceded by the definite article), which was glamourised by the LNER, with its onboard barber, cinema carriage and Louis XIV-style restaurant car. But why all the glitz? The LNER, like most showoffs, was insecure. The main transport trend during the interwar heyday of the Flying Scotsman was the rise of the internal combustion engine. For the first time, trains were not necessarily top dog in the transport world, hence the paranoid slogan that began to appear on LNER posters: “It’s Quicker By Rail”. As Bob Gwynne, author of a book on the loco, puts it: “The Scotsman campaign was partly meant to lend a warm glow to the railways in general.” In that sense, the Flying Scotsman was an anti-car icon, which gives it in retrospect environmental credibility. And while most of its centenary events are sold out, you can see evidence of the railways’ historical battle against the roads on any visit to Britain’s heritage railways. North Yorkshire Moors Railway The NYMR is – like many heritage railways – a line restored by volunteers after being closed by Dr Richard Beeching in the 1960s. Beeching was installed as British Railways chairman by the Conservative transport minister Ernest “Ernie” Marples – a veritable Dick Dastardly, if you’re a rail fan. Marples drove a Jag and founded a company that built roads. He encouraged Beeching (a physicist) to take a “scientific” approach to Britain’s railways, which turned out to mean slashing the network by a third without regard for the utility of a line, or indeed its beauty – and the one through the wild North York Moors from Whitby to Pickering was particularly beautiful. Eighteen miles of it – from Grosmont to Pickering – were reopened in 1966, and the NYMR runs some luxurious teak carriages hauled by the old LNER expresses, including one that featured on The Flying Scotsman train. These carriages, with their art deco mirrors and plush seats, were boudoir-like to seduce wealthy business travellers away from the new trunk roads. Their mellow, tawny interiors are complemented by the russet shades of the hillside bracken in winter or a moorland sunset at any time of year. The NYMR runs specially adapted steam trains from Grosmont to the gracious, waterfront station at Whitby, which is on the national network. Strathspey Railway Aviemore’s pretty chalet-like station is on the Highland main line. But there’s a very prominent petrol station nearby, and on a sunny day the town, with its low-rise architecture and wide car parks under big skies, has something of an LA feel about it – a reminder that the Highlands are a magnet for motorists. Since 1978, the Strathspey Railway – which revives a stretch of the old Perth-Inverness (via Aviemore) line closed by Beeching – has been a corrective to that. The line runs through the Cairngorms national park, and the SR website states: “We are delighted to welcome customers with bicycles or dogs.” When I was last on platform 3 of Aviemore station, where the SR is based, there were plenty of both, sometimes with a fishing rod thrown in. As our journey began, the adjacent fields and woods of birch or pine were sun-dappled, but a purplish haze over the Cairngorms to the west indicated heavy rain. “Oh,” said the train guard, “there’s usually about five types of weather going on there at once.” Swanage Railway Beeching had it in for lines to seaside resorts, whose ridership was minimal in the off season. The pretty line to Swanage in Dorset via Corfe Castle appeared to have dodged his axe, but it closed in 1972. It reopened in stages from 1979, the volunteers having to fight off a road expansion scheme. Victorian Swanage was “made” by the railway, and the alliance has been restored. You can’t see the sea from the station but you can hear it when it’s rough, and when it’s calm the genteel station announcements are audible from much of the town. In BR Southern Region green, the station is redolent of that 1950s seaside innocence that Beeching assailed. It displays vintage posters featuring bathing beauties with permed hair and slogans aimed at the automotive enemy: “Arrive Earlier by Train”. Some SR services connect to Wareham on the national network. Ecclesbourne Valley Railway The Ecclesbourne Valley line in Derbyshire closed to passengers in 1947, but the track was used to test diesel multiple units, seen as key to the cheap operation of country branches being menaced by cars. Today, the star attraction of the EVR (reopened in 2002) is a single unit from the first generation of those early diesels – the Derby Lightweights, which are as endearing as their name suggests. The unit is dark green, with straw-coloured “speed whiskers” painted on the front – a kind of go-faster stripe that actually suggests the moustache of a dandified old man. The seat coverings are a lovely, paler green, and all this verdancy harmonises restfully with the gently rolling hillsides and the small but dignified Victorian stations. The EVR shares Duffield station with the somewhat brasher units of the Midland main line. Kent and East Sussex Railway This line opened in 1900, serving farms. It closed in 1961 and was revived from 1974. It was a “Colonel Stephens railway”, meaning it was part of the empire of country lines built on the cheap by the maverick Colonel Holman Fred Stephens. A typical Stephens line was not fenced off but would just wander through a field. A station might be nothing more than an old carriage; signals were usually dispensed with. At its Tenterden terminus (accessible by bus from Ashford or Headcorn mainline stations), the K&amp;ES has a fascinating museum dedicated to the colonel. There’s a waxwork of him sitting at his desk – a hawklike, formidably moustachioed man. He looked like a cad, but he fought the good fight – against the car. Posters around the K&amp;ES carry his peremptory slogans: “Travel in safety across the country, away from the dusty and crowded roads”, or simply: “Travel back in time”. You can do just that on the trains of the K&amp;ES, which are no more disruptive of the sleepy Kentish Weald than the adjacent River Rother. Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway As mentioned, most of the Scotsman centenary events are sold out – but if you travel to the RH&amp;D in Kent (accessible by bus from Folkestone, Ashford or Canterbury), you can see some 1920s locos modelled after Scotsman, but one-third the size. One is called Green Goddess, another Southern Maid. You might see their drivers polishing their boilers prior to setting off from Hythe, running behind sea-facing bungalows towards the great grey beach (and nuclear power stations) at Dungeness – a setting that makes this 15-inch gauge line even more dreamlike. The question of whether it is a heritage railway is moot, since it has been operating more or less continuously since 1927 and it’s not just a pleasure line. Local people can buy shares in the railway, thus getting discounted travel for car-free shopping in Hythe. So even though it was founded by a motor racing enthusiast, Captain Jack Howey, the RH&amp;D fights the good fight.

In total, more than 6 million subscribers,” Zelensky said in his nightly address on Friday. The number of affected households had reduced “by half” since Wednesday. He said about 600,000 people were experiencing power cuts in Kyiv, the capital, with the Odessa, Lviv, Vinnytsia and Dnipropetrovsk regions also among the worst affected as temperatures approach freezing. The European Union will step up efforts to provide Ukraine with support to restore and maintain power and heating, the head of the European Commission said on Friday. Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement after a phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the EU executive arm was preparing the delivery to Ukraine large donations from EU countries and from the EC’s reserves. Russian shelling on the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson killed 15 civilians on Friday, officials said, as engineers across the country sought to restore heat, water and power to major cities. Several “private houses and high-rise buildings” had been damaged, city official Galyna Lugova also said. The shelling of Kherson, a key eastern city recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces, was the deadliest Russian bombardment in recent days. Yarovslav Yanushovich, head of the Kherson military administration, said Russian forces “opened fire on a residential area with multiple rocket launchers”. Hungary’s President Katalin Novak is travelling to Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy, her Ukrainian counterpart, the website index.hu reported on Friday, adding that Novak would go by train via Poland. The Hungarian president’s office said it would neither deny nor confirm the information. Novak, a close ally of the nationalist prime minister Viktor Orban, would be the highest-ranking Hungarian politician to visit Zelenskiy since Russia’s invasion in February. Ukraine’s leaders would have to be “far-sighted” to secure peace, Pope Francis said, suggesting Kyiv would have to make concessions to end the war with Russia. In an open letter released on Friday to mark the war’s nine-month anniversary, the pontiff praised the strength of Ukrainians in the face of the onslaught. “The world has recognised a bold and strong people, a people that suffers and prays, cries and struggles, resists and hopes: a noble and martyred people.” Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants have been reconnected to the national power grid after completely losing off-site power earlier this week, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. The facilities were all disconnected from the grid on Wednesday for the first time in Ukrainian history after the latest wave of Russian air strikes on vital infrastructure. In a statement on Friday, the nuclear watchdog said Ukraine had informed it on Friday that its Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyy plants had been reconnected. Ukraine reconnected its vast Zaporizhzhia plant on Thursday, Kyiv said earlier. Armenia has asked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to chair peace talks with Azerbaijan in a fresh challenge to Vladimir Putin’s increasingly loose grip on Russia’s regional allies in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The snub from a traditional ally to Putin comes immediately on the back of his disastrous summit with six former Soviet states. EU diplomats were meeting on Friday night in an effort to reach a deal on a price level at which to cap Russian oil exports, according to a report by Bloomberg. European governments have failed so far to find an agreement ahead of a 5 December deadline. A G7 proposal for a cap of $65-$70 a barrel is seen as far too high by some, and too low by others. Angela Merkel has insisted that her position as a lame duck in the last months of her time in office made it more or less impossible for her to influence the behaviour of Vladimir Putin. The former German chancellor appeared defensive and quietly defiant about her inability to change the course of the Russian president’s decision-making in the run-up to the invasion of Ukraine, telling German news magazine Spiegel she felt acutely aware that her ability to negotiate with Putin was minimal because it was known she would not stand for a fifth term. The head of the Russian mercenary outfit Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has claimed a former US Marine general is working for the group. In response to a request for comment from Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, Prigozhin said on Friday: “There are not very many Finnish citizens in the Wagner PMC, about 20 people … They are fighting in a British battalion [as part of Wagner PMC] which is commanded by a US citizen, a former general of the Marine Corps,” Prigozhin said, as quoted by the press service of his company Concord.

Although a communist and long-time member of CND, he worked on many sensitive international nuclear power projects. He was also an expert in soil science, an academic and a bon vivant. Born in Bolton, Lancashire, to Sydney Skipp, a pattern maker, and his wife, Hilda, Bryan attended Bolton boys’ school. His parents, both Methodists, wanted him to go into the ministry but he soon declared himself an atheist. Instead of doing national service, Bryan spent several years as a miner in Cannock, Staffordshire, and then studied mining engineering at the University of Birmingham, graduating in 1953. It was an influential time in his life. While at Birmingham, George Derwent Thomson, then a professor there, mentored Bryan into communism. After graduating he went to Paris, where he gained a PhD from the Ecole des Mines. He became a fellow of the Geological Society in 1956, aged 26. Following his PhD, Bryan started a lifetime job at the engineering consultancy Soil Mechanics, part of the Mowlem organisation. He became an international authority on soil science, but was also involved in civil engineering projects, such as power station demolitions. He published more than 70 papers in academic journals and was a visiting lecturer and examiner at Imperial College London, for more than 30 years. In the 1960s Bryan married and divorced. A child of his marriage, Gerrard, died of misadventure aged 14. In 1970 he met my mother, Maria Tsaneva, at an engineering conference in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. They married in 1972 and we all moved to London. I was 15 at the time. Bryan made sure we adapted to the British way of life – Indian cooking, Royal Society of Arts debates, noisy street politics and sailing in his boat, Cyranka. We all became involved with the British-Bulgarian Society and Bryan was a dedicated member. Though lavish and frequent entertainers, Bryan and Maria never had a car and we lived in a small flat in Brixton. He also threw himself into south London life, volunteering at the Angell Road adventure playground, the Gresham Centre youth club and for Lambeth Council for Community Relations. His career flourished while his communist principles never faltered. On occasion, when Bryan was the only person for a job with the relevant skills and expertise, he would loudly proclaim his politics lest someone later point an accusing finger at him for gathering secrets while being a communist and a CND-er. Thus he worked on nuclear power station sitings, nuclear submarine berths and nuclear waste disposal. Bryan retired at the close of 1994 but went on to work as consultant for 15 years. In the late 1990s he was among an international multidisciplinary delegation that surveyed the crumbling original Chernobyl power station “sarcophagus” and advised on the construction of a new protective shell. In the early 2000s he was involved in helping to devise an international standard on earthquake-resistant structures, under the aegis of the British Standards Institution. Maria died in 2015.

Maybe he didn’t mean Ukrainians, because he hadn’t refreshed his browser? Maybe he meant Syrians, 621,000 of whom were given sanctuary by Germany; 29,000 by the UK. Nope. Or maybe he said it by accident? But then he said it again, and again. Could it have been a straight lie? A dicey move, in parliament. Not exactly: he was referring to the number of people taken in under a resettlement scheme over the past seven years, in which the UK numbers do surpass other nations’. Overall, our figures are absolutely dwarfed by even much smaller neighbours. The same old prime minister arrived in parliament, in other words, with the same old manoeuvre of turning something technically true into an untruth by stripping it of context. But it’s not the same old world any more. When you stand up and deliberately mislead, call the worst the best, turn facts on their head, it all sounds a bit Putin-esque. He had another couple of lines – that he didn’t believe in letting refugees in without checks, and that Conservatives must be humane and have sanctuary in their blood, because look how many on its frontbench were descended from refugees. Those were both weaker, but less murderous-dictator-adjacent. So many members, from so many parties, stood up to challenge Johnson on the UK’s response to the refugee crisis. The SNP’s Ian Blackford gave a persuasive and workmanlike rundown of how far short we were falling. Ed Davey got Johnson on the hop, as he found himself rattling through the UK visa centres in eastern Europe, muffling one city into another in frantic underenunciation. One of the most affecting speakers was from the Tory benches, Julian Smith, whose voice quavered slightly as he asked when his own party was going to show some humanity. Keir Starmer went another way, as they say in casting: the chancellor’s measures on fuel bills were nothing like enough to meet the situation, so “when will the prime minister force the chancellor to U-turn?” It was a peculiar angle, dispersing the fault between Johnson and Sunak, and ham-fistedly obvious about not expecting an answer. But it transpired to be just some fancy footwork before his main attack: BP has made £9.5bn out of prices that were surging even before Ukraine, and Shell made £14bn, “in their own words”, said Starmer, “more money than they know what to do with”. His call for a windfall tax on energy company profits is probably as close to popular radicalism as he’s prepared to sail. Johnson replied that, if you tax these corporations, they will just pass that cost on to the consumer. It was ironic that they had a pointless barney about nuclear power right after (a leader who has built no nuclear power stations, accusing an opponent who’s never been in government of failing to build nuclear power stations). That answer on windfall tax – what’s the point of taxing companies, when the consumer will always pay? – is radioactive for Johnson. It will sound worse and worse, as fuel bills rise. Perhaps it was because he realised this that Johnson started mangling his words, or perhaps in some corner of his limbic brain, he thought that accelerating his speech would make the time go faster. He figured out eventually that it was the other way around. Starmer has found a laddish mojo in his responses, all “come off it” and “does he expect us to buy that?” Two questions from Johnson’s backbenchers were downright peculiar. Greg Clark, the MP for Tunbridge Wells, asked if the prime minister would like to join him in wishing a happy birthday to the second world war veteran Colin Bell. Why yes, Boris Johnson would love to do that. His answer was so baggy, his relief so audible, he sounded a breath away from launching into the song. Richard Holden, the MP for North West Durham, wanted to know whether, when his constituency’s new cottage hospital was built, the prime minister would grant him the honour of opening it? It’s nothing new for a backbench chancer in a hurry to lob an asinine question to give some rhetorical respite to a flailing leader, but these were on a whole new level, reaching for desperate patriotic bass notes, promising photo ops and, who knows, maybe a dressing up opportunity, as if dealing with a … well, maybe not an autocrat: but autocrat-adjacent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-drone-strike-on-kyiv-uk-to-announce-new-artillery-package","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-19T19:00:15Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: UN chief believes war in Ukraine ‘will go on’; Putin in Belarus for talks with Lukashenko – as it happened ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-drone-strike-on-kyiv-uk-to-announce-new-artillery-package","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-drone-strike-on-kyiv-uk-to-announce-new-artillery-package","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: UN chief believes war in Ukraine ‘will go on’; Putin in Belarus for talks with Lukashenko – as it happened ","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has travelled to Belarus to meet the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. Putin described the talks as “very productive” and insisted that Russia has no interest in “absorbing” anyone, adding that unspecified “enemies” wanted to stop Russia’s integration with Belarus. Lukashenko said high level Belarusian-Russian negotiations covered “the entire range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations”. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk earlier today ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk. The foreign ministers discussed “specific topical issues, the efforts to counter the illegal sanctions of the West, as well as interaction on international platforms”, Belarusian state media cited Belarus’s foreign ministry as saying, as well as having “touched upon trade and economic cooperation matters and the implementation of joint projects”. Belarus’s defence ministry said it had completed a series of inspections of its armed forces’ military preparedness, hours ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk. Weeks of military manoeuvres and inspections have raised fears in Kyiv that Belarus, which acted as a staging post for Russia to launch its invasion of Ukraine in February, could be preparing to take a more active role in the conflict once again. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally. “Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus, is our constant priority,” Zelenskiy said on Sunday after a meeting with Ukraine’s top military command. “We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios.” The exiled Belarus opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has warned that the chances of Minsk sending soldiers into Ukraine “may increase in coming weeks”. Kyiv was “right to prepare” for Minsk to join Moscow’s new offensive because the probability “might increase in coming weeks”, Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with Kyiv Post. The head of Moldova’s security service, Alexandru Musteata, has warned of a “very high” risk of a new Russian offensive towards his country’s east. Russia still aims to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, Musteata said, adding that his agency believed Moscow was looking at several scenarios to reach Moldova and that it was possible an offensive would be launched in January-February or later in March-April. A Russian drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba said. Russia unleashed 35 “kamikaze” drones on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday as many people slept, hitting critical infrastructure in and around Kyiv in Moscow’s third air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days. Ukraine’s atomic energy agency accused Russia of flouting nuclear safety by sending a “kamikaze” drone over part of a nuclear power plant in Mykolaiv region just after Sunday midnight. Energoatom said the Iranian-made Shahed drone had been detected over the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant, and called on the international nuclear community to protect atomic sites from the risks of war. Air raid alerts were issued across Kyiv and most of Ukraine on Monday early afternoon, officials said. There were no immediate reports of attacks and the alarm was ended about 20 minutes after the alert. Ukraine’s air force said it had shot down 30 out of 35 Russian-launched Shahed drones overnight. The Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 kamikaze drones were reportedly launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov, the force added. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had shot down four US-made HARM anti-radiation missiles over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, in the space of 24 hours, the state-run TASS news agency reported. One person died and several were injured by Ukrainian shelling in the region on Sunday morning, the region’s governor said. Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut in the country’s eastern Donetsk region, according to Zelenskiy. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national address. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.” The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said he believes Russia’s war in Ukraine “will go on” and does not see a prospect for “serious” peace talks in the immediate future. Speaking to reporters during his annual end-of-year conference in New York, Guterres said he “strongly hoped that peace could be reached in 2023, citing the “consequences” for Ukraine’s people, Russian society and the global economy if a deal is not found Rishi Sunak said that the west should reject unilateral calls by the Kremlin for a ceasefire in Ukraine and focus on “degrading Russia’s capability to regroup and to resupply” at a meeting of European leaders in Latvia. The UK prime minister was speaking at a summit of the 10-country Joint Expeditionary Force in the Latvian capital at a time of heightened concern as to whether Britain will continue the robust support for Ukraine that began under Boris Johnson. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked western leaders meeting in Latvia to ramp up the supply of a wide range of weapons systems to his country. He called on leaders “to do everything to accelerate the defeat” of Russia, and said supplying air defence systems to Kyiv would be “one of the most successful steps against Russian aggression and this step is required right now”. EU ministers have agreed a plan to cap the price of gas, ending months of argument over how to handle the cost of soaring energy prices after Russia cut gas supplies to Europe. A gas price cap will kick in if prices on the main European gas exchange, the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF), exceed €180 (£157) a megawatt-hour for three consecutive working days, far lower than the European Commission’s original proposal of €275 a MWh, which had been derided by cap-supporting countries as a joke. The Canadian government has announced plans to seize $26m in sanctioned assets from the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, with the proceeds from the forfeiture to go towards reconstruction in Ukraine and compensation of victims of the Russian invasion. The move marked the first case of the Canadian government using new powers to pursue the seizure of assets belonging to sanctioned individuals, it said in a statement. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thank you for reading. Vladimir Putin has described Russian-Belarusian talks in Minsk as “very productive” after his one-on-one meeting with Alexander Lukashenko, Belarusian state media reported. Speaking to reporters at a joint press conference with his Belarusian counterpart, Putin insisted that Russia has no interest in “absorbing” anyone, and that unspecified “enemies” wanted to stop Russia’s integration with Belarus. The future of Belarusian and Russian peoples “is being determined now”, Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta cited President Lukashenko as saying. He added: Today we can unequivocally state: together we were able not only to survive, but also to find opportunities for the development of our economies. He said negotiations of the two leaders with larger government delegations in Minsk had been productive, and said they discussed “the entire range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations”, according to Belta. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said he believes Russia’s war in Ukraine “will go on” and does not see a prospect for “serious” peace talks in the immediate future. Speaking to reporters during his annual end-of-year conference in New York, Guterres said he “will not relent in the pursuit of peace in Ukraine in line with international law and the United Nations Charter”, referring to the UN charter’s key principle of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. He said he was “not optimistic” about the possibility of effective Ukraine and Russia peace talks in the immediate future, adding: I do believe that the military confrontation will go on. Nevertheless, he said he “strongly hoped that peace could be reached in 2023, citing the “consequences” for Ukraine’s people, Russian society and the global economy if a deal is not found. He added: All these are reasons for us to do everything possible to make a peace solution happen before the end of 2023. In the meantime, he said he would focus on increasing the efficiency of a UN-brokered deal that resumed Ukraine’s Black Sea food and fertiliser shipments, continue to try to restart the export of Russian ammonia via Ukraine and seek to accelerate the exchange of prisoners of war. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Minsk, where Russia’s president Vladimir Putin has been holding talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko. The head of Moldova’s security service, Alexandru Musteata, has warned of a “very high” risk of a new Russian offensive towards his country’s east, echoing recent messages from several Ukrainian military commanders that Moscow is preparing for a major new offensive early next year. Russia still aims to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, Musteata told the TVR-Moldova television channel, as reported by Reuters. Musteata said: The question is not whether the Russian Federation will undertake a new advance towards Moldova’s territory, but when it will do so. He said his agency believed Moscow was looking at several scenarios to reach Moldova and that it was possible an offensive would be launched in January-February or later in March-April. Transnistria, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists and permanently hosts 1,500 Russian troops as well as a large arms depot, borders western Ukraine. Musteata said Russia wanted its forces to link up with those forces in Transnistria. Boris Johnson’s Ukraine policy may not have always been sophisticated – “Dobryi den, everybody!” – but his enthusiasm was welcomed in Kyiv. Six months of Conservative party chaos later, his successor but one, Rishi Sunak, is yet to demonstrate he is as supportive at a time when Ukraine needs the west to dig in. A leak at the start of the weekend said that Sunak had ordered an internal assessment of the significance of British military aid to Ukraine. Revelation of the Whitehall exercise was accompanied by a pointed briefing to the BBC, accusing the prime minister of resorting to a “Goldman Sachs dashboard” approach. “Wars aren’t won [by dashboards]. Wars are won on instinct,” the critic continued – a demonstration that cracks are appearing in Britain’s policy towards Ukraine. Downing Street may have rejected that characterisation on Monday, but a Ukraine review is on. “The PM is staying closely across the detail of developments in Ukraine and the impact of UK and international support,” a spokesperson said. “To ensure we are delivering the best possible assistance.” It is also no secret in Westminster that Sunak and his defence secretary, Ben Wallace, are not close. Wallace has been the ever present in Britain’s Ukraine policy, but also a long-term supporter of Johnson who then backed the ill-fated Liz Truss and flirted with backing Johnson in an unlikely comeback against Sunak. Read the full story here: EU ministers have reached an agreement to cap gas prices, after weeks of talks and despite concerns that such an intervention could cause greater volatility in the market. Ministers agreed to trigger a cap if prices on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub’s front-month contract exceed €180 (£157) per megawatt hour for three days. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said the deal “means the end of market manipulation” by Russia and its energy giant Gazprom. The European Commission stands ready to suspend the agreed price cap if an analysis by regulators shows the risks of the measure outweigh the benefits, the bloc’s energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, told reporters. The exiled Belarus opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has warned that the chances of Minsk sending soldiers into Ukraine “may increase in coming weeks” as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing for its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. Tsikhanouskaya’s remarks came as Vladimir Putin travelled to Belarus for talks with Alexander Lukashenko, a meeting that the Belarusian president said would cover the “military-political situation” in the region as well as economic cooperation. Ukraine will be closely monitoring the talks. Last week, several Ukrainian military commanders said Russia might try another attempt at invading the country from the north. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that Ukraine was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally. Kyiv was “right to prepare” for Minsk to join Moscow’s new offensive because the probability “might increase in coming weeks”, Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with Kyiv Post. She said: Belarusian armed forces are part of the society and share the same view on the war – 86% of Belarusians are against participation in the war. This has stopped the order to send Belarusian troops to the battlefield in Ukraine. It was not a good will of dictators or Lukashenko’s standing up to Putin – he is fully on the Kremlin’s side. However, the probability of such an order remains and might increase in coming weeks. I think the Ukrainian leadership is right to prepare for this scenario even though it means distracting significant forces from active war zones in the south-east. Lukashenko “sees Ukraine as a threat”, she said, adding that “a democratic, free, European Ukraine is a bad example to the dictatorships of Lukashenko and Putin, therefore this war is a logical decision for them.” Asked what Russia and Belarus’ join aim might be, she replied: To destroy Ukraine, its European aspirations and national identity, and bring it under their control. The Canadian government has announced plans to seize $26m in sanctioned assets from the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, with the proceeds from the forfeiture to go towards reconstruction in Ukraine and compensation of victims of the Russian invasion. The move marked the first case of the Canadian government using new powers to pursue the seizure of assets belonging to sanctioned individuals, it said in a statement. Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, said the government would “continue to pressure the Russian regime and those who have benefited from Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine”. It’s 6.15pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has travelled to Belarus to meet the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. In the run-up to the meeting, which will be Putin’s first visit to Belarus since 2019, Lukashenko said the two leaders would discuss the “military-political situation” in the region as well as economic cooperation. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk earlier today ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk.

Steffen Hebestreit said there was a possibility that Belarus could ramp up aid to the Russian army, but warned to wait for the results of the talks and not to draw any conclusions in advance. A Russian drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba said.

In recent months, the group had developed offensive tactics to make use of the large number of poorly trained convicts it has recruited, the ministry noted in its latest intelligence report. Rishi Sunak said that the west should reject unilateral calls by the Kremlin for a ceasefire in Ukraine and focus on “degrading Russia’s capability to regroup and to resupply” at a meeting of European leaders in Latvia. The UK prime minister was speaking at a summit of the 10-country Joint Expeditionary Force in the Latvian capital at a time of heightened concern as to whether Britain will continue the robust support for Ukraine that began under Boris Johnson.

He called on leaders “to do everything to accelerate the defeat” of Russia, and said supplying air defence systems to Kyiv would be “one of the most successful steps against Russian aggression and this step is required right now”. Germany has “concerns” about Vladimir Putin’s visit to Belarus and whether talks between the Russian leader and his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, will affect Minsk’s role in the war in Ukraine, a German government spokesperson said. Speaking at a briefing this afternoon, Steffen Hebestreit told reporters that Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, was fully aware of Putin’s visit to Belarus today, Ukraine’s state-run news agency Ukrinform reported. Hebestreit said: Of course, there are concerns about what this visit might entail: whether the role of Belarus in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine will once again change or be modified. He said there was a possibility that Belarus could ramp up aid to the Russian army, but warned to wait for the results of the talks and not to draw any conclusions in advance. EU energy ministers have agreed to a gas price cap, a spokesperson for the Czech presidency of the EU, Dmitrij Černikov, has said. Vladimir Putin said Belarus was Russia’s closest ally in brief remarks during visit to Minsk to hold talks with Alexander Lukashenko. The Belarusian media outlet Nexta has a clip of the Russian and Belarusian presidents as they began the open part of their negotiations. In comments published by Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass, Putin said Moscow was ready to continue helping Minsk to develop its nuclear industry. Putin was quoted as saying at talks with Lukashenko: We are intensively working in almost all areas. In the energy sector – as we noted with [Belarusian president] Alexander Grigorievich [Lukashenko], Russia, to its own detriment, nevertheless continues the nuclear project – we are building a nuclear power plant. A resident walks past a damaged house following a barrage of drone strikes from Russia in Stari Bezradychi village, Kyiv region. Rishi Sunak praised the 10-country Joint Expeditionary Force’s support of Ukraine as “heartening” in a meeting with Latvia’s prime minister. Speaking at the start of their bilateral at the close of the alliance’s summit in Riga, the UK prime minister told Krišjānis Kariņš: To have a group of partners and allies who think so alike on these incredibly important questions of our connected security, and then are backing up those sentiments with action when it comes to supporting Ukraine, I think is very heartening. Kariņš replied: I think you nailed it when you made that comment to all of us around the table: ‘it’s not just talk, it’s also the walk’. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine’s Kyiv region, in the aftermath of a Russian drone attack in the early hours of Monday. Ukraine’s atomic energy agency has accused Russia of flouting nuclear safety by sending a “kamikaze” drone over part of a nuclear power plant in Mykolaiv region just after midnight. Writing on Telegram, Energoatom said the Iranian-made Shahed drone had been detected early Monday over the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant. Energoatom said: This is an absolutely unacceptable violation of nuclear and radiation safety. The agency called on the international nuclear community to protect atomic sites from the risks of war. It has been possible to independently verify these claims. Vladimir Putin has landed in Minsk for talks with the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, Russian state media reported, amid growing fears that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. The Russian leader’s trip will be his first to Minsk since 2019, and comes as he has been taking a more public role in his war in Ukraine. Lukashenko has previously allowed the Kremlin to use his country as a platform to send tens of thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine, while Russian war jets have taken off from Belarusian bases. But Lukashenko has not joined the war directly or sent his own troops into the fight, at times even subtly criticising the invasion, saying he felt the conflict was “dragging on”. Speaking to Russian news agencies, the Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Belarus was Russia’s “number one ally”, but that suggestions that Moscow wanted to pressure Minsk into joining what it calls its “special military operation” were “stupid and unfounded fabrications”. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk earlier today ahead of President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Belarus. The foreign ministers discussed “specific topical issues, the efforts to counter the illegal sanctions of the West, as well as interaction on international platforms”, Belarusian state media cited Belarus’ foreign ministry as saying. The pair also “touched upon trade and economic cooperation matters and the implementation of joint projects”, the ministry said. Rishi Sunak said that the west should reject unilateral calls by the Kremlin for a ceasefire in Ukraine and focus on “degrading Russia’s capability to regroup and to resupply” at a meeting of European leaders in Latvia. The UK prime minister was speaking at a summit of the 10-country Joint Expeditionary Force in the Latvian capital at a time of heightened concern as to whether Britain will continue the robust support for Ukraine that began under Boris Johnson. Rejecting Russian-promoted ceasefires has been the west’s position for some time – but reiterations of the position are welcome in Kyiv, given its anxiety that the west could eventually lose interest in the war in Ukraine and slow the supply of weapons the country so badly needs. A call to prevent Russia from regrouping indicates Britain endorses Ukraine’s ongoing counter offensive, and comes the morning after the UK said it would ship hundreds of thousands more of artillery shells to Kyiv, under a £250m contract. EU energy ministers are meeting in Brussels today to attempt to agree to a cap on gas prices, following months of debate without agreement despite two emergency meetings. Ministers are considering a new compromise proposed by the Czech Republic, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, according to Reuters. In the draft proposal, a cap would be triggered if prices on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub’s front-month contract exceed €180 (£157) per megawatt hour for three days. The figure in the draft proposal, seen by the news agency, is far lower than the €275/MWh originally proposed by the European Commission last month, which about a dozen countries including Belgium, Poland and Greece had dismissed as too high. Pro-cap countries say the cap must be below €200/MWh to tackle the high gas prices that have inflated citizens’ energy bills and stoked record-high inflation. But Germany, the Netherlands and Austria oppose the cap, which they say could disrupt Europe’s energy markets and divert much-needed gas cargoes away from the EU and to other regions. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, travels to Belarus on Monday to meet the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. In the run-up to the meeting, which will be Putin’s first visit to Belarus since 2019, Lukashenko said that the two leaders would discuss the “military-political situation” in the region as well as economic cooperation. The longtime Belarusian strongman, who oversaw a violent crackdown on anti-government protesters in 2020, stressed that his country’s “sovereignty and independence” was not up for debate, as observers believe that Putin’s visit serves to pull Belarus into the war in Ukraine. “I would like to emphasise this feature once again: no one, except us, governs Belarus,” Lukashenko said in a statement published by the presidential press service. We must always proceed from the fact that we are a sovereign state and independent. Ukraine will be closely monitoring the talks. Last week, several Ukrainian military commanders warned Russia may try another attempt at invading the country from the north. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday said that Ukraine was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally. “Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus, is our constant priority,” Zelenskiy said after a meeting on Sunday with Ukraine’s top military command. We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios. Read the full story here: Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has said Ukraine will “neither surrender nor fulfil” Russia’s ultimatums. The end to the conflict “can only be accelerated by increasing artillery/tanks supply”, he wrote in a post on Twitter directed at western leaders. An air raid alert has been issued across Kyiv and most of Ukraine, according to officials. A statement by the Kyiv regional military administration reads: Air alarm in the Kyiv region. Stay tuned for further posts. Deutsche Welle’s Emmanuelle Chaze shares a map of where air sirens have sounded in Ukraine: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked western leaders meeting in Latvia to ramp up the supply of a wide range of weapons systems to his country. Addressing a meeting in Riga of leaders of countries in the Joint Expeditionary Force, which includes Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, Zelenskiy said: Russian aggression can and must fail. The task now is to make sure it happens faster. I call upon you to do everything to accelerate the defeat of the occupiers. Millions had been left without heat and water after Russia launched further attacks using Iranian drones last night, he said. He continued: May I ask you to increase the possibility of supplying air defence systems to our country ... 100% air shield for Ukraine, that would be one of the most successful steps against Russian aggression and this step is required right now. The time in Kyiv is nearly 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s stories so far: A Russian drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba has said. Russia unleashed 35 “kamikaze” drones on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday as many people slept, hitting critical infrastructure in and around Kyiv in Moscow’s third air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days. Ukraine’s air force says it shot down 30 out of 35 Russian-launched Shahed drones overnight. The Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 kamikaze drones were reportedly launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov, the force added. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had shot down four US-made HARM anti-radiation missiles over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, in the space of 24 hours, the state-run TASS news agency has reported. One person died and several were injured by Ukrainian shelling in the region on Sunday morning, the region’s governor told Reuters. Belarus’ defence ministry said on Monday it had completed a series of inspections of its armed forces’ military preparedness, hours ahead of a visit to Minsk by Belarus’ most important ally, the Russian president Vladimir Putin. Weeks of military manoeuvres and inspections have raised fears in Kyiv that Belarus, which acted as a staging post for Russia to launch its invasion of Ukraine in February, could be preparing to take a more active role in the conflict once again, Reuters reported. Russian troops that were moved to Belarus in October to become part of a regional formation will conduct battalion tactical exercises, the Russian Interfax news agency reported on Monday, citing the Russian defence ministry. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is due to fly to Belarus on Monday amid fears he intends to pressure the former Soviet ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine and open a new front. His visit for talks with the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, will be his first to Minsk since 2019. Russian military proxy group Wagner continues to take a major role in attritional combat around Bakhmut in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. In recent months, the group has developed offensive tactics to make use of the large number of poorly trained convicts it has recruited, the ministry notes in its latest intelligence report. Rishi Sunak has touched down in the Latvian capital, where he is meeting northern European allies to discuss countering Russian aggression. He will urge fellow leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force to stand firm in their support for Ukraine, after announcing a major new artillery package for the war-torn nation. EU countries will need to reach a compromise on a gas price cap on Monday, and the latest proposal on the table offers a good basis to do so, Malta’s energy minister, Miriam Dalli, has said. “What the presidency is proposing is a very good step in the right direction,” Dalli said before entering a meeting of the EU’s energy ministers. Four people in the southern Russian border region of Belgorod were reportedly wounded by shelling on Sunday, the governor said. Witnesses reported loud blasts in the regional capital. Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national address. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.” That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now.

Rishi Sunak has touched down in the Latvian capital, where he is meeting northern European allies to discuss countering Russian aggression. The UK prime minister landed in snowy Riga at 11.20am local time, stepping out of the plane into a gusty -4C, PA Media reported. He will urge fellow leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force to stand firm in their support for Ukraine, after announcing a major new artillery package for the war-torn nation. He will continue his whistlestop tour by flying to Estonia later on Monday, where he will meet British troops and sign a new technology partnership. Russia’s drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba has said. Russia unleashed 35 “kamikaze” drones on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday as many people slept, hitting critical infrastructure in and around Kyiv in Moscow’s third air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days. EU countries will need to reach a compromise on a gas price cap on Monday, and the latest proposal on the table offers a good basis to do so, Malta’s energy minister, Miriam Dalli, has said. “What the presidency is proposing is a very good step in the right direction,” Dalli said before entering a meeting of the EU’s energy ministers. “It shows also the willingness to arrive at a compromise today. I’m convinced that today we will mange to compromise, I believe that the willingness is there. Today is crunch time.” Critical power infrastructure burns after a drone attack in Kyiv this morning Ukraine’s air force says it shot down 30 out of 35 Russian-launched Shahed drones overnight. The Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 kamikaze drones were reportedly launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov, the force added. Russian troops that were moved to Belarus in October to become part of a regional formation will conduct battalion tactical exercises, the Russian Interfax news agency reported on Monday, citing the Russian defence ministry. Interfax cited the ministry’s statement as saying: The final assessment of the combat capability and combat readiness of the units will be given by the command at the final stage of coordination – after the battalion tactical exercises have been conducted.” It was not immediately clear when and where in Belarus the exercises will be conducted. Belarus defence ministry said in October that 9,000 Russian troops were moving to the country as part of a “regional grouping” of forces to protect its borders. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is set to fly to Belarus on Monday amid fears he intends to pressure the former Soviet ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine and open a new front. His visit for talks with the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, will be his first to Minsk since 2019. Ukrainian joint forces commander Serhiy Nayev said: During (these talks) questions will be worked out for further aggression against Ukraine and the broader involvement of the Belarusian armed forces in the operation against Ukraine, in particular, in our opinion, also on the ground.” Ukraine’s top general, Valery Zaluzhniy, told the Economist last week that Russia was preparing 200,000 fresh troops for a major offensive that could come from the east, south or even from Belarus as early as January, but more likely in spring. There has been constant Russian and Belarusian military activity for months in Belarus. Russia also used its ally as a launch pad for an abortive attack on Kyiv in February. Moscow and Minsk have since set up a joint regional unit of forces in Belarus and held numerous military exercises. Three Russian warplanes and an airborne early warning and control aircraft were deployed to Belarus last week. Foreign diplomats say Lukashenko, a pariah in the west who relies heavily on Russian support, understands it would be a deeply unpopular step at home for him to commit troops to Ukraine. But he has already supported Russia’s war extensively. Some military analysts see the manoeuvring as a ploy to make Ukraine commit forces to its north so it is more exposed to Russian assaults elsewhere. The UK is set to announce a major new artillery package for Ukraine as British prime minister Rishi Sunak prepares to meet with his Nordic, Baltic and Dutch counterparts in Riga, Latvia, on Monday. According to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office and as cited by Agence France-Presse, he will announce Britain’s intention to supply “hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition next year under a £250m ($304m) contract that will ensure a constant flow of critical artillery ammunition to Ukraine throughout 2023”. The prime minister will travel to Latvia for the leaders’ gathering of Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) countries, including Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania and the Netherlands, which will be addressed by Ukraine’s president, Volodomyr Zelenksiy. From the Arctic Circle to the Isle of Wight, the UK and our European allies have been in lockstep in our response to the invasion of Ukraine, and we remain steadfast in our ambition for peace in Europe once again,” Sunak said ahead of the visit. But to achieve peace, we must deter aggression and our deployments across the region together are vital in ensuring we are able to respond to the gravest of threats. I know this Joint Expeditionary Force summit will only underline our close friendships and unwavering support for Ukraine.” No 10 said the meeting would also discuss intelligence sharing between JEF countries, threats to infrastructure and hybrid threats posed by Russian aggression and bolstering support to Finland and Sweden ahead of their accession to Nato. Further announcements on joint military exercises are also expected. Sunak is then expected to fly on to Estonia, where he will meet UK and Nato troops serving on the military alliance’s eastern flank on the Russian border. New information published by Ukrainian authorities suggests that Russia’s earlier drone attack on Kyiv damaged critical infrastructure and injured two people. Kyiv’s regional governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, wrote on Telegram this morning: Infrastructure objects and private houses were damaged as a result of a night drone attack in the Kyiv region … two victims. People are given help – they are under the supervision of doctors.” Russian military proxy group Wagner continues to take a major role in attritional combat around Bakhmut in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. In recent months, the group has developed offensive tactics to make use of the large number of poorly trained convicts it has recruited, the ministry notes in its latest intelligence report. Individual fighters are likely issued a smart phone or tablet which shows the individual’s designated axis of advance and assault objective superimposed on commercial satellite imagery. At platoon level and above, commanders likely remain in cover and give orders over radios, informed by video feeds from small un-crewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). Individuals and sections are ordered to proceed on the preplanned route, often with fire-support, but less often alongside armoured vehicles. Wagner operatives who deviate from their assault routes without authorisation are likely being threatened with summary execution. These brutal tactics aim to conserve Wagner’s rare assets of experienced commanders and armoured vehicles, at the expense of the more readily available convict-recruits, which the organisation assesses as expendable.” At least two powerful explosions rocked Ukraine’s capital in the early hours of Monday morning, as officials claim the city was hit by a series of Russian drones. Multiple local news sources reported the blasts in central Kyiv. Several loud blasts were also heard in the city’s surrounding regions, Reuters witnesses reported. A fire was also reported in Kyiv’s central Shevchenkivskyi district. Ukraine’s armed forces first sounded the alarm in a Telegram alert about 2am local time, saying the military had sent air defences to protect the capital from drone attacks. The Kyiv city state administration also sent an alert urging residents to seek shelter. It later added that more than 20 Iranian-made drones were detected over Kyiv’s air space and at least 15 of them were shot down. Oleksiy Kuleba, head of the Kyiv regional military administration, said air defence works were operating in the region and claimed the city was under a drone attack. The drone attack continues,” he said. Kyiv’s military administration later said that nine Iranian-made Shahed drones were shot down in Kyiv’s airspace. In a Telegram update, the administration said: Air alert continues in Kyiv. The enemy is attacking the capital with ‘Shahed’ barrage ammunition. Air defence is being at work.” It was not immediately clear whether the blasts were air defence systems destroying the drones or hitting targets. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. A series of explosions have rocked Ukraine’s capital Kyiv in the early hours of this morning, according to regional officials. Meanwhile, the UK is set to announce a major new artillery package for Ukraine as British prime minister Rishi Sunak prepares to meet with his Nordic, Baltic and Dutch counterparts in Riga, Latvia, on Monday. For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: The UK is set to announce a major new artillery package for Ukraine as British prime minister Rishi Sunak prepares to meet with his Nordic, Baltic and Dutch counterparts in Riga, Latvia, on Monday. According to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office and as cited by Agence France-Presse, he will announce Britain’s intention to supply “hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition next year under a £250m ($304m) contract that will ensure a constant flow of critical artillery ammunition to Ukraine throughout 2023”. Ukraine said Russian shelling targeted the southern city of Kherson on Sunday, which has faced repeated attacks since Kyiv’s forces recaptured it last month. “Another blow was delivered to the city centre. Three people were injured. They received shrapnel wounds, one wounded is in a serious condition,” deputy head of the president’s office Kyrylo Tymoshenko said. Regional governor Yaroslav Yanushevich said on Sunday that Moscow’s troops had carried out 54 attacks on Kherson region with artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, tanks and mortars over the previous day, leaving three dead and wounding six others. Four people in the southern Russian border region of Belgorod were reportedly wounded by shelling on Sunday, the governor said. Witnesses reported loud blasts in the regional capital. Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national address. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.” Power has been restored to three million more Ukrainians after the latest Russian attacks on infrastructure, bringing the total to nine million after two days, Ukraine’s president has said. “Electricity supplies have been restored to a further three million Ukrainians,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his Sunday evening video address. “That means after the terrorist strikes on Friday, we have results already for nine million of our people.” Heating has also been fully restored to Kyiv, the city’s mayor said. Protecting Ukraine’s borders is a “constant priority” as the country readies for all possible scenarios with Russia and its ally Belarus, Zelenskiy added. “Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus – is our constant priority,” he said in his nightly video address. “We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios.” Zelenskiy also issued a new appeal to western nations to provide Ukraine with effective air defences. Russia will reportedly deploy musicians to Ukraine’s frontlines in a bid to boost morale, according to its defence ministry. The “frontline creative brigade” will be tasked with maintaining “a high moral, political and psychological state [among] the participants of the special military operation,” Russian outlet RBC news cited the ministry as saying. UK defence officials said the new unit is in keeping with the historic use of “military music and organised entertainment” to boost morale as low morale continues to be a “significant vulnerability across much of the Russian force”. Iran’s foreign ministry has said it will not “seek permission from anyone” to expand relations with Russia, dismissing US concerns over a growing military partnership between Tehran and Moscow. Iran has been accused of supplying drones to Russia, allegedly used to attack Ukraine. CIA chief William Burns said the military cooperation between Iran and Russia “poses real threats” to US allies in the Middle East. Nasser Kanani, spokesperson for Iran’s foreign ministry, called the comments “baseless” adding that Tehran “acts independently in regulating its foreign relations and does not seek permission from anyone”. Veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger believes the time is approaching for a negotiated peace in Ukraine. “The time is approaching to build on the strategic changes which have already been accomplished and to integrate them into a new structure towards achieving peace through negotiation,” Kissinger wrote in The Spectator magazine. “A peace process should link Ukraine to Nato, h owever expressed. The alternative of neutrality is no longer meaningful,” he added. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak dismissed the comments as amounting to “appeasing the aggressor” and said there could be no deal involving ceding territory. “Any agreement with the devil – a bad peace at the expense of Ukrainian territories – will be a victory for Putin and a recipe for success for autocrats around the world,” he said in a statement on Telegram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/13/heatwaves-could-add-to-energy-problems-across-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-13T08:30:10Z","webTitle":"Weather tracker: heatwaves could add to energy problems across Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/13/heatwaves-could-add-to-energy-problems-across-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/13/heatwaves-could-add-to-energy-problems-across-europe","fields":{"headline":"Weather tracker: heatwaves could add to energy problems across Europe","bodyText":"The extreme heat affecting Iberia this week has led to temperatures peaking at over 40C in some parts of Spain over the past days – that’s 7-9C above the seasonal average in some locations like Andalucia. The hot and dry weather has worsened the drought issues across the region, with many water reservoirs recording extremely low levels of storage at the start of the summer season, following a very dry winter (especially January/February) and a very dry May too. Spain generates more than 10% of its electricity from hydropower plants, so this will have some serious implications for energy production and availability/prices. The dry and hot conditions are moving eastwards through the rest of this week and into the weekend, across north-western and central Europe, before reaching further north and east into eastern Europe through the weekend and into the following week. Temperatures are expected to reach into the 30s across many areas, peaking at between 7-10C above the seasonal normal in some locations. The heatwave will lead to a surge in energy demand for cooling across some parts of Europe, and will also increase the river water temperatures used for cooling nuclear power plants across the continent. In the past, France’s EDF had to halt some of their nuclear reactors due to the heat and the rising Rhone River temperatures, although this is more common in July and August rather than mid-June. On the other side of the Atlantic, since the beginning of June, large swathes of central and eastern US have experienced mostly seasonal conditions, with western parts of the American continent facing the hottest and driest conditions so far. However, a change is coming through this week as heat is building across the central plains and expanding eastwards, with this likely to lead to some unseasonably hot weather through the first half of this week with many temperature records being challenged. Later this week and into the weekend, a cold front will push west to east, bringing some relief to some parts of the states."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/14/ukraine-war-everything-we-know-on-day-19-of-the-russian-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-14T18:32:35Z","webTitle":"Ukraine war: everything we know on day 19 of the Russian invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/ukraine-war-everything-we-know-on-day-19-of-the-russian-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/14/ukraine-war-everything-we-know-on-day-19-of-the-russian-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine war: everything we know on day 19 of the Russian invasion","bodyText":"A Russian airstrike hit a residential building in Kyiv as Moscow’s forces stepped up their brutal campaign to capture Ukraine’s capital and other major cities. One person was found dead in the nine-storey apartment building, officials said, with three more people hospitalised as air raid sirens sounded in the capital and other cities hours before Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were set to resume talks. The Antonov aircraft plant in Kyiv was shelled by Russian forces, the Kyiv city administration said in an update on its official Telegram account. At least two people were killed and seven injured, it said. Ukrainian authorities have denied accusations by the Russians after a Ukrainian missile allegedly exploded in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk killing at least 20 civilians. Ukrainian military spokesman Leonid Matyukhin said the missile, that carried a shrapnel warhead, was in fact a Russian rocket. The Russian and Ukrainian claims cannot be independently verified. There are reports that Russian forces blew up explosives at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s parliament earlier said Russian troops planned to begin “disposal” of ammunition in front of the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear power station. At least nine people were reportedly killed and nine more wounded in an airstrike on a television tower in Ukraine’s northern Rivne region. “There are still people under the rubble,” governor Vitaliy Koval said in an online post, Reuters reports. Ninety children have been killed and more than 100 wounded in Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February, the Ukrainian general prosecutor’s office said. “The highest number of victims are in the Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kherson, Mykolayiv and Zhytomyr regions,” it said in a statement. A convoy of more than 160 cars departed from Mariupol today, local officials said, in what appeared to be the first successful attempt to evacuate civilians from the encircled Ukrainian city. After several days of failed attempts to deliver supplies to Mariupol and provide safe passage out for trapped civilians, the city council said a local ceasefire was holding and the convoy had left for the city of Zaporizhzhia. A close ally of Vladimir Putin has admitted Russia’s military operation in Ukraine has not gone as quickly as the Kremlin had wanted, Reuters reports. National Guard chief Viktor Zolotov blamed the slower-than-expected progress on what he said were far-right Ukrainian forces hiding behind civilians, an accusation repeatedly made by Russian officials. Russia has denied reports that it has asked China for military equipment, claiming it has sufficient military clout to fulfil all of its aims in Ukraine without any need for help from China. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russian troops could take “major population centres under full control” in Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/30/the-guardian-view-on-kherson-the-cost-of-war-in-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-30T18:09:57Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Kherson: the cost of war in Ukraine | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/30/the-guardian-view-on-kherson-the-cost-of-war-in-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/30/the-guardian-view-on-kherson-the-cost-of-war-in-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Kherson: the cost of war in Ukraine","bodyText":"Russia took the city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, little more than a week after launching its invasion on 24 February. It was the first major city to fall to Vladimir Putin’s forces, and remains the only regional capital to have done so. With the failure of the Russian plan for a lightning victory increasingly evident, and humiliating, the city’s capture was important for Moscow for symbolic as well as strategic reasons. Many of its 280,000 inhabitants remained not only angry but defiant, mounting protests in its centre. But the gruelling impact of Russian occupation has taken its toll. The protests were suppressed by troops. The crackdown on dissent has been ruthless and thorough. A Russian curriculum has been imposed in schools. So Monday’s declaration by a Ukrainian military official that a long-anticipated southern counterattack had begun was a striking moment six months into this war. Ukraine’s southern command declared that Russia had suffered heavy losses of personnel and equipment (while Russia’s defence ministry claimed that it had inflicted severe losses on the Ukrainians). Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, claimed that troops had broken through Russian defences in several areas near Kherson – yet was also keen to manage expectations, portraying a “slow operation to grind the enemy”. The extent of the pushback is far from clear. One Ukrainian official described “normal operations”, and some fighters have suggested that the attacks fall short of a full counteroffensive. Partisan attacks were already occurring. Despite the flow of arms from the US especially, Ukraine remains very short of weapons and personnel to attempt a major assault. Some wondered if trailing a counteroffensive so heavily in advance was designed to try to distract Russia from the east, where it has been advancing, albeit slowly. The US military said on Monday that there was an uptick in fighting around Kherson, but could not confirm whether an offensive had begun. The former head of MI6 Sir Alex Younger spoke not in military terms but of a “key psychological moment” when interviewed by the BBC, and talked not about place but time. Russian occupation is having an incremental effect not only on the wellbeing of civilians, but also on the city’s status. The Kremlin plans a referendum to create the pretext for bringing the region into Russia, despite minimal enthusiasm; Ukraine may hope to postpone the vote. In logistical terms, bitter winter conditions are also likely to entrench the military stalemate. But Sir Alex was pointing to Kyiv’s need to show that it can do more than resist the Russian advance; it can seize the initiative – thus shoring up the morale of its own population, as it faces a grim winter, and maintaining the support of western leaders, whose own voters are struggling with soaring energy costs. As he discussed the development, EU defence ministers meeting in Prague were expected to approve plans for a training facility for Ukrainian troops, but finance ministers remained divided over hitting Russia further. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis is growing. Unable to make swift military progress, Russia may have shifted focus towards formalising annexation and to economic punishment. Kyiv fears Russia could target its energy grid and turn off the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Some think that as many as 2 million Ukrainians could cross into Poland this winter. As hazy as the military situation remains, its brutal impact on civilians could not be clearer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/06/drax-agrees-to-extend-life-of-coal-fired-power-units-over-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-06T18:15:29Z","webTitle":"Drax agrees to extend life of coal-fired power units over winter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/06/drax-agrees-to-extend-life-of-coal-fired-power-units-over-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/06/drax-agrees-to-extend-life-of-coal-fired-power-units-over-winter","fields":{"headline":"Drax agrees to extend life of coal-fired power units over winter","bodyText":"Drax has agreed to extend the life of its coal-fired electricity generation units through this winter as the government scrambles to shore up Britain’s energy supplies. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said the operator of the Yorkshire power station had agreed to push its planned closure back by six months until March. The plant had been due to close its coal operations in late September as Drax attempts to reduce the carbon in its operations. The company has switched most of its operations towards biomass but it has two remaining coal units. Kwarteng has embarked on a push to secure electricity supplies for the winter after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine upended already squeezed energy markets. Drax said the units “will not generate commercially for the duration of the agreement and only operate if and when instructed to do so by National Grid”. Under the terms of the agreement, Drax will be paid a fee and compensated for costs. The company said its profits were now likely to be “slightly above the top of the range of analyst expectations”. Analysts had pencilled in profits of £584m to £635m. Kwarteng said on Wednesday: “With Russia cutting off gas to parts of Europe, this is a sensible precaution back home. As energy secretary I have a responsibility to ensure we have enough supply this winter.” The agreement, negotiated between National Grid and Drax, follows a similar move at EDF’s West Burton A plant at in Nottinghamshire. That plant will also stay in operation for a further six months. Talks over the future of a third coal-fired power station run by Uniper, which is facing financial strife in Germany, are expected to conclude in the next few weeks, sources close to the situation said. Kwarteng said: “We now have two coal plants available this winter. Negotiations ongoing with one more.” The government is also in discussions with the British Gas owner, Centrica, to reopen its Rough gas storage site in the North Sea, which was closed in 2017. The energy security bill, which aims to boost the production of domestic energy supplies, reached parliament on Wednesday. In the longer term, ministers hope to boost Britain’s capacity to produce energy from a string of sources including new nuclear power stations and windfarms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/10/north-korea-says-missile-tests-simulated-striking-south-with-tactical-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-10T02:38:46Z","webTitle":"North Korea says missile tests simulated striking South with tactical nuclear weapons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/10/north-korea-says-missile-tests-simulated-striking-south-with-tactical-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/10/north-korea-says-missile-tests-simulated-striking-south-with-tactical-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"headline":"North Korea says missile tests simulated striking South with tactical nuclear weapons","bodyText":"North Korea’s recent flurry of missile tests demonstrated its ability to carry out strikes with tactical nuclear weapons, its leader, Kim Jong-un, has said, adding that his forces were “completely ready to hit and destroy targets at any time from any location”. Kim, who last month said the North’s transformation into a nuclear power was “irreversible,” said the drills were “an obvious warning and clear demonstration” to the country’s enemies. The regime’s short-range tactical nuclear missiles would be unable to reach its nemesis – the US – but could theoretically be used against the South and Japan. In a report carried on Monday, the state news agency KCNA said that Kim had ordered the test launches in response to large-scale navy drills by South Korean and US forces. Tokyo and Washington recently resumed the exercises, including the deployment of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan to waters off the east coast of South Korea – a move that infuriated Pyongyang, where the drills are seen as a rehearsal for an invasion. In response, North Korea “decided to organise military drills under the simulation of an actual war,” KCNA reported. Army units involved in “the operation of tactical nukes, staged military drills from 25 September to 9 October in order to check and assess the war deterrent and nuclear counterattack capability of the country,” the report said, confirming that Kim had personally directed the exercises. Official photographs showed Kim at all of the missile launches and exercises, giving orders and posing with smiling soldiers. “They’re pursuing a tactical nuclear weapon for sure,” said US-based security analyst Ankit Panda. “I suspect they’ll gradually nuclearise many of their new short-range missiles, including the manoeuvring missiles.” The fact that North Korea has described all seven of its recent missile launches as being linked to “tactical nuclear operations units” is significant, he added, since the inventory includes everything from short-range and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, to a new short-range missile designed to be launched from a submarine. Kim, who has presided over dramatic improvements in missile and nuclear development despite years of UN sanctions, has long wanted to acquire tactical nuclear weapons – smaller, lighter weapons designed for battlefield use – and made it a top priority at a key party congress in January 2021. Last month, North Korea revised its nuclear laws to enable it to conduct preemptive nuclear strikes, including in response to conventional attacks. Kim guided exercises by the country’s nuclear tactical operation units over the past two weeks, involving ballistic missiles with mock nuclear warheads, KCNA said, adding that they were meant to deliver a strong deterrent message. “The effectiveness and practical combat capability of our nuclear combat force were fully demonstrated as it stands completely ready to hit and destroy targets at any time from any location,” KCNA quoted Kim as saying. “Even though the enemy continues to talk about dialogue and negotiations, we do not have anything to talk about nor do we feel the need to do so.” The various tests simulated targeting military command facilities, striking main ports, and neutralising airports in the South. Tactical nuclear weapons South Korean and US officials say there are signs North Korea could soon detonate a new nuclear device in underground tunnels at its Punggye-ri nuclear test site, which was officially closed in 2018. Analysts say putting small warheads on short-range missiles could represent a dangerous change in the way North Korea deploys and plans to use nuclear weapons. On 4 October, the North test-fired a ballistic missile farther than ever before, flying what it said was a new intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan for the first time since 2017. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said North Korea had “multiple motivations” for publicising the launches. “Kim Jong-un’s public appearance after a month-long absence provides a patriotic headline to mark (Monday’s) founding anniversary of the ruling Workers’ party,” Easley said. “Pyongyang has been concerned about military exercises by the US, South Korea and Japan, so to strengthen its self-proclaimed deterrent, it is making explicit the nuclear threat behind its recent missile launches,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2022/may/20/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-20T20:00:12Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/20/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/may/20/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A report referred to an employment tribunal ruling about “sexual harassment”.

Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, the second biggest in Europe, housing six of the country’s 15 reactors. In their letter to the IAEA, Russian officials insisted that Ukrainian staff at the plant were continuing to “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation”. However, the Ukrainian state enterprise running the country’s nuclear industry, Energoatom, accused the Russian military of “openly terrorizing employees of the station and residents of its satellite city Energodar”. Video footage shared on social media by a Ukrainian official showed crowds of Ukrainians forming a barrier between the Russian forces and the nuclear plant, blocking their advance. The interior ministry official, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a Facebook post: “Russian generals – change your minds! Do not create conditions for the new Chernobyl! Radiation knows no nationalities, one does not spare anyone! Go around the Energodar and Zaporizhzhya.” Ukraine has asked the IAEA to declare a 30km safe zone around Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants. Grossi told the IAEA board of governors meeting in Vienna: “It is of critical importance that the armed conflict and activities on the ground around Zaporizhihia nuclear power plant and any other of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities in no way interrupts or endangers the facilities or the people working at and around them.” The IAEA also said that a feed of radiation data from Zaporizhzhia had been interrupted on Tuesday and that Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate (SNRIU) was trying to find out the reason for the break and to restore the flow of data. Grossi also raised concern over a report from the SNRIU that since Russians took over the Chernobyl plant, site of the 1986 disaster in north western Ukraine near the Belarus border, the staff there had not been permitted to go home. The US deputy envoy to the IAEA, Louis Bono, said: “The Ukrainian staff at the site have not been allowed to leave and have been forced to work multiple shifts. This added stress on staff performing critical tasks further jeopardizes the safety and security of the site and the public.” In his remarks Grossi said: “It is of utmost importance that the staff working at [the Chernobyl plant] are able to do their job safely and effectively, and that their personal wellbeing is guaranteed by those who have taken control,” The remains of the reactor core which exploded in 1986 is buried under concrete at the site, and there are also spent fuel storage facilities and a large amount of radioactive dust in the topsoil of the surrounding area. The churning up of the soil by Russian military vehicles caused limited radiation spikes. In a statement, Energoatom said: “Being in the exclusion zone now and apparently not having the skills to ensure personal safety when working in radioactively contaminated areas, the invaders are exposed to significant external and internal radiation, which will undoubtedly manifest itself in the form of cancer.” On Sunday, the Ukrainian authorities said Russian missiles had struck the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in Kyiv. The day before, an electrical transformer in another waste facility in Kharkiv was damaged. In both cases there was no radioactive release, but the incidents highlighted the potential threat of ecological disaster from a war underway in a country with an extensive nuclear industry. The American Nuclear Society (ANS), an association of industry professionals, is seeking to send material support to Ukraine to help nuclear workers there. “The staff at Ukraine’s nuclear power plants must be able to fulfill their duties without interruption undue pressure or the fear of being killed or injured,” the ANS said in a statement. “Ukraine’s nuclear workers need their rest between shifts, access to their homes and a peace of mind that their loved ones are safe. The society’s president, Steven Nesbit, said he hoped that the Russian invaders were aware of the dangers of a nuclear accident. “All I can say is it’s hard to believe that they wouldn’t have a sensitivity to the issues here,” Nesbit said. “Russia and Vladimir Putin need to be taking all steps they can to avoid becoming even more of a pariah nation than they have become.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/05/putin-erdogan-meet-secretive-talks-sochi-russia-turkey-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T15:09:41Z","webTitle":"Putin and Erdoğan meet for secretive talks in Sochi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/putin-erdogan-meet-secretive-talks-sochi-russia-turkey-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/05/putin-erdogan-meet-secretive-talks-sochi-russia-turkey-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Putin and Erdoğan meet for secretive talks in Sochi","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has met Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for talks expected to focus on Russia’s war in Ukraine and that are being rumoured to include Kremlin efforts to circumvent western sanctions. Putin welcomed the Turkish president to Sochi, a resort city on the Black Sea, by thanking him for his help in securing an international deal that resumed exports of grain from Ukraine that had been disrupted by the Kremlin war machine – as well as Russian foodstuffs and fertilisers – to world markets. The deal ended a standoff that had threatened a global food crisis, as Ukraine and Russia are some of the world’s largest exporters of grain. Another three ships carrying almost 60,000 tonnes of grain between them departed Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Friday and are on their way to Britain, Ireland and Turkey respectively. “This is a very pressing problem for many countries, first and foremost, the developing ones that are on the brink of big problems with food and fertiliser supply. The decisions made with your direct participation are very important for all these countries,” Putin told Erdoğan as their closed-door meetings began. But reports have warned that the meeting may serve an ulterior motive. A Ukrainian government report described by the Washington Post said Putin would seek Russian stakes in Turkish oil refineries, terminals and reservoirs in order to help disguise the origin of Russian oil exports ahead of a planned EU oil embargo. The newspaper also reported that Russia could seek correspondent accounts for large Russian banks to circumvent financial sanctions. The Russian government did not confirm the report and there was no indication that Turkey would entertain the proposals, which would put the Nato member at considerable risk of secondary sanctions. At least publicly, economic cooperation led the agenda at the talks. Putin noted that the TurkStream pipeline had continued operating “smoothly … in contrast to every other route supplying our hydrocarbons”. Erdoğan brought up plans for a nuclear power plant to be built with Russian help. But the tensions between the two countries and their leaders remain considerable. Turkey is a member of Nato, has sold advanced weaponry such as Bayraktar drones to Ukraine, and is at odds with Russia over the future of Syria, where the Kremlin has backed Bashar al-Assad while Turkey has sought to gain influence in the country’s north. There were other indications that the two leaders planned to discuss more than just their economic agenda. Before the meeting began, Russian journalists noted that Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader who has sent forces under his command to both Syria and Ukraine, was in attendance. The two men are expected to speak behind closed doors over a late lunch. They are not expected to give a joint statement following the summit. The Russian deputy prime minister Alexander Novak is expected to address the press after the summit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-334-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-23T15:09:28Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 334 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-334-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-334-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 334 of the invasion","bodyText":"Germany’s approval for the re-export of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine is of secondary importance as Poland could send those tanks as part of a coalition of countries even without its permission, the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said on Monday. “We will ask for such permission, but this is an issue of secondary importance. Even if we did not get this approval … we would still transfer our tanks together with others to Ukraine”, Morawiecki told reporters. German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock’s comment on Sunday, that her country would not “stand in the way” of Poland sending Leopard tanks to Ukraine, is causing some confusion in Berlin. It remains unclear whether her remarks are indicative of a shift in the government’s position. Baerbock did not repeat her comment when pressed on the matter on Monday morning. “It’s important that we as an international community do everything to defend Ukraine, so that Ukraine wins”, she told press at a meeting of the EU’s foreign affairs council in Brussels. “Because if it loses Ukraine will cease to exist”. German chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday promised that Germany will “continue to support Ukraine – for as long and as comprehensively as necessary”, adding: “Together, as Europeans – in defence of our European peace project.” Germany’s new defence minister, Boris Pistorius, plans to visit Ukraine soon, he told a German newspaper. German government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said “To this hour we have not received a request.” Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said during his visit to South Africa on Monday that Ukraine was rejecting peace talks and the longer this continued, the harder it would be to resolve the conflict. Lavrov met South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, in a trip some opposition parties and the small Ukrainian community in South Africa have condemned as insensitive. The South African military is set to host a joint military exercise with Russia and China on its east coast on 17-27 February. 18 people injured as a result of last weekend’s rocket attack on a high-rise building in Dnipro remain in hospital, including one child. Ukraine state broadcaster reports “There are no serious patients among these patients, all of them were transferred from intensive care units to general departments.” Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of Sumy in Ukraine’s north-east, has said that an apartment building and railway infrastructure has been hit by Russian fire in Vorozhba. There were no details of casualties. The top Moscow-installed official in the Russian-occupied parts of the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine said late on Sunday that he had visited the town of Soledar, which Russia claimed to have captured earlier this month. Denis Pushilin published a short video on the Telegram messaging app that showed him driving and walking amid desolate areas and destroyed buildings. The Guardian was not able to independently verify when and where the video was taken. On 11 January, the private Russian military group Wagner said it had captured Soledar. Ukraine has never publicly said that the town was taken by Russian forces. Russia claimed to have made advances in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region. After months of stalemate in the south-eastern region, Moscow-installed officials say the front is now “mobile” while the Ukrainian army reported that 15 settlements had come under artillery fire. “During offensive operations in the direction of Zaporizhzhia, units of the eastern military district took up more advantageous ground and positions,” the defence ministry said on Sunday. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that Russian forces claim to have destroyed a large Ukrainian ammunition depot in the Kherson region. Russian secret service the SVR has claimed – without presenting evidence –that Ukraine is storing weapons and ammunition supplied by the west on the territory of nuclear power plants. European Council president Charles Michel has urged the bloc’s national leaders to push forward with talks on using $300bn-worth of confiscated Russian central bank assets for the reconstruction of Ukraine, the Financial Times reports. Michael said he wanted to explore the idea of managing the Russian central bank’s frozen assets to generate profits, which could then be earmarked for reconstruction efforts. Russia has said it is downgrading diplomatic relations with the Nato member Estonia, accusing Tallinn of “total Russophobia”. The Russian foreign ministry said it had told the Estonian envoy he must leave next month, and both countries would be represented in each other’s capitals by an interim charge d’affaires instead of an ambassador. Latvia will downgrade its diplomatic ties with Russia and inform its Russian ambassador to leave the country by 24 February. Russia said on Monday that no new date had been set for talks with the US on the New Start nuclear arms treaty, accusing the US of ramping up tensions between the two sides. A former commander with the Russian mercenary Wagner Group who sought asylum in Norway has been told he will be deported, according to a Russian rights group. Andrey Medvedev, 26, crossed the border into Norway near the Pasvikdalen valley earlier this month, where he was arrested and detained by border guards. Medvedev’s lawyer has dismissed the claim, saying “the risk of him being deported? It is zero.” Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson made a surprise visit to Ukraine, where he said that it was “the moment to double down and to give the Ukrainians all the tools they need to finish the job”. Downing Street said Rishi Sunak is “supportive” of Boris Johnson’s visit, despite warnings that it would undermine the current prime minister’s authority. Johnson’s visits to Ukraine have often coincided with moments of domestic crisis, and he is currently under pressure over his financial relationship with BBC chairman Richard Sharp. French president Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday he does not rule out the possibility of sending Leclerc tanks to Ukraine. “As for the Leclercs, I have asked the defence ministry to work on it. Nothing is excluded,” he said while speaking at a summit with German chancellor Scholz. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed Ukraine will not tolerate corruption and promised forthcoming key decisions on uprooting it this week. “I want this to be clear: there will be no return to what used to be in the past, to the way various people close to state institutions or those who spent their entire lives chasing a chair used to live,” he said in his nightly video address. The EU has made anti-corruption reforms one of its key requirements for Ukraine’s membership to the bloc, after granting Kyiv candidate status last year. Norway’s army chief has estimated 180,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in over the course of the conflict, while the figure for the Ukrainians is 100,000 military casualties and 30,000 dead civilians. Norwegian chief of defence Eirik Kristoffersen gave the figures in an interview with TV2, without specifying how the numbers were calculated. The figures cannot be independently verified."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/oct/27/dining-across-the-divide-he-supports-the-royal-family-but-im-a-republican-id-get-rid-of-all-of-them","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T11:30:28Z","webTitle":"Dining across the divide: ‘He supports the royal family, but I’m a republican – I’d get rid of all of them’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/oct/27/dining-across-the-divide-he-supports-the-royal-family-but-im-a-republican-id-get-rid-of-all-of-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/oct/27/dining-across-the-divide-he-supports-the-royal-family-but-im-a-republican-id-get-rid-of-all-of-them","fields":{"headline":"Dining across the divide: ‘He supports the royal family, but I’m a republican – I’d get rid of all of them’","bodyText":"Julie, 53, Oxfordshire Occupation Inclusion manager in scientific research Voting record Labour and Lib Dem in the past.

We’re either going to have to carry on buying wood pellets, relying on Russian energy or cut the power off. The country’s going to have to make a choice.

We ask an expert","bodyText":"With the exception of Scotland, this Monday is the UK’s last bank holiday before Christmas. The UK gets eight days a year in comparison with the EU average of 12.8. But, beyond opportunities to relax, what do they mean for the planet? I spoke to Dénes Csala, who found that each bank holiday saves 100,000 tonnes of carbon. Your findings surprised me, especially when the bank holidays are such a popular time to fly abroad. Some are, though some are also family events, so people stay home. And when we looked at all the bank holidays, we found energy consumption dropped by about 10% overall, probably because the commute vanished. How did you get to 10%? We used statistics published by Entsoe-E – the EU’s energy watchdog. But what’s striking is, even though energy consumption drops by about 10%, we calculated that emissions could drop by up to 22%-25%. We use cleaner energy sources first, such as nuclear power. As we require more energy, we start to tap into other sources, like wind turbines. It’s only when we’re at peak energy usage that we start to use the sources with the highest emissions – such as natural gas. Plus there are big differences between summer and winter. In summer, we consume less. So from an emissions perspective, we’d be better off having more bank holidays in the winter? The numbers would suggest that. Winter is for hibernation! I know it, you know it, the bears know it. You mentioned the impact of commuting – does that mean hybrid working is good for the planet, too? I don’t think enough time has passed to make that judgment. From an energy consumption perspective, there may be a drop, but there are other considerations, such as how office buildings may be more efficient than houses. Are there energy-mindful things hybrid teams could be doing? Working in different slots to reduce peaks from commuting: so some people work from 8am to 4pm, others 9am to 5pm, and 10am to 6pm. How funny, I was just reading an article about circadian rhythms. Apparently we’re all on different body clocks and are most productive at different times of the day, so it’s quite mad that we’re forced to live on the same timetable. I think personalising the work week would have many gains. Take this idea of the four-day week: a three-day weekend sounds alluring but the best way might not actually be having Friday off for everyone, but an extra day off at different times. But it is a false dream to think a four-day work week will suddenly halve emissions. In Utah, a four-day week trial reduced energy use by 13%, but it was abandoned – the state government didn’t think it was worth it. As work dreams go, I like the utopia where machines do the drudgery so human work is only the fulfilling stuff – inventing and creating. Mind you, I’m not sure how energy-efficient those machines would be. That’s interesting – if we replaced human workers with robots, which would be more energy-efficient? You’d think the robots – but then you think about the energy that goes into manufacturing a product somewhere in Asia and putting it on a ship and, well, I’m not so sure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/17/jeremy-hunt-windfall-tax-on-energy-leaves-several-billion-of-the-table","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T19:33:25Z","webTitle":"Hunt’s windfall tax on energy leaves several billion of the table | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/17/jeremy-hunt-windfall-tax-on-energy-leaves-several-billion-of-the-table","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/17/jeremy-hunt-windfall-tax-on-energy-leaves-several-billion-of-the-table","fields":{"headline":"Hunt’s windfall tax on energy leaves several billion on the table","bodyText":"Always wait for the small print with windfall taxes. Shares in the quoted electricity generators – the likes of Centrica, Drax and SSE – fell for about half an hour as the chancellor announced in the House of Commons a stiff-sounding windfall tax. Then prices rebounded – plus a bit – as the details of the scheme emerged to reveal that Jeremy Hunt had been far less severe than he could have been. “A very reasonable outcome,” commented Bernstein’s analysts, looking through the lens of companies and investors. You bet: while promising to raise £14bn from generators out to 2028, Hunt left several billion on the table. The first critical detail was the definition of generators’ “extraordinary” profits – the part to which the new 45% levy will apply. It references revenues above £75 per megawatt-hour, whereas investors were braced for a figure closer to £60. By the close of trading, the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 index was British Gas owner Centrica, which made its best decision in years when it decided to retain, rather try to flog, its 20% stake in the UK’s existing fleet of nuclear power stations last year. Those ageing nuclear plants, with largely fixed costs, are a supremely lucrative asset to own while sky-high gas prices are dictating the wholesale price of electricity. Therein lies the unanswerable case for a levy on generators to go alongside the one on North Sea producers: nuclear, renewables and biomass firms (or those not on contracts-for-difference arrangements) are enjoying massively outsized returns versus their investment risk thanks to a “made-in-Russia energy crisis”, as Hunt put it. And the second important detail was that gas-fired power stations have been excluded from the levy. Consider that a victory for SSE and others with significant gas-fired portfolios. Their plea that riskier “flexible” generating capacity should be spared has prevailed, even though gas-fired stations are themselves enjoying a surge in profit margins that could equally be called extraordinary. Scottish Power, which sold its stations to concentrate on wind and solar in 2018 to Drax (which itself sold them on 2020), grumbled about “a recession made by gas, but a recovery to be paid for by renewables”. It’s a fair point. On the plus side, Hunt has at least provided clarity. After six months of indecision in government, that was the minimum requirement, as argued here yesterday. The generators now know the rules. But let’s be clear: the windfall formula is tame. What is going on with Bulb? There was one hell of a footnote in the Office for Budget Responsibility’s analysis: “The total cost of the Bulb Energy bailout has reached £6.5bn”. Since the upper end of outsiders’ estimates was previously £4bn, the new figure requires an explanation, which the OBR unfortunately did not provide fully. One must assume the government’s refusal to allow a nationalised Bulb to run a hedging programme on energy purchases is to blame. Bulb was left to buy for customers at spot prices in a rising market because the Treasury regards hedging instruments as too risky – or so Kwasi Kwarteng, when business secretary, said. If so, the Treasury’s stance was ridiculous. All energy suppliers hedge; it is how the industry works. The National Audit Office is having a look at the less than transparent terms of the pending sale of Bulb to Octopus Energy. It should extend its inquiry to the government’s entire oversight of Bulb over the past 12 months. Nationalisation was never going to be costless, but £6.5bn – if that is a cash cost to the public purse – is scandalous. You could buy Centrica (market cap £5.1bn) for less. High street reprieve On business rates in England, Hunt did well. He pulled on all the main levers to give high streets some help: he froze the multiplier; he allowed firms with lower bills from property revaluations to enjoy the full benefit immediately by scrapping transitional caps; and he extended and increased relief for retail, hospitality and leisure firms. The net effect will be a freeze, more or less, in government receipts from business rates next year. Within that overall picture, the retail sector is projected to pay 20% less, while large distribution warehouses are expected to pay 27% more. That is viewed as the alternative to an online sales tax. Within the limitations of the complex business rates system, Hunt went as far he reasonably could.

Fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country’s nuclear power firm, Energoatom, said. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the UN nuclear watchdog could travel to the Zaporizhzhia plant in the “coming days”. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, earlier said his team were “very, very close” to being able to go to the plant. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after the US president, Joe Biden, spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Biden congratulated him on the country’s 31st independence day, celebrated on Wednesday. Zelenskiy said he had “a great conversation” and thanked Biden for his “unwavering” support. It comes a day after Biden announced nearly $3bn in new military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment, the biggest tranche of US military aid to date. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month with no signs of abating. The Russian president’s decree appears to point to the country’s aim to replenish its military, which has been heavily damaged in Ukraine and has failed to achieve its objective to capture the capital, Kyiv. At least 25 people have been confirmed dead after a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian train station. Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday. The deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia. The Vatican’s Russia-Ukraine diplomacy suffered two setbacks on Thursday when the head of the Russian Orthodox church cancelled a meeting with Pope Francis and Ukraine summoned the papal ambassador to complain about Francis’ latest comments about the war. The pontiff upset Kyiv by including Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian nationalist TV Alexander Dugin killed by a car bomb on Sunday, as among the “innocents” who have been victimised by the “insanity of war.” Russia has accused Ukrainian intelligence in the bombing, which Ukraine denies. Latvia toppled a Soviet-era obelisk amid backlash against Russia. The concrete nearly 80-metre (260ft) obelisk topped by Soviet stars was the centrepiece of a monument to the Red Army’s victory over Nazi Germany, the latest in a series of Soviet monuments brought down after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

In brief televised remarks, Wang said China and Russia were ready to deepen their strategic cooperation. Putin said that “Russian-Chinese relations were proceeding as planned” and talked of reaching “new milestones” in areas such as bilateral trade. Putin said the two countries had “ongoing cooperation” in international affairs and expressed Russia’s gratitude to China. Earlier on Wednesday, Wang met Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, where he said he expected to reach a “new consensus” on advancing the relationship between the two allies. Xi Jinping, China’s president, is expected to visit Putin in Russia in the coming months, although an exact date has not been announced. Joe Biden has been meeting the leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a collection of nations on the most eastern parts of the Nato alliance and closest to Russia. The alliance includes Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Speaking ahead of talks Biden said it was “absolutely clear” that the US would defend “literally every inch of Nato”. Ukraine will ask Turkey and the UN this week to start talks to roll over the Black Sea grain deal, seeking an extension of at least one year that would include the ports of Mykolaiv, a senior Ukrainian official said. Yuriy Vaskov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of restoration, also said he wanted the ports of Mykolaiv included in the deal, and that Russia’s current occupation of the Kinburn spit was an obstacle. The spit of land overlooks the route that ships would use to sail from Mykolaiv’s ports into the Black Sea. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has urged member states to speed up delivery of ammunition from their stocks to Ukraine “as a matter or urgency”. Building on comments at the Munich security conference over the weekend and at Nato headquarters on Tuesday, Borrell said the EU was ”looking into the question of joint procurement” of ammunition and “how to ramp up the production capacity of the European defence industry”. A group of 10 EU member states has called for stronger action to stop Russia sourcing military parts through front companies in neighbouring countries and evading western sanctions. The 10 countries, which include France, Germany, Italy and the Baltic states, write that “2023 must be the year of success in countering circumvention”, warning that public support and international legitimacy of sanctions could wane if they are deemed ineffective. EU countries on Wednesday failed to agree on a new set of sanctions against Russia meant to be in place for the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, four diplomatic sources in Brussels have told Reuters. Russia on Wednesday expressed “deep concern” over the UN’s behaviour regarding the rotation of staff at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. In a statement, Russia’s foreign ministry said the UN nuclear body was “disrupting” the scheduled changeover of IAEA staff stationed at the plant, which is occupied by Russian forces. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv region, reported that two people were injured in Russian strikes on the city of Kharkiv on Wednesday morning. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has said a shopping mall has been struck by Ukrainian fire in the Russian town of Shebekino, severely injuring one person. Pope Francis, speaking two days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, on Wednesday called for a ceasefire and peace negotiations, saying no victory could be “built on ruins”. The International Federation of Journalists said on Wednesday it had suspended the membership of Russia’s main journalism trade union after it established branches in occupied regions of Ukraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, plans to attend in person a Nato summit taking place in Vilnius in July, Ukraine’s ambassador to Lithuania told local newswire BNS. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports that in an unspecified number of regions in Russia, some commercial radio stations broadcast air raid alerts as a result of a cyber-attack. Russia’s flagship frigate equipped with new generation hypersonic cruise missiles has arrived in the South African port of Richards Bay for exercises that will include China. Belgium has said it is investigating a Russian “spy ship” detected in the North Sea around mid-November last year. Vincent Van Quickenborne, the Belgian justice and North Sea minister, said in a statement headlined “Russian spy ship off our coast in November”. It comes after the Dutch military intelligence agency MIVD said Russia had been attempting to gain intelligence to sabotage critical infrastructure in the Dutch part of the North Sea. Speaking before a crowd of thousands in the gardens of Warsaw’s Royal Castle on Tuesday, Joe Biden hailed the resilience of Ukraine’s people and the benevolence of Poland and other western allies in helping fend off the Russian invasion. The US president said the attack on Ukraine would never be a victory for Russia, and said new sanctions against Russia will be announced this week. India does not want the G20 nations to discuss additional sanctions on Russia during its one-year presidency of the bloc, according to officials. The foreign ministers of the G7 on Tuesday said their countries would continue to impose economic costs on Russia and urged the broader international community to reject what they described as Moscow’s “brutal expansionism”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, gave a long televised national address to the joint houses of the Russian parliament on Tuesday, in which he blamed the west for starting the war in Ukraine and promised a new fund to help those who had lost loved ones in what he referred to as Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. Putin also announced the suspension of Russia’s participation in the New Start (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). The foreign ministry later said Moscow intended to continue abiding by the restrictions outlined in the treaty on the number of warheads it could have deployed. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he regretted Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start bilateral nuclear arms control treaty and urged Moscow to reconsider. Spain plans to send six 2A4 Leopard tanks to Ukraine, defence minister Margarita Robles told lawmakers. “We are repairing right now six Leopard 2A4 vehicles … with the possibility – if needed and if our allies request it – of increasing that number,” Robles said. Women in Ukraine are increasingly vulnerable to sexual violence 12 months after Russia invaded the country, with reports of abuse on the rise, according to a humanitarian organisation in the country. Women fleeing bombed houses and their home towns are reporting attacks in the home and communal shelters, said Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine country director for the International Rescue Committee. Nato must “seriously plan” for the likely future reality of a Russian-controlled Belarus, the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has warned. Vladimir Putin will “very likely secure significant gains in restoring Russian suzerainty over Belarus” and use it as a launch pad to further threaten Ukraine and Nato’s eastern flank, regardless of the outcome of his invasion of Ukraine, the ISW said in its latest update on the war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/07/mother-who-sent-son-11-on-train-out-of-ukraine-alone-thanks-slovaks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-07T20:05:49Z","webTitle":"‘Hero’: Slovaks hail boy, 11, who travelled 700 miles alone from Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/mother-who-sent-son-11-on-train-out-of-ukraine-alone-thanks-slovaks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/07/mother-who-sent-son-11-on-train-out-of-ukraine-alone-thanks-slovaks","fields":{"headline":"‘Hero’: Slovaks hail boy, 11, who travelled 700 miles alone from Ukraine","bodyText":"The mother of an 11-year-old boy from Ukraine who travelled for nearly 700 miles to Slovakia with just a plastic bag, a passport and a telephone number written on his hand has spoken of her relief at her son’s safe escape from Russian bombs. Yulia Pisetskaya said she had put her son on a train to Slovakia from Zaporizhzhia, close to the nuclear plant that came under attack from Russian forces last week, out of desperation. She had been unable to leave with him from south-east Ukraine because she was unwell and needed to look after her disabled mother. Slovakian border guards looked after the boy, who has not been named, on his arrival, according to the police, who have described him as a “hero”. He had the phone number of relatives in the Slovakian capital, Bratislava, written on his hand. The authorities were able to track them down and they have since taken him into their care. “I am very grateful that they saved the life of my child,” Pisetskaya said in a video message posted on Facebook on Sunday. “In your small country, there are people with big hearts.” She added: “I am a widow and I have more children. I want to thank the Slovak customs and volunteers who took care of my son and helped him cross the border. I am grateful you have saved my child’s life. Next to my town is a nuclear power plant that the Russians are shooting at. I couldn’t leave my mother – she can’t move on her own.” The Slovakian interior ministry said on Facebook that the boy “won everybody’s hearts with his smile, fearlessness and determination, worthy of a real hero”. They said the authorities had “kept him warm and provided him with food and drink, which they packed for his next trip”. Officials added: “Thanks to the number on his hand and a piece of paper in his waist, he managed to contact his loved ones, who came for him later, and the whole story ended well.” “He came all alone from Zaporizhzhia because his parents had to stay in Ukraine,” police spokesperson Denisa Bardyova told AFP. “The boy was cared for by many, be it policemen, soldiers, customs officers or volunteers and various religious or civil organisations.” Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia site, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which creates around 20% of Ukraine’s electricity, in the early hours of Friday. They have since taken control of the facility. • The headline of this article was amended on 8 March 2022 to render the noun as Slovaks, rather than “Slovakians”, in accordance with our style guidance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/apr/14/japanese-regulator-bans-restart-tepco-nuclear-plant-over-safety-breaches","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-14T07:42:18Z","webTitle":"Japanese regulator bans restart at nuclear plant over safety breaches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/14/japanese-regulator-bans-restart-tepco-nuclear-plant-over-safety-breaches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/apr/14/japanese-regulator-bans-restart-tepco-nuclear-plant-over-safety-breaches","fields":{"headline":"Japanese regulator bans restart at nuclear plant over safety breaches","bodyText":"The operator of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant has been prevented from restarting its only operable atomic facility after a series of safety breaches, dealing a significant blow to Japanese attempts to resume nuclear power generation. Japan’s nuclear regulator is to issue a “corrective action order” on Wednesday that would ban Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) from transporting new uranium fuel to its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant in Niigata prefecture or loading fuel rods into its reactors. The move in effect prevents Tepco from restarting the facility’s seven reactors, which it hopes would turn around its finances a decade after one of its two plants in Fukushima suffered a triple meltdown. Tepco had hoped to bring two of seven reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa – the world’s biggest nuclear power plant with a capacity of 8,212 megawatts – back online to cut its operating costs by more than $800m (£580m) a year. In March, however, it was heavily criticised after a series of safety and security breaches came to light, including an unauthorised employee accessing sensitive areas of the facility and a failure to protect nuclear materials. Media reports said Wednesday’s decision was the first time the nuclear regulation authority – which was formed after the March 2011 disaster – had in effect banned a utility from operating a nuclear power plant. Tepco has not commented on the move, but its shares fell by almost 4% in afternoon trading in Tokyo. The company has until late September to submit a report to regulators outlining improvements in the way it handles nuclear materials. The agency will assess the changes before possibly removing the corrective order, a process that could take at least a year. Tepco has said it can save $827m in fuel costs annually by restarting Kashiwazaki-Kariwa’s No 6 and 7 reactors, which have been offline since at least 2012. When all seven of its reactors are in operation, the plant can generate enough power for 16m households. Tepco faces an enormous bill for decommissioning costs and compensation claims by residents living near the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi plant. The regulator’s decision came a day after the government announced that Tepco would release more than 1m tonnes of contaminated water from Fukushima Daiichi into the Pacific Ocean, prompting an angry response from local fishers and neighbouring countries. On Wednesday, South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, instructed his country’s officials to look into ways to refer Japan’s move to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, including filing for an injunction.

Later this month the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, will set out his pitch on energy, jobs and net zero, hoping to place a green economy at the centre of his vision for revitalising the UK. But with just weeks to go, his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, admitted on Friday that the key plank of that vision – the party’s much-heralded flagship commitment to spend £28bn a year on green investment – would be delayed. She blamed the economic mess being left by the Conservative party, and insisted the target would be met in the second half of a Labour parliament. Green investment will instead start at an unspecified level and “ramp up”. Aides said the move was not a U-turn, but an act of economic realism, given the need for fiscal stability after years of Tory chaos. Economists and green campaigners were far from convinced. Several Oxford economists questioned the move and suggested that Reeves and Starmer had misunderstood the economics of green investment. Prof Cameron Hepburn, director of the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, said: “Fiscal prudence matters. Borrowing for a consumption binge is foolish, particularly in the current economic climate. But borrowing to invest in productive assets is a different matter, especially when those assets deliver cheaper energy and new jobs. The sooner we get on with decarbonising the economy, the better.” Prof Sam Fankhauser, also of the Smith School, added: “By delaying the investment, Labour will also delay the returns – economic, environmental and social.” Green campaigners were up in arms. Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics for Greenpeace UK, said: “This prevarication risks throwing in the towel on the global race in green tech, with the US, China and the EU already far ahead. It would simply be bad economics to say that we can’t afford this now, when it would pay for itself. Green infrastructure investment is now one of the best economic growth generators, and with it the opportunity to lower bills and tackle the climate crisis. Labour mustn’t let this go.” The furore over the delay to the £28bn investment promise was the latest twist in a fortnight of turmoil for Labour over its green ambitions. When Starmer laid out the first tranche of his green plans – an end to new licences for oil and gas drilling in the North Sea – to world business leaders at Davos in January, it generated little interest. But when he reiterated his stance at the end of last month, the knives were sharpened and ready – and not only from the predictable quarters. Grant Shapps, the Tory energy secretary, took to social media to accuse Starmer of being in the pocket of the Just Stop Oil protesters, and the rightwing media duly took up the same cry. They sensed an opportunity to claim that halting new licences would raise energy bills, even though this was comprehensively debunked by the chair of the Climate Change Committee, Lord Deben, who said that fuel from new fields would not flow for a decade or more, and that it would have no impact on UK prices as it would be sold to the highest bidder. Those inconvenient facts have not deterred Shapps. One Tory insider indicated the attack lines would continue, saying: “He doesn’t believe families should pay the price for making the country dependent on foreign fossil fuels from the likes of Putin, which is exactly what Labour’s Just Stop Oil-sponsored policy would do.” Attacks from political enemies could be shrugged off. Far harder to dismiss was the public outcry from unions. Two major unions – hefty donors to Labour historically – lambasted the plans. Sharon Graham of Unite called the pledge “reckless”, and Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB, said the move was “naive”. Union leaders fear losses among the 200,000-strong North Sea fossil fuel workforce, and called for a “coherent, fully funded plan for jobs” as part of any moves to question the UK’s energy future. The Labour leader stood firm on the North Sea, but a few days later offered an olive branch to unions in supporting nuclear power, a move that also conveniently distances him from his anti-nuclear predecessor Jeremy Corbyn. Starmer is also expected to woo the unions by making highly skilled green jobs a central plank of his pitch later this month, though that may be harder to do convincingly given the scaling back of the £28bn pledge. Opposition to green initiatives from within the ranks of Labour, and its usual allies, has deep roots, according to Newsom. “Parts of the Labour party don’t sufficiently grasp that green investment is as much of a vote winner as it actually is. Polling on Labour’s £28bn pledge shows it is popular across the population – people seem to understand that you need to borrow to invest on this issue,” she said. Tom Burke, a co-founder of the thinktank E3G and a veteran adviser to governments, said the Labour leader had not yet laid out a coherent green vision for his party, and the public, to rally around. “He’s trying to buy off these lobbies [such as the unions, and nuclear industry] but that just gets you back to where the Tories were. He needs his own clear political narrative,” Burke said. “Jobs is just one part. He needs to talk about incomes, raising incomes, how green policies can tackle the cost of living.” Senior Labour insiders say the North Sea pledge and the £28bn investment are just two parts of a much wider strategy, which will be laid out more compellingly when Starmer takes to the stage in Scotland later this month. They point to a series of measures already: a pledge to reach 100% clean power by 2030, and make the UK a green energy superpower; to establish Great British Energy, a homegrown publicly owned champion of green power generation; to set up a national wealth fund to create green industries; and to upgrade 19m homes through a warm homes plan for insulation and energy efficiency. What is missing from this list, green campaigners worry, is much commitment to the other side of green policy: the natural environment. Within the shadow cabinet, the focus on nature is the purview of Jim McMahon, the shadow minister for environment and rural affairs, who many feel has made little impact. Starmer recognises that the countryside must be a key part of his strategy. The limited appeal of his predecessor was mainly to young urban voters. But Labour’s thumping majorities in English cities – such as Corbyn’s own 64% vote share in Islington North – are wasted in the UK’s first-past-the-post system. With an overall vote share of 43.6% in 2019, the Conservatives were able to win an 80-seat majority partly through scores of rural and semi-rural constituencies with much smaller majorities. “The path to electoral victory runs through rural seats,” said one former shadow minister. Starmer’s advisers have long understood that he needs a message for the shires, and in 2021 and 2023 he headed for the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) conference to proclaim farming was “in my DNA”. He met a receptive audience, battered by Brexit, supermarkets and soaring input costs. Minette Batters, president of the NFU, said she was impressed. “We need to see clarity on Labour policy, but they’ve been very engaged,” she said. “Keir has visited my farm. They know, as do all parties, that the rural vote will matter at the next general election.” Yet farmers, rural linchpins though they appear, make up only a minority of voters in rural and semi-rural constituencies, and their needs are sometimes at odds with those of the rest of the public. Take sewage. The scandal, years in the making, of routine releases of raw sewage from the privatised water companies is likely to be a key flashpoint for voters, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats vying to come down hard on what is obviously a Tory weak spot. But while the misdeeds of water companies have rightly grabbed the headlines, the other major cause of pollution and ecological death for rivers and streams is runoff from agriculture. Farmers have gone largely unpunished by this government, which has shrunk the number of inspectors and created a virtual indemnity for farmers. Intensive farming is also behind the precipitous decline of wildlife, from farmland birds and small mammals to insects and plant species. Labour has vowed to reform the environmental land management system of payments for farmers. But unless there is more money for farmers to switch to less intensive, more ecologically sound practices, then there is little chance of stemming the nature losses, let alone hitting the target of preserving 30% of the UK’s biodiversity by 2030. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said: “[Starmer] can’t U-turn on nature because Labour has not yet constructed a strong, authentic narrative on nature to U-turn on. Why not? The pandemic showed the depth of people’s appreciation of the natural world, and that’s something to build on. Labour should be championing access to nature, which is good for health, and would reduce pressure on the NHS, including mental health services. But they’ve been curiously silent on nature.” When Starmer sets out his green vision this month, his low-carbon efforts will take centre stage, and anger over the delay to the £28bn investment may have died down. But if the Labour leader wants a genuine green strategy, to get the UK to net zero and protect and restore the natural environment, then the storms of the past fortnight will be just the beginning. Pursuing net zero and protecting nature involve taking on vast ranks of vested interests: farmers; the car lobby, who will label any attempt to tackle transport emissions as “a war on motorists”; while addressing aviation will threaten foreign holidays. Gas boilers will have to go, provoking resistance from boiler makers and tens of thousands of plumbers and heating installers, as well as housing developers and private landlords who have little enthusiasm for heat pumps or insulation. Even companies that loudly claim to be green need to be held to account. If Starmer is serious about leading Labour to a greener future, he will have to be prepared to make far more enemies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/feb/25/how-can-europe-wean-itself-off-russian-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-25T18:41:52Z","webTitle":"How can Europe wean itself off Russian gas?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/how-can-europe-wean-itself-off-russian-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/feb/25/how-can-europe-wean-itself-off-russian-gas","fields":{"headline":"How can Europe wean itself off Russian gas?","bodyText":"As Boris Johnson told parliament that Europe must wean itself off Russian gas – to loosen Vladimir Putin’s “grip on western politics” – the Nikolay Zubov tanker was making its way back from British waters to the port of Sabetta, in northern Siberia. The 300m-long vessel had recently dropped off a consignment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the Isle of Grain terminal, in the Thames Estuary, operated by the National Grid. Steaming north under a Cypriot “flag of convenience”, it charted a course for Russia’s Arctic coast, near the vast $27bn (£20bn) Yamal gas facility, personally inaugurated by Putin in 2017. Britain gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia, either flowing through subsea interconnector pipelines or arriving by boat at the Isle of Grain and two further LNG facilities at Milford Haven, South Wales. In the EU, whose gas market is so intermeshed with Britain’s that it effectively determines the prices paid by UK end users, the picture is very different. Russia exports between 150bn and 190bn cubic metres of gas to Europe each year, typically fulfilling 30-40% of demand across the continent. It accounts for 65% of imports into Europe’s economic powerhouse Germany and 100% for countries such as Latvia and Czech Republic. The obstacles to replacing Russian supplies are logistical, financial and political. So, if Europe – and by extension the UK – want to reduce their reliance on Putin’s pumps, what are the options and how feasible are they, particularly in the short term? Liquefied natural gas LNG is super-chilled gas, condensed into liquid form and transported by ship and “regasified” at specialist terminals. Ports including Milford Haven and Grain – Europe’s biggest LNG terminal – take regular shipments. In 2020, Russian LNG accounted for 3% of total UK gas supply and, so far at least, there is no sign of shipments being affected by sanctions. European ports including Montoir-de-Bretagne in France, Zeebrugge in Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands have also welcomed Siberian visitors of late. Figures provided by Argus show that Russia has supplied 16% of Europe’s LNG since February 2020. But Russia doesn’t come close to being one of the biggest LNG exporters, a list headed by the US, Qatar and Australia. Qatar is reportedly willing to increase LNG exports to Europe and, even now, shipments of LNG from the US are moored off Milford Haven, at the South Hook and Dragon terminals. On paper, Europe has the capacity to import an extra 147bn cubic metres of LNG a year, according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie, enough to replace Russian pipeline gas entirely. But Wood Mackenzie’s European gas analyst Graham Freedman said the switch would take “at least a decade” in practice, not least due to a lack of onward infrastructure in the right place. Germany, Europe’s biggest gas market, has no LNG import terminals. Even a temporary switch would be hugely expensive. Tom Marzec-Manser, lead European gas analyst at energy consultancy ICIS, pointed out that LNG production is limited and consignments go to the highest bidder. European countries already wrestling with sky-high prices would have to outbid increasingly gas-hungry Asian economies. “It’s an incredibly expensive short-term gap filler,” he said. Alternative pipelines Britain and Norway’s North Sea fields, not to mention onshore resources in the Netherlands, contain sizeable reserves but scope for upping the flow is limited. Marzec-Manser said Norwegian state energy firm Equinor has raised production but there’s “not much more they can do”. UK North Sea output is already on the decline, with limited headroom for a short-term increase. The Netherland’s’ vast Groningen field is an option in theory but probably not in practice, say analysts at Jefferies. It could provide 13bn cubic metres, equivalent to 9% of Russian supply. But the Dutch government is winding down production after drilling was found to be causing earthquakes. Reversing that decision looks politically unpalatable. Nuclear power or coal Nuclear power reduces reliance on gas for electricity and the UK generates up to 20% of its power that way. While much of the fleet is due to be retired by 2025, the government has thrown its weight behind rebuilding that capacity. But doing so takes time and does little to replace gas in cooking or heating homes. France gets 70% of its power from nuclear energy, affording it much more protection from volatile gas prices. But Germany announced its withdrawal from nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and in 2019 said it would pull the plug on coal-fired plants. Those decisions have left it more dependent than most major economies on Russian gas. In practice, Germany is unlikely to change its mind on decommissioning nuclear power stations. Given the climate crisis, few European countries are minded to turn back to coal. Fracking The UK government ordered a moratorium on all new fracking wells in 2019 but the gas price crisis has brought advocates out of the woodwork. They include Lord Frost – who presided over the UK’s Brexit negotiations – and Viscount Ridley, who chaired Northern Rock when it collapsed. The idea is that the UK could mimic the shale gas revolution that has transformed the US into a net energy exporter. Experts say otherwise – that fracking the way out of the Ukraine crisis doesn’t make geological, logistical, economic or political sense. Michael Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick Business School, points out that the UK’s reserves are harder to tap geologically than those in the US. Unlike the US, potential sites are surrounded by densely populated areas that are governed by strict planning laws and populated by people who don’t actually support fracking, making it politically impossible. Concerns about water and noise pollution persist and even if those were overcome, fracking would have vanishingly little impact on European wholesale prices, while also taking years to develop. “By the time we did it, we probably wouldn’t need the gas,” said Bradshaw. Renewables and home insulation Ultimately, renewable energy and decreased demand, by improving home energy efficiency through better insulation, offers the most obvious long-term solution. However, this depends on major investment and improvement in technologies such as battery storage, which makes up for the intermittency in supply from technologies such as wind power. Marzec-Manser said that the Ukraine crisis might well motivate Europe to go hell for leather for a renewable future but that it is already moving faster than any other part of the world. “It’s like trying to move into sixth gear when your car only has five gears,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/02/ukraine-declares-full-control-of-lyman-after-russian-forces-pull-out","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-02T14:45:23Z","webTitle":"Ukraine declares full control of Lyman after Russian forces pull out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/02/ukraine-declares-full-control-of-lyman-after-russian-forces-pull-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/02/ukraine-declares-full-control-of-lyman-after-russian-forces-pull-out","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine declares full control of Lyman after Russian forces pull out","bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed Ukraine has “fully cleared” Russian forces from the key eastern city of Lyman, a day after Moscow admitted its troops had pulled out after they were encircled. In a short video clip on his Telegram channel, Zelenskiy thanked serving Ukrainian troops for liberating Lyman. “As of 1230 [Kyiv] local time Lyman is completely cleared,” he said, adding: “Glory to Ukraine.” Earlier the Ukrainian president said his army would continue its offensive in the south and east and would “return back” all of the territory occupied by Russia, including Crimea. He suggested Russian generals were now “biting each other” after a series of embarrassing setbacks. Their loss of Lyman four months after Russian servicemen seized the city in the Donetsk oblast amounts to a humiliating moment for Vladimir Putin. On Friday, in a move rejected by the international community, he annexed Donetsk together with three other Ukrainian regions, and said they were a part of Russia “for ever”. Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s armed forces would continue to advance. He predicted more “mismatches” between Putin’s rhetoric and the reality on the battlefield. Reports suggested Ukrainian troops were pushing forward from Lyman towards the cities of Svatove and Kreminna. In Lyman, Ukrainian soldiers celebrated their victory. They reclaimed the police station and burned a Russian tricolour in a courtyard. One posted a jubilant video outside the local office of Denis Pushilin, the Kremlin-appointed head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, or DNR. Pushilin was one of four pro-Russian “leaders” who attended a ceremony in Moscow on Friday where an annexation treaty was signed, with Russia’s political elite looking on. Putin promised to use “all means” to defend the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions – an apparent threat to use nuclear weapons. It was unclear how many Russians were killed during their chaotic retreat from Lyman. Video showed burned-out vehicles, personal belongings and dead soldiers strewn along a forest road. Ukrainian forces recovered at least one T-72 tank which had suffered minor damage. In an intelligence briefing, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said Russia’s forces “probably suffered heavy casualties” as they left the city. Lyman was important because it “commands a key road crossing over the Siversky Donetsk River behind which Russia has been trying to consolidate its defences,” it added. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said Ukraine’s counter-offensive in the Donbas region would carry on. “In the near future we are waiting for the start of a large-scale process of de-occupation in Luhansk oblast,” he said. Local collaborators were “panicking”, he added. Ukraine also claimed to have liberated a village in the south of the country, where its troops have been pressing on Russian positions around the city of Kherson. Overnight they seized the village of Zolotaya Balka, next to the Dnipro River. A video shows a local resident posing with a soldier waving a Ukrainian flag. Social media channels in Kherson reported that Ukrainian troops had also liberated the “melon” – a concrete sign celebrating the region’s most famous fruit. The melon sculpture marked the administrative border. Next to it were abandoned Russian foxholes and ammunition cases. Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces had destroyed seven Ukrainian artillery and missile depots in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and Donetsk provinces. It said the guidance radar for a S-300 air defence missile system had also been destroyed near Nova Kaluha in the Kherson region, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, after a day of silence Moscow confirmed that it had “temporarily detained” the head of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which it has occupied since March. A Russian patrol abducted Ihor Murashov on Friday afternoon while he was on his way to work. Russia is trying to transfer the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Russian energy firm Rosatom, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, Petro Kotin, has told the BBC. It is reportedly compelling employees who live in the city of Enerhodar to sign Russian contracts. The International Atomic Energy Agency called on Russia to free Murashov. His detention posed a threat to safety and security, it said. “IAEA director general Rafael Grossi expressed the hope that Mr Murashov will return to his family safely and promptly and will be able to resume his important functions at the plant,” the agency tweeted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/05/south-korea-apologises-after-missile-fired-in-response-to-north-korea-test-crashes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-05T03:25:04Z","webTitle":"South Korea apologises after missile fired in response to North Korea test crashes ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/05/south-korea-apologises-after-missile-fired-in-response-to-north-korea-test-crashes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/05/south-korea-apologises-after-missile-fired-in-response-to-north-korea-test-crashes","fields":{"headline":"South Korea apologises after missile fired in response to North Korea test crashes ","bodyText":"South Korea’s military has apologised after a missile it launched during a drill on Tuesday malfunctioned and crashed to the ground, causing alarm among nearby residents who thought they were under attack from North Korea, which had test launched a missile earlier in the day. The live-fire drill, involving South Korea and the US, was supposed to be a show of strength by the allies, hours after the North sent an intermediate-range missile over northern Japan. Instead, it ended in embarrassment when a short-range Hyumoo-2 ballistic missile crashed to the ground inside an air force base near the South Korean coastal city of Gangneung. Although the missile did not explode, the noise and subsequent fire caused some Gangneung residents to believe the North had launched an attack, according to media reports. There were no reports of injuries. The South Korean military acknowledged the accident hours after internet users posted videos showing an orange ball of flames emerging from an area they described as near a Gangneung air force base. The military said it was investigating what had caused the “abnormal flight” of the South Korean missile – a key part of its preemptive and retaliatory strike strategies against the North. The accident occurred as the South Korean and US militaries fired a volley of missiles into the East Sea – also known as the Sea of Japan – in response to North Korea firing a ballistic missile over Japan for the first time in five years. The nuclear-armed state launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile that flew for a record distance of 4,600km (2,850 miles) at n altitude of 1,000km, in its most provocative weapons demonstration in years. That range puts the US Pacific territory of Guam, homes to American military bases, within striking distance. The missile landed in the Pacific Ocean about 3,200km east of Japan. Japan’s government issued an alert urging residents to take cover as the missile passed high over the northernmost main island of Hokkaido and Aomori prefecture. The US and South Korean militaries fired two ATACMS short-range ballistic missiles into the water “to precisely strike a virtual target,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. The drills “showed the ability and readiness to neutralise the origin of the provocation while maintaining a constant monitoring posture,” it said in a statement. On Tuesday, South Korean and US fighter jets had carried out a bombing drill at a target in the Yellow Sea. The drills aim to “make sure that we have the military capabilities at the ready to respond to provocations by the North if it comes to that,” US national security council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN. “It shouldn’t come to that. We have made it clear to (North Korean leader) Kim Jong-un we’re willing to sit down with no preconditions. We want to see the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” he said. “He hasn’t shown an inclination to move in that direction – and quite frankly he’s moving in the opposite direction by continuing to conduct these missile tests, which are violations of Security Council resolutions.” Pyongyang’s latest launch is part of a record year of sanctions-busting weapons tests by the isolated regime, which recently revised its laws to declare itself an “irreversible” nuclear power. US president Joe Biden and Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida condemned North Korea’s latest launch “in the strongest terms”. South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol called the launch a “provocation”, and vowed a “stern response”. The Tuesday test was Pyongyang’s fifth missile launch in 10 days. North Korea does not routinely comment on its weapons tests in state media. South Korean and US officials have been warning for months that Kim is preparing to conduct another nuclear test, saying last week that this could happen soon after Pyongyang’s key ally China holds a Communist party congress from 16 October. US vice-president Kamala Harris visited Seoul last week and toured the heavily fortified demilitarised zone that divides the Korean peninsula, on a trip to underscore her country’s commitment to South Korea’s defence. About 28,500 US troops are stationed in South Korea to help protect it from the North."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jun/24/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-121-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-24T14:07:47Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 121 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-121-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jun/24/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-121-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 121 of the invasion","bodyText":"The last Ukrainian forces fighting in the heavily contested eastern city of Sievierodonetsk have been ordered to withdraw in order to avoid being encircled, as fears grow that the neighbouring city of Lysychansk could also fall to Russia within days. The anticipated loss of Sievierodonetsk is the latest battlefield reverse for Kyiv after its defeat in the port city of Mariupol. According to some estimates about 12,000 civilians remain in Sievierodonetsk, out of a prewar population of 160,000. All three bridges offering escape routes west over the Siverskyi Donets River to the twin city of Lysychansk have been destroyed in fighting, and the mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, says the humanitarian situation is critical. The Luhansk governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on Friday: “The situation right now is as such that staying at these destroyed positions just for the sake of being there doesn’t make sense.” He said Ukrainian forces had “received the order to retreat to new positions and continue fighting there”, but did not give further details. Russians were also advancing toward Lysychansk from Zolote and Toshkivka, and Russian reconnaissance units had been conducting forays on the city edges but were driven out by its defenders, he added. An official in the Russian-installed administration of Ukraine’s occupied Kherson region was killed in an apparent assassination when his car exploded as he got into it. Dmitry Savluchenko was head of the families, youth, and sports department of the Kherson Military-Civilian Administration. The Kremlin has described the attack as “nothing but an act of terrorism”. European leaders granted Ukraine candidate status late on Thursday, in a historic decision that opens the door to EU membership for the war-torn country and deals a blow to Vladimir Putin. EU leaders meeting in Brussels approved Ukraine’s candidate status nearly four months after the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, launched his country’s bid to join the bloc in the early days of the Russian invasion. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, declared it was “a good day for Europe”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said it was historic decision that sent “a strong signal towards Russia in the current geopolitical context”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, immediately welcomed the move, saying: “Ukraine’s future is in the EU.” “It’s a victory … we have been waiting for 120 days and 30 years,” he added, referring to the duration of the war and the decades since Ukraine became independent on the breakup of the Soviet Union. “And now we will defeat the enemy.” The UN nuclear watchdog has said it is increasingly concerned about the welfare of Ukrainian staff at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said: “The IAEA is aware of recent reports in the media and elsewhere indicating a deteriorating situation for Ukrainian staff at the country’s largest nuclear power plant.” Moscow’s foreign ministry blamed the United States for a Lithuanian ban on sanctioned goods crossing from the Russian mainland to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Lithuania has prevented goods that are banned by EU sanctions from transiting its territory by rail. Russia has threatened repercussions. G7 foreign ministers called on Russia to “cease its attacks and threatening actions” and to unblock the Ukrainian Black Sea ports for food exports. Russia is exacerbating food insecurity with its blockades and bombing attacks on key infrastructure in Ukraine, they said in a statement. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said Europe needs to ramp up efforts to cut its dependency from Russian fossil fuel imports. The US will send another $450m in military aid to Ukraine, including some additional medium-range rocket systems. The latest package includes four high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and tens of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition as well as patrol boats, Pentagon officials announced on Thursday. With the latest shipments, the US contribution to Ukraine’s military will amount to $6.1bn so far, White House spokesperson, John Kirby, added. More than 150 cultural sites in Ukraine have been partially or totally destroyed, according to a Unesco report. The damage includes 70 religious buildings, 30 historical buildings, 18 cultural centres, 15 monuments, 12 museums and seven libraries. Zelenskiy addressed crowds at Glastonbury festival in the UK and asked them to “spread the truth about Russia’s war” and “prove that freedom always wins”. In a video message to festivalgoers, Zelenskiy said people in Ukraine wanted to “live the life as we used to, enjoy freedom and this wonderful summer”. Ukraine is recording 200 to 300 war crimes committed by Russian forces on its territory every day, the prosecutor general has claimed. “War crimes are our trouble. Every day we have 200 to 300 of them … We have a duty: when there is a crime, we have to start an investigation,” Iryna Venediktova told Ukrainian television. Ukraine has held a preliminary hearing in its first trial of a Russian soldier charged with raping a Ukrainian woman during Moscow’s invasion – the first of what could be dozens of such cases. The suspect, Mikhail Romanov, 32, who will be tried in absentia, is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region outside Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while threatening her and her child. The Russian navy has been given orders to lay mines at the ports of Odesa and Ochakiv, and has already mined the Dnieper River, as part of a blockade of Ukrainian grain exports, according to newly declassified US intelligence. The US embassy in Russia has been pressing the Kremlin this week to reveal the whereabouts of two Alabama men captured in Ukraine, according to the mother of one of the taken Americans. Lois “Bunny” Drueke also said that her son, Alexander Drueke, and the other captured US military veteran, Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, were not mercenaries but volunteers, pushing back on statements from a Kremlin spokesperson who said the American pair were facing execution."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/15/aims-software-avatars-team-jorge-disinformation-fake-profiles","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-15T04:00:03Z","webTitle":"‘Aims’: the software for hire that can control 30,000 fake online profiles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/15/aims-software-avatars-team-jorge-disinformation-fake-profiles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/15/aims-software-avatars-team-jorge-disinformation-fake-profiles","fields":{"headline":"‘Aims’: the software for hire that can control 30,000 fake online profiles","bodyText":"At first glance, the Twitter user “Canaelan” looks ordinary enough. He has tweeted on everything from basketball to Taylor Swift, Tottenham Hotspur football club to the price of a KitKat. The profile shows a friendly-looking blond man with a stubbly beard and glasses who, it indicates, lives in Sheffield. The background: a winking owl. Canaelan is, in fact, a non-human bot linked to a vast army of fake social media profiles controlled by a software designed to spread “propaganda”. Advanced Impact Media Solutions, or Aims, which controls more than 30,000 fake social media profiles, can be used to spread disinformation at scale and at speed. It is sold by “Team Jorge”, a unit of disinformation operatives based in Israel. Tal Hanan, who runs the covert group using the pseudonym “Jorge”, told undercover reporters that they sold access to their software to unnamed intelligence agencies, political parties and corporate clients. One appears to have been sold to a client who wanted to discredit the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), a statutory watchdog. On 18 October 2020, the ICO ruled that the government should reveal which companies were awarded multimillion-pound contracts to supply PPE after being entered into a “VIP” lane for politically connected companies. “This is politically motivated, it’s clear!” Canaelan lamented on Twitter two days later. That comment was part of a chorus of disapproval generated by the bots, who seemed aghast. “Information Commissioner tries everything to destroy the government,” one said, while another described the ruling as a “desperate act”. All of the “replies” under that and other tweets were united in their outrage at the ICO, which they described as “a waste of time” and “lame”. As the replies continued, they became more trenchant, making wild and false accusations against the ICO about bribes, corruption and links to the far right. Others just seemed nonplussed by the ICO’s insistence on transparency over the government’s pandemic procurement. “This is so typical from the UK …” one bot opined, “focusing on the wrong things.” It is not known who commissioned Team Jorge to unleash the bots on the ICO, or why. Hanan did not respond to detailed requests for comment but said: “To be clear, I deny any wrongdoing.” The ICO campaign appears to have been relatively short-lived compared with others around the world that reporters have been able to link to Team Jorge’s Aims software, which is much more than a bot-controlling programme. Each avatar, according to a demonstration Hanan gave the undercover reporters, is given a multifaceted digital backstory. Aims enables the creation of accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Telegram, Gmail, Instagram and YouTube. Some even have Amazon accounts with credit cards, bitcoin wallets and Airbnb accounts. Hanan told the undercover reporters his avatars mimicked human behaviour and their posts were powered by artificial intelligence. Using the Aims-linked avatars revealed by Team Jorge in presentations and videos, reporters at the Guardian, Le Monde and Der Spiegel were able to identify a much wider network of 2,000 Aims-linked bots on Facebook and Twitter. We then traced their activity across the internet, identifying their involvement in what appeared to be mostly commercial disputes in about 20 countries including the UK, US, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Greece, Panama, Senegal, Mexico, Morocco, India, the United Arab Emirates, Zimbabwe, Belarus and Ecuador. The analysis revealed a vast array of bot activity, with Aims’ fake social media profiles getting involved in a dispute in California over nuclear power; a #MeToo controversy in Canada; a campaign in France involving a Qatari UN official; and an election in Senegal. One of the Aims-backed campaigns targeted a Monaco-based superyacht company, accusing it of having direct links to several Russian oligarchs who were subject to sanctions. We also identified real-world events that appeared to have been staged to provide ammunition that could be leveraged in social media campaigns. One case involved a fake protest staged outside a company headquarters on Regent Street, central London. Three masked activists in baseball caps, sunglasses and masks filmed themselves waving placards. A similar leafletting campaign was staged near the Eiffel Tower in Paris, before being circulated on social media by Aims bots. It is not possible to know who the clients were in any of the campaigns, or even what their objective was. However, what seems clear is that the avatars peddling propaganda are doing so with the help of stolen photographs of real people. The photo of a beaming man on Canaelan’s Twitter bio, the Guardian has established, was taken from the real Twitter page of Tom Van Rooijen, 25, a freelance Dutch journalist living in the Netherlands. Informed about the identity theft by the Guardian, Van Rooijen said he felt “quite uncomfortable” seeing his face beside a tweet expressing views he disagreed with. “I give a lot of workshops to school classes about news, media, journalism and fake news. I teach children weekly that their identity can be stolen by a Twitter bot,” he said. “I never thought my own identity would be stolen by a bot.” Van Rooijen is likely to be among tens of thousands of unsuspecting victims whose images have been harvested by Team Jorge. Other techniques are also used to lend the avatars credibility and avoid the bot-detection systems created by tech platforms. Hanan said his bots were linked to SMS-verified phone numbers, and some even had credit cards. Aims also has different groups of avatars with various nationalities and languages, with evidence they have been pushing narratives in Russian, Spanish, French and Japanese. Those involved in the ICO campaign had been made to seem British, retweeting news articles from the Guardian, BBC, the Daily Mail and the Telegraph. They showed an interest in the royal family, Glastonbury and Liz Truss’s performance as foreign minister, and posted lighthearted jokes about British weather and food, as well as scenic photos from Wiltshire and Yorkshire. Those backgrounds provided some credibility when, later, they suddenly began expressing views about the UK’s data watchdog. Twitter declined to comment. Meta, the owner of Facebook, this week took down Aims-linked bots on its platform after reporters shared a sample of the fake accounts with the company. On Tuesday, a Meta spokesperson connected the Aims bots to others that were linked in 2019 to another, now-defunct Israeli firm which it banned from the platform. “This latest activity is an attempt by some of the same individuals to come back and we removed them for violating our policies,” the spokesperson said. “The group’s latest activity appears to have centred around running fake petitions on the internet or seeding fabricated stories in mainstream media outlets.” For all of their apparent sophistication, some Aims avatars betrayed giveaways. One of the Twitter bots involved in UK campaigns alongside Canaelan was “Alexander”, whose profile picture showed a young man with a sculpted beard in a white beanie hat. The background: orange tulips beside a chirpy slogan “Be happy”. And his profile bio consisted of two short sentences that hinted at an interest in falsehoods – and how to make them convincing: “The difference between fiction and reality?’ Fiction has to make sense.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/08/germany-to-extend-energy-subsidies-to-smaller-firms-amid-closure-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T15:51:33Z","webTitle":"Germany to extend energy subsidies to smaller firms amid closure fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/08/germany-to-extend-energy-subsidies-to-smaller-firms-amid-closure-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/08/germany-to-extend-energy-subsidies-to-smaller-firms-amid-closure-fears","fields":{"headline":"Germany to extend energy subsidies to smaller firms amid closure fears","bodyText":"Germany plans to extend a scheme subsidising energy costs for big businesses that are heavily dependent on energy to all small and medium-sized businesses, as part of a package of measures designed to avoid a wave of insolvencies. Robert Habeck, the economy minister, said he anticipated that the subsidies would be in place for a limited time, until efforts on the national and European level to bring down high electricity and gas prices took effect. He said the government would be at pains to “change the design of the electricity market so that cheaper costs can be transferred to consumers”. The aim, he said, was to split the price of electricity from the price of gas. Both have risen markedly since Russia invaded Ukraine and supplies of Russian gas to Germany plummeted, stopping altogether a week ago. From October the government plans to financially compensate companies that lower their gas consumption. In some cases, companies are expected to temporarily stop production. Lobby groups have said increasing numbers of businesses are facing existential crises. On Thursday, bakers protested against soaring energy bills that many said threatened them with closure. Two leading economic institutes raised fears of a recession in Europe’s largest economy, lowering their forecasts for 2023 to a shrinkage of between 0.7% and 1.4%, after growth expectations announced in June of between 2% and 3.3%. Only one, RWI Essen, predicted growth, of about 0.8%. Habeck told the Bundestag there was a need to address the “demand shock” that would affect consumers and businesses, as many people were already reducing their spending to protect themselves against inflation. “We will embrace measures to ensure that the people in Germany will have enough money to be able to consume,” Habeck said, without giving further detail. Peter Adrian, the president of the German Chamber of Industry and Trade (DIHK), earlier told German media that many companies were in fear for their survival. “Increasing numbers of businesses have been telling us that they are no longer getting supply contracts for electricity or gas. They are having the tap closed on them, in the truest sense of the word,” he said. “Without energy, however, the economy will grind to a halt.” The government has pledged to temporarily relax rules on insolvency. A spokesperson for the justice ministry told the financial daily Handelsblatt that the change would happen “speedily”. He said the measure should help companies “which are in good health and long-term able to survive due to the changed parameters”. He said companies would be given the chance to “adapt their business models” to the changing circumstances. Habeck said he was optimistic that Germany would rise to the challenge, including the need to free itself from the stranglehold of Russia. Until recently, Germany had aimed to become independent from supplies of Russian gas by 2024. However, since Moscow turned off the remaining flow last Wednesday, citing the need for maintenance work, the separation has come about far quicker. “We have now been independent from Russian gas for a week, and our storage facilities are continuing to fill up,” he said, adding that the costs of gas since the switch-off were high “but they haven’t exploded”. Gas storage at 47 subterranean facilities across the country stood at about 87% on Thursday. The facilities can take about 28% of the amount of gas that Germany uses in an average year. EU energy ministers are due to meet on Friday to consider a price cap for Russian gas as well as a limit on the revenue of other energy sources, with a potential differentiation between renewable energy and energy from conventional coal and nuclear power plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-arrives-in-berlin-after-germany-announces-further-27bn-of-military-aid","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-14T21:02:06Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war – as it happened: Zelenskiy arrives in France to meet Macron after Germany visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-arrives-in-berlin-after-germany-announces-further-27bn-of-military-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-arrives-in-berlin-after-germany-announces-further-27bn-of-military-aid","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war – as it happened: Zelenskiy arrives in France to meet Macron after Germany visit","bodyText":"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy landed in Paris on Sunday ahead of his bilateral talks with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. “Paris. With each visit, Ukraine’s defense and offensive capabilities are expanding,” Zelensky tweeted as he arrived on Sunday evening at the airbase of Villacoublay southwest of Paris. The French leader’s office said the pair would discuss France’s “support” in responding to “Ukraine’s urgent military and humanitarian needs” during a dinner at the presidential palace. During his visit to Germany, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was awarded the prestigious Charlemagne prize on behalf of the Ukrainian people on Sunday in honour of services to Europe, the Associated Press reports. Zelenskiy received the award, which honours services to European unification, in the western city of Aachen with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after the two leaders held talks in Berlin. Russia has “already lost geopolitically” its war in Ukraine and is transforming into a vassal state of China, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in an interview with Opinion newspaper published on Sunday. “De facto, it has entered a form of subservience with regards to China and has lost its access to the Baltic, which was critical, because it prompted the decision by Sweden and Finland to join Nato,” said Macron. Zelenskiy thanked Germany for its support and what he called the largest military aid package since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion as he met with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin. The trip came after the German government announced a new military package worth €2.7bn as Ukrainian forces prepare for a counteroffensive to reclaim territory captured by Russia. The UK Ministry of Defence said Russian forces were much diminished since the start of the war, with troops consisting of mostly poorly trained mobilised reservists and increasingly reliant on antiquated equipment, with many of its units severely under strength. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy landed in Paris on Sunday ahead of his bilateral talks with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. “Paris. With each visit, Ukraine’s defense and offensive capabilities are expanding,” Zelensky tweeted as he arrived on Sunday evening at the airbase of Villacoublay southwest of Paris, Agence France-Presse reports. “The ties with Europe are getting stronger, and the pressure on Russia is growing.” Macron shortly afterwards welcomed Zelensky to the Elysee Palace, for the second time since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February last year. The French leader’s office said the pair would discuss France’s “support” in responding to “Ukraine’s urgent military and humanitarian needs” during a dinner at the presidential palace. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived in France ahead of his bilateral talks with French president Emmanuel Macron, Reuters reports. He was welcomed by the French prime minister and the French foreign minister. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will make a surprise visit to Paris for talks on Sunday night with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Macron’s office announced the Paris leg of Zelenskiy’s trip, and France dispatched a plane to pick up Zelenskiy in Germany, where he met the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, earlier on Sunday, the Associated Press reports. Macron’s office said the two leaders will hold talks over dinner and that Macron will “reaffirm France and Europe’s unwavering support to reestablish Ukraine in its legitimate rights and to defend its fundamental interests”. During his visit to Germany, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was awarded the prestigious Charlemagne prize on behalf of the Ukrainian people on Sunday in honour of services to Europe, the Associated Press reports. Zelenskiy received the award, which honours services to European unification, in the western city of Aachen with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after the two leaders held talks in Berlin. At the awards ceremony in Aachen town hall, Zelenskiy was met with standing ovation. “Ukrainians will always make Europe stronger,” Zelenskiy said, addressing a crowd that included the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. “Ukraine is proposing a victory not just in this war but a victory over aggression, annexations, deportations over the catastrophe of genocide, anywhere throughout the world,” he said. Scholz reaffirmed Germany’s support for Ukraine’s aspirations to join the EU and said that Russian aggression will not deter Ukraine. “Vladimir Putin may have thought he could force the Ukrainian nation off its path to Europe through violence, but all his tanks, drones and rocket launchers have had quite the opposite effect,” said Scholz. Russia has “already lost geopolitically” its war in Ukraine and is transforming into a vassal state of China, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in an interview with Opinion newspaper published on Sunday, the Associated Press reports. “De facto, it has entered a form of subservience with regards to China and has lost its access to the Baltic, which was critical, because it prompted the decision by Sweden and Finland to join Nato,” said Macron. “This was unthinkable just two years ago. So it’s already a geopolitical defeat,” Macron said ahead of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to Paris later on Sunday. “Let’s be clear, Russia must not win this war militarily. So it’s up to us to see how to help the Ukrainians with their counteroffensive, and how to prepare the issue of security guarantees in the negotiations that will inevitably take place,” he said. “I’ve always said that in the end, Europe’s security architecture will have to fully defend Ukraine. But it must also envisage non-confrontation with Russia and rebuild a sustainable balance of forces,” he said, adding: “But there are still many steps that must be taken before we get to that.” Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy visited Germany for the first time since the Russian invasion. Zelenskiy thanked Germany for its support and what he called the largest military aid package since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion as he met with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin. The trip came after the German government announced a new military package worth €2.7bn as Ukrainian forces prepare for a counteroffensive to reclaim territory captured by Russia. The UK Ministry of Defence said Russian forces were much diminished since the start of the war, with troops consisting of mostly poorly trained mobilised reservists and increasingly reliant on antiquated equipment, with many of its units severely under strength. President Zelenskiy is set to continue his whistle-stop tour of Europe, with French media reporting that the Ukrainian leader is expected to arrive in France later on Sunday. It appears that president Zelenskiy is set to continue his whistle-stop tour of Europe, with French media reporting that the Ukrainian leader is expected to arrive in France later today. Le Figaro said Zelenskiy would be greeted at the Vélizy-Villacoublay airport in Paris by the French prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, and the foreign minister, Catherine Colonna. Ukraine has recaptured 10 miles around Bakhmut over three days, according to a US thinktank. The Institute for the Study of War said 10.5 square miles were recaptured, while Russian military bloggers said attacks to the west safeguarded Ukrainian access to the city via an important highway. After reports that Volodymyr Zelenskiy has plotted attacks inside Russia in private meetings with top military aides (see 11.38), the Ukrainian president has insisted he has no plans to hit targets in Russia. After talks in Berlin with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, he said: We are not attacking Russian territory. We are preparing a counterattack to de-occupy the illegitimately conquered territories. Russia has accused Ukraine of hitting targets inside Russia, including attempting a drone strike on the Kremlin with the aim of killing the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, earlier this month. Ukraine denies the accusations, but says it has the right to use force and other means to remove Russian forces from its territories. Zelenskiy is now heading to the western German city of Aachen, where he and the Ukrainian people will be given the Charlemagne prize – an honour awarded for efforts to foster European unity. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, are also due to attend the ceremony in Aachen, ahead of an EU summit in Reykjavik on Tuesday, followed by the G7 gathering of world leaders in Hiroshima, Japan. The Russian Ministry of Defence has reported the death of two of its colonels on 13-14 May in the Bakhmut area. The Financial Times’ Christopher Hope adds that the Russian colonels were killed by Ukrainian forces in the area of Bakhmut. They were Col Vyacheslav Makarov, commander of the 4th motorised rifle brigade, and Col Yevgeny Brovko, the deputy commander of the army corps for military-political work. The Russian Defence Ministry said Makarov died on the way to a hospital after being wounded during a fight south of Ivanivske village, to the west of Bakhmut, where Ukrainian forces recaptured land this week. Brovko was killed in shelling and received multiple shrapnel wounds. President Zelenskiy has held a joint news conference with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin today. He said that Kyiv and its western supporters could make Russia’s defeat in the war in Ukraine “irreversible” this year. He also thanked Germany for its military support and said his country would always be grateful to Germany for its support during Russia’s full-scale invasion. He said: Now is the time for us to determine the end of the war already this year, we can make the aggressor’s defeat irreversible already this year. Ukraine is expected to launch spring counteroffensive operations imminently to try to recapture swathes of its east and south territories from Russian forces. Zelenskiy stressed that while Kyiv would discuss peace initiatives from other states, any proposals had to be based on Ukraine’s position and its peace plan. He said: The war is happening on the territory of our country and so any peace plan will be based on Ukraine’s proposals. Kyiv has previously said it wants to regain every part of its land currently occupied by Russian forces and it will not be willing to make territorial concessions. Moscow says it controls the Crimean peninsula and four other Ukraine regions: Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk. You can read our report about Putin’s annexing of those regions in September last year here: President Zelenskiy has tweeted his thanks to Germany “for the largest military aid package since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion”. He stated, in German first and then in English: German air defense systems, artillery, tanks and infantry fighting vehicles are saving Ukrainian lives and bringing us closer to victory. Germany is a reliable ally! Together we are bringing peace closer! Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine, has posted a short video on Twitter of the security measures in force today in Germany for president Zelenskiy’s visit. The Washington Post yesterday reported that in private meetings with top military aides, president Zelenskiy had plotted attacks inside Russia, according to leaks from communications intercepted by US spies. The Post’s diplomacy and national security correspondent John Hudson said Zelenskiy had discussed occupying Russian villages to gain leverage over Moscow, bombing a pipeline that transfers Russian oil to Hungary, a Nato member, and privately pining for long-range missiles to hit targets inside Russia’s borders, per leaked documents. You can read the story here. Zelenskiy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak has also tweeted that he has been speaking to the US President Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, today. He said the pair had discussed the current state of the war and “ensuring unity and support” at the meeting of the G7, which will take place in the middle of May in the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Yermak also stated that Russia’s econony had to be “destroyed” with sanctions to “make them pay for their crimes”. The Kyiv Independent is reporting that an unexploded device left behind by the Russian army has killed five people, after it exploded in Myroliubivka, a village in Kherson Oblast today. Those killed were between 27 and 68, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said. The home town of Ukraine’s Eurovision contestants Tvorchi has been attacked a second time, the Ukraine State Emergency Service has said. Two people were injured by missile strikes on the Ternopil sparking fires which burned until 2.30am. The SES has said more explosions damaged civilian buildings and cars at 5am. “There is currently no information about the victims,” it wrote on Telegram. After the first attack, the electro-pop duo said: Ternopil is the name of our hometown, which was bombed by Russia while we sang on the Eurovision stage about our steel hearts, indomitability and will. This is a message for all cities of Ukraine that are shelled every day. Kharkiv, Dnipro, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Uman, Sumy, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Kherson and all others. Europe, unite against evil for the sake of peace. Glory to Ukraine. The UK Ministry of Defence has posted an update on the situation in Ukraine. It states that while Russian forces retain the same organisational structure to when it invaded Ukraine last February, it is, in fact, a very different military force. It states that in February 2022 “it consisted of professional soldiers; was largely equipped with reasonably modern vehicles; and had been regularly exercised, aspiring to complex, joint operations\".” Now, however, it says “the force is mostly poorly trained mobilised reservists and increasingly reliant on antiquated equipment, with many of its units severely under-strength. It routinely only conducts very simple, infantry-based operations.” Today is Mother’s Day in Ukraine: Even as Russia attacked Kyiv again last night, young people partied and supported the country’s Eurovision entry. David Pratt, Contributing Foreign Editor at the Herald in Scotland Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked Germany for its support as he met with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Sunday in his first visit to the country since Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy flew on a German government plane escorted over German airspace by fighter jets of the Luftwaffe air force, arriving in the middle of the night. Reuters reports that Zelenskiy wrote in the guest book of the German presidency: In the most challenging time in the modern history of Ukraine, Germany proud to be our true friend and reliable ally. Together we will win and bring peace back to Europe. From Reuters: Zelenskiy is expected to meet later with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his security cabinet before heading to Aachen in west Germany to receive the prestigious Charlemagne prize in honour of services to Europe. Germany, which is Europe’s largest economy, faced criticism at the start of the war for what some called a hesitant response, but it has become one of Ukraine’s biggest providers of financial and military assistance. On Saturday the German government announced 2.7 billion euro ($3 billion) of military aid to Ukraine, its biggest package since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. The country’s leaders pledged to support Kyiv for as long as is necessary. Zelenskiy hailed this as a “powerful package” in a tweet, indicating that he aimed to discuss weapons supply as well as air defence, reconstruction, Ukraine’s candidacy for membership of the European Union and security with German officials. Zelenskiy last visited Germany for the Munich Security Council in February last year just before the war broke out. Germany was constrained in its support for Ukraine at that time both by its energy dependence on Russia and a pacifism rooted in its bloody 20th century history. This required a major policy upheaval and a shift in mindset that Scholz dubbed a “Zeitenwende” or turn of era, in a landmark speech just days after the war broke out. (Reporting by Andreas Rinke and Sarah Marsh Editing by David Goodman and Frances Kerry) Here are some of the latest images coming out of Ukraine: The G7 and European Union will ban Russian gas imports on routes where Moscow cut supplies off last year, according to the Financial Times. The decision, to be finalised by G7 leaders at a summit in Hiroshima starting on Friday, will prevent the resumption of Russian pipeline gas exports on routes to countries such as Poland and Germany. The home town of Ukraine’s Eurovision entry came under fire from Russian missiles during the song contest on Saturday. Ternopil, the university home town of electronic music duo Tvorchi, was among the places targeted, with local authorities confirming two people had been injured. The band was performing on stage as air raid sirens rang out across Ternopil and later posted a message of solidarity to their Instagram: “Europe, unite against evil for the sake of peace! GLORY TO UKRAINE!” For more on this story: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy landed in Berlin overnight as he seeks to shore up support from key allies. “Already in Berlin,” Zelenskiy tweeted shortly after midnight on Sunday, arriving from Italy where he met with Italian officials and Pope Francis. The trip comes after the German government announced a new military package worth €2.7bn as Ukrainian forces prepare for a counter-offensive to reclaim territory captured by Russia. According to local media reports, Zelenskiy is expected to meet in the morning with German chancellor Olaf Scholz and president Frank-Walter Steinmeier. He may also head to the western German city of Aachen, which is awarding him and the Ukrainian people the Charlemagne prize – an honour awarded for efforts to foster European unity. Welcome back to our continuing coverage the war in Ukraine, I’m Yang Tian bringing you the latest. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has landed in Berlin, according to a post on his Twitter feed. “Already in Berlin,” Zelenskiy tweeted shortly after midnight on Sunday after the German government announced a further €2.7bn of military aid to Ukraine, its biggest such package since the Russian invasion. Russian missiles struck the home town of Ukraine’s Eurovision entry Tvorchi during the song contest. Authorities in Ternopil said the strike had hit warehouses and injured two people. More details coming shortly. In other key developments: The Russian news outlet Kommersant reported that two Russian fighter jets and two military helicopters had been shot down on Saturday close to the Ukrainian border. Kommersant said on its website that the Su-34 fighter-bomber, Su-35 fighter and two Mi-8 helicopters had made up a raiding party, and had been “shot down almost simultaneously” in an ambush in the Bryansk region, adjoining north-east Ukraine. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will push other global leaders to pledge more support for Ukraine when he attends international summits next week, according to his office. Sunak will travel to Iceland on Tuesday to meet other European leaders attending a Council of Europe summit. South Africa’s presidential security adviser said the country was “actively non-aligned” in Russia’s war against Ukraine, after US allegations it had supplied weapons to Moscow led to a diplomatic crisis. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had spoken to the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and urged him to help implement Kyiv’s peace plan to end the war. Ukrainian forces have regained at least a kilometre of territory in Bakhmut amid a Russian withdrawal that reflects Moscow’s “severe shortage of credible combat units”, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in an intelligence briefing. It said elements of a Russian brigade withdrew “in bad order” from their positions on the southern flank of the eastern Ukrainian city, the scene of the war’s longest battle. Japan has expressed concern about Russian and Chinese military cooperation in Asia and believes the two countries are strengthening their joint exercises. Foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said the security situation in Europe and the Indo-Pacific region was indivisible since the war in Ukraine started and that Russia’s invasion had “shaken the very foundation of the international order”. Russian attacks injured three people in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, the city’s mayor said. The strikes occurred early on Saturday, Oleksandr Sienkevych said on his Telegram channel. Russian forces targeted a factory, also damaging nearby residential buildings, causing fires in three apartments and damaging an educational institution, he said. A 15-year-old girl was among two people killed while 10 more were injured in a Russian shelling attack, Ukraine’s defence ministry said. The eastern city of Kostyantynivka was targeted by Smerch rocket launchers. Russian-installed officials in Luhansk have said missiles fired by Ukrainian forces injured six children and a Russian parliamentarian and damaged two disused factories in the eastern Ukrainian region’s main city, about 100km (60 miles) behind the frontlines. An unidentified object that entered Polish airspace from the direction of Belarus was probably an observation balloon, Poland’s defence ministry said on Saturday. A spokesperson for Poland’s territorial defence force said a search for the object was under way. Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit after a suspected attack on the Kremlin last week. The unit was launched on Tuesday during the annual second world war Victory Day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have said. Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident from shelling at the Russian-occupied nuclear power station, Europe’s biggest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/24/russia-strikes-are-against-humanity-zelenskiy-tells-un-as-power-cut-in-ukraine-and-moldova","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-24T01:20:22Z","webTitle":"Russia strikes are crime against humanity, Zelenskiy tells UN, as power cut in Ukraine and Moldova","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/24/russia-strikes-are-against-humanity-zelenskiy-tells-un-as-power-cut-in-ukraine-and-moldova","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/24/russia-strikes-are-against-humanity-zelenskiy-tells-un-as-power-cut-in-ukraine-and-moldova","fields":{"headline":"Russia strikes are crime against humanity, Zelenskiy tells UN, as power cut in Ukraine and Moldova","bodyText":"Fresh Russian strikes battered Ukraine’s already failing electricity grid, causing blackouts across the country and in neighbouring Moldova, in attacks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the UN were “an obvious crime against humanity”. Addressing an urgent meeting of the UN security council late on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Ukraine would put forward a resolution condemning “any forms of energy terror”. Referring to Russia’s likely veto, he said, “it’s nonsense that the veto right is secured for the party that wages this war.” “We cannot be hostage to one international terrorist,” Zelenskiy said. He also invited the UN to send experts to examine and evaluate Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. “When we have the temperature below zero, and scores of millions of people without energy supplies, without heating, without water, this is an obvious crime against humanity,” Zelenskiy told the security council via video link. It comes as talks between the G7 and other pro-Ukraine allies to set a cap on the price of Russian oil reportedly hit a set-back, after a meeting between EU officials ended without agreement. The price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil will form part of sanctions intended to punish Moscow by limiting its revenues from oil exports. EU diplomats were reportedly unable to reach an agreement on what price the cap should be set at. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. The country’s Energy Ministry said supplies were cut to “the vast majority of electricity consumers”. All of Kyiv lost water, the capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. The city’s administration said water and heating would return to residential buildings on Thursday morning. Late Wednesday, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office said that Kyiv and over a dozen regions, including Lviv and Odesa in the south, had been reconnected to the power grid. Klitschko said 21 out of 31 missiles targeting Kyiv were shot down before they reached their targets. One of the 10 that evaded the defences hit an apartment block in Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of the city, killing three people and wounding 15. There was a kindergarten in the lower ground floor of the building, but it was evacuated after air raid sirens went off. The blast left a three-metre crater in front of the building, destroyed apartments around it, blew the tops of nearby trees and ruined a children’s playground. “It flew right over us. We heard a whistling sound and then it came down on the building,” said Ruslan Vorona, a local resident. He and his eight-year-old son, Oleksii, were sheltering and charging their phones in a tent set up by the emergency services. Another local man, Oleksandr, 28, who would not give his last name, said: “There were a few explosions. Two were quieter and one was louder, and one of the missiles went straight over my head.” Earlier in the day, a newborn baby was killed when a Russian rocket struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s state emergency service said a woman with her two-day-old baby and a doctor were in the facility in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, when it was hit. The mother and the doctor were pulled alive from the rubble by rescue workers but the baby died, it said on the Telegram messaging app. UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo demanded at the security council meeting that Russia immediately stop the attacks, which violate international humanitarian law, stressing “there must be accountability for any violations of the laws of war.” US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Vladimir Putin was “weaponising winter to inflict intense suffering on the Ukraine people”. Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told the security council that Moscow was carrying out “strikes against infrastructure in response to the unbridled flow of weapons to Ukraine and the reckless appeals of Kyiv to defeat Russia”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the latest series of Russian strikes were a response to a decision by the European parliament to recognise Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism” over its nine-month invasion of Ukraine, and its call for the 27-nation EU to follow. “Being unable to win in a fair fight with the Ukrainian army, Russia wages a cowardly war of terror against civilians,” Kuleba said, urging Kyiv’s western backers to supply more air defence systems. Wednesday’s decision by European legislators to recognise Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism” is a symbolic political step with no legal consequences. Kyiv has for months called on the international community to declare Russia a “terrorist state,” and the EU parliament’s decision will probably anger Moscow. The resolution approved by EU lawmakers said the “deliberate attacks and atrocities carried out by the Russian Federation against the civilian population of Ukraine … and other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law amount to acts of terror.” Ukraine praised the decision, with Zelenskiy calling for Russia to be “held accountable in order to end its longstanding policy of terrorism in Ukraine and across the globe.” Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/19/the-guardian-view-on-war-in-ukraine-fighting-on-multiple-fronts","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T17:30:16Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on war in Ukraine: fighting on multiple fronts | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/the-guardian-view-on-war-in-ukraine-fighting-on-multiple-fronts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/the-guardian-view-on-war-in-ukraine-fighting-on-multiple-fronts","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on war in Ukraine: fighting on multiple fronts ","bodyText":"A spate of explosions in Crimea has bolstered the mood in Ukraine. While Kyiv has been coy in discussing the incidents publicly, dropping heavy hints but not explicitly taking credit, unnamed officials have been busy briefing reporters. On 9 August, nine or more Russian warplanes appear to have been destroyed at the Saky airbase on the peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. Then, on Tuesday, blasts were reported at an ammunition site and airfield. Russia blamed “sabotage”. On Thursday night, there were reports of more explosions at the major Belbek airbase, as well as a blaze at a munitions depot inside Russia. All these are a much-needed fillip for Ukrainian morale. A senior presidential adviser has said that there is “strategic deadlock”. Though the picture in the country’s south is muddled, Russian forces appear largely stalled. But Ukraine is massively outgunned and Russia continues to gain ground in the east, albeit slowly and with serious losses, by pounding away with heavy artillery and no regard for the cost to Ukrainian civilians or its own forces. Events in Crimea are a long way from turning the tide. Officials in Ukraine say that they hope hitting deep into occupied territory will cut supply routes and erode Russian capabilities. The defence minister has said that it will ultimately launch a full-scale counter-offensive, when it has the weapons and ammunition that it needs from its partners. In other words, its more nimble approach is a matter of necessity as well as ability. Additionally, wars are only partially fought on the battlefield. Kyiv also needs to kindle renewed purpose at home and maintain national unity as the relief and pride at holding off the initial Russian onslaught inevitably fades, and grinding economic, social and psychological pressures take their toll. It needs to rattle the confidence of Moscow – which this week replaced the commander of its Black Sea fleet – and lower the morale of Russian forces. Russia felt safe in Crimea, with its tourists sunning themselves on the beaches. Now they have been filmed fleeing the sands, with plumes of black smoke visible in the distance. Finally, Kyiv needs a sense of fresh momentum to maintain support elsewhere. The story of a plucky, courageous underdog staving off a vicious invasion was enough to create a wave of public and political support across Europe this spring. As fuel prices keep rising and winter approaches, sympathy and solidarity will ebb, and politicians are likely to become correspondingly warier of extending their support to Ukraine and punishment of Russia. It has also been clear from the beginning of the conflict that a less confident Vladimir Putin may be more dangerous. On Thursday, Moscow snubbed the call from the UN secretary general, António Guterres, visiting Ukraine, for a withdrawal of military equipment and personnel from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest. Russia seized the plant this spring and the two countries have accused each other of shelling the site. Ukraine has warned that Russia may plan to stage a “provocation” there or to stop generating electricity – which could increase the risk of an accident. Mr Putin knows that the weaponisation of a nuclear plant would be crossing a new frontier. But brinkmanship is itself a danger, bearing the risks of unintended disaster. Whatever confidence Kyiv has gained from the damage in Crimea, it will not mistake events this week as offering respite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2021/apr/23/children-of-chernobyl-parents-have-no-higher-number-of-dna-mutations","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-23T15:56:59Z","webTitle":"Children of Chernobyl parents have no higher number of DNA mutations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/23/children-of-chernobyl-parents-have-no-higher-number-of-dna-mutations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2021/apr/23/children-of-chernobyl-parents-have-no-higher-number-of-dna-mutations","fields":{"headline":"Children of Chernobyl parents have no higher number of DNA mutations","bodyText":"For decades popular culture has portrayed babies born to the survivors of nuclear accidents as mutants with additional heads or at high risk of cancers. But now a study of children whose parents were exposed to radiation from the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 suggests they carry no more DNA mutations than children born to any other parents. The study, published in Science, is one of the first to systematically evaluate alterations in human mutation rates in response to a manmade disaster, such as accidental radiation exposure. As well as providing fresh insights into how radiation affects the human body, the findings should help reassure other people who may have been exposed to radiation, such as those living near the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan in 2011, that it is safe to return home or have children. “There’s a lot of reticence among people to go back, and one of the major concerns is the transgenerational effects,” said Dr Stephen Chanock, of the National Cancer Institute in Rockville, Maryland, who supervised the research. “There’s this science-fiction societal view of three-headed babies, which is really accentuated in the Fukushima setting right now.” Although ionising radiation can damage DNA in the cells of people exposed to it, potentially their risk of cancer, it was less clear whether egg and sperm cells were similarly affected. In theory, mutations in these cells could be transmitted down the generations, potentially triggering developmental disorders or cancers in the descendents of radiation-exposed individuals. To investigate this possibility, Chanock and his colleagues analysed the genomes of 130 children born to parents who were either involved in the cleanup of the Chernobyl site after the accident, or were evacuated from nearby towns and settlements, as well the parents’ genomes. All of the children were conceived after the accident. Even though their parents had been exposed to high levels of radiation, there was no increase in the number of new mutations – those not detected in either parent but that could have arisen because of damage to their eggs or sperm – in these children. “These mutations may be in the parents’ blood, but we’re not seeing this horrific science-fiction-like mutation of sperm and eggs,” said Chanock. “I think this should be reassuring data that there’s a lack of evidence for substantial or significant transgenerational effects.” Dr Alex Cagan, a postdoctoral fellow at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Hinxton, England, said: “While these findings do not diminish the innumerable personal tragedies associated with the Chernobyl nuclear accident they do provide a glimmer of hope that the potentially damaging effects to DNA do not appear to have been passed down to the children of those involved.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-dozens-of-towns-recaptured-in-east-and-south-says-zelenskiy","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-05T17:18:49Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Putin changes mobilisation rules as Kremlin defends retreat from occupied regions – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-dozens-of-towns-recaptured-in-east-and-south-says-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-dozens-of-towns-recaptured-in-east-and-south-says-zelenskiy","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Putin changes mobilisation rules as Kremlin defends retreat from occupied regions – as it happened","bodyText":"The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has signed the four laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four areas, and it remains unclear where Russia is attempting to set its new external border. Ukraine has made major and rapid advances this week, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying in an address on Tuesday night that “dozens” of towns had been recaptured. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, and in the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. Pro-Russian leaders in the occupied regions have claimed that the situation is stabilising this morning. Denis Pushilin, installed as governor in Donetsk by Russia, has said “the situation on the front line in the Lyman direction is stabilising, the defence line is being strengthened”, while Kirill Stremousov, part of the occupation administration imposed on Kherson, has been quoted saying that Russian forces were “conducting a regrouping in order to gather their strength and deliver a retaliatory blow” in the region, and that “the advance of the armed forces of Ukraine in the Kherson direction has stopped”. None of the claims could be independently verified. Asked about the proposed borders, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: “In general, of course, there we are talking about the territory in which the military-civilian administration operated at the time of admission [to Russia]. But I repeat once again: certain territories there will be returned, and we will continue to consult with the population that expresses a desire to live with Russia.” The UK ministry of defence has said in its daily operational briefing that “Ukraine continues to make progress in offensive operations along both the north-eastern and southern fronts. In the north-east, in Kharkiv oblast, Ukraine has now consolidated a substantial area of territory east of the Oskil River.” Putin said in televised comments that he had signed a decree making “corrections” to the partial mobilisation drive he announced 21 September. The Russian president said the decree would defer conscription for additional categories of students, including those enrolled at accredited private universities and certain postgraduate students. The EU has agreed to set a price cap on Russian oil and ban trade in numerous technical and consumer goods, as part of further sanctions designed to counter Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. The latest round of sanctions, the eighth since February, were signed off by EU ambassadors on Wednesday, a week after the measures were proposed, a timescale regarded as lightning speed in Brussels. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) would operate under the supervision of Russian agencies after the annexation declaration. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the earliest days of the war. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-enterprise that owns the plant, has said it may restart it to ensure safety. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, said that overnight “the enemy fired rockets at the regional centre and the outskirts of the city. Infrastructure facilities were destroyed.” Zelenskiy has posted a series of images of damaged buildings across social media from recently liberated Lyman, with the message “Our Lyman after the occupier. All basics of life have been destroyed here. They are doing so everywhere in the territories they seize. This can be stopped in one way only: liberate Ukraine, life, humanity, law and truth as soon as possible.” The Russian TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, famous for staging an on-air protest against Russia’s war in Ukraine, confirmed she had escaped house arrest over further charges of spreading fake news, saying she had no case to answer. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, says Washington’s decision to send more military aid to Ukraine poses a threat to Moscow’s interests and increases the risk of a military clash between Russia and the west. Russia’s foreign ministry said that it had expelled a Lithuanian diplomat. The British prime minister, Liz Truss, has said that Ukraine “will win” and that no peace deal should give away Ukrainian territory. She said: “The Ukrainian people aren’t just fighting for their security but for all of our security. This is a fight for freedom and democracy around the world. We should not give in to those who want a deal which trades away Ukrainian land. They are proposing to pay in Ukrainian lives for the illusion of peace. We will stand with our Ukrainian friends, however long it takes. Ukraine can win. Ukraine must win. And Ukraine will win.” The latest report from Guardian correspondents in Kyiv and Kryvyi Rih. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to concede the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals in Ukraine, insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. Russia has suffered significant losses in two of the four regions since Friday, when Putin signed treaties to incorporate them into Russia by force, with Russian officials saying their forces were “regrouping”. With Ukraine pushing its advance in the east and south, Russian troops have been retreating under pressure on both fronts, confronted by fast moving and agile Ukrainian forces supplied with advanced western-supplied artillery systems. Read in full here: Ukrainian staff running the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) are preparing to restart one of the plant’s six reactors, all of which are currently shut down, the UN nuclear watchdog has said. “Senior Ukrainian operating staff informed IAEA experts present at the ZNPP that preparations are under way to start unit 5 at reduced power to produce steam and heat for the needs of the plant,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement, adding that preparations would take “some time”. President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Wednesday ordering the Russian government to take control of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and make it “federal property”, Reuters reported. The plant, the biggest in Europe, is controlled by Russian troops but has been operated until now by Ukrainian staff. Its proximity to the frontline of fighting has raised international fears of a nuclear disaster. The electricity supply to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine is fragile, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog has said. “The situation with regards to external power continues to be extremely precarious. We do have at the moment external power, but it is, I would say, fragile. There is one line feeding the plant,” said Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, via telephone link from Ukraine. Addressing the Energy Intelligence Forum in London on Wednesday, he added that his itinerary would also take him to Russia for talks. Russia’s foreign ministry said today that it had expelled a Lithuanian diplomat in a retaliatory move. Reuters reports that in a statement posted on its website, the ministry said that it “reserves the right to take additional measures” in response to what it called Lithuania’s “unfriendly steps”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said in televised comments that he signed a decree making “corrections” to the partial mobilisation drive he announced 21 September. Reuters reports that speaking at a meeting with teachers, which was broadcast on state television to mark World Teachers’ Day, Putin said the decree would defer conscription for additional categories of students, including those enrolled at accredited private universities and certain postgraduate students. Reuters has a quick snap that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said at a televised meeting with teachers today that Russia had “great respect” for the Ukrainian people, despite what he called “the current situation”. Referring to the four partly Russian-controlled Ukrainian regions that he declared Russian territory on Friday, Putin said he expected the situation there to “stabilise”. The former spokesperson to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and one of his erstwhile closest confidantes who was present during his only encounter with Vladimir Putin in 2019, has published a book in which she recalls her time working at Zelenskiy’s side, and does not shy away from criticising him. In The Fight of Our Lives: My Time With Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s Battle for Democracy and What It Means for the World, due for print publication in the UK on 27 October, Iuliia Mendel details her former boss’s improbable rise from comedian to president, focusing on the two years she worked with him until the summer 2021. In an interview with the newspaper Bild, to coincide with the German publication of her book, Mendel said that no one in Ukraine had been prepared for war, not even Zelenskiy. But she says she believes Zelenskiy should have acted sooner on intelligence information that an invasion of Ukraine was imminent. “There is of course criticism in Ukraine. People say: ‘If he knew, he should have told people so that they could have been brought to safety.’ I would say it was very unfair not to tell people anything. There is a lot of injustice contained in this behaviour. But if you ask me what I would have done as a leader, then I really don’t know.” Mendel said that much of what Zelenskiy has done since the invasion has been “very natural and intuitive. Very logical and correct.” “I have often been asked about the transition of his image, from the suit to the T-shirt, and whether there were stylists behind the scenes,” she said. But Zelenskiy she insists “made all the decisions himself” and there was “no place for stylists” in the air-raid bunker in which he lived with his core team for weeks on end. Kirill Stremousov, who is one of the leaders in the Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Kherson, has suggested on Telegram that Ukrainian forces have been suffering casualties during their attempt to push down into Kherson. He posted: The big game in the Kherson region continues. For many Ukronazis, this game has already ended on the outskirts. All who come with weapons to the territory of the Kherson region of the Russian Federation will be destroyed. The EU has agreed to set a price cap on Russian oil and ban trade in numerous technical and consumer goods, as part of further sanctions designed to counter Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. The latest round of sanctions, the eighth since February, were signed off by EU ambassadors on Wednesday, a week since the measures were proposed, a time scale regarded as lightning speed in Brussels. EU diplomats confirmed that the bloc had agreed to cap the price of Russian oil, after providing “assurances” to Greece, Cyprus and Malta, countries with large shipping industries. Prior to the agreement, these countries argued the oil price cap should not be imposed by the EU without guarantees that other non-EU countries, such as India, would also sign up to a price cap. The EU oil price cap follows a pledge by the G7 earlier this month. Under plans agreed by the US, Canada, Japan, the UK, France, Germany and Italy, firms shipping and insuring Russian oil will only be able to operate if they adhere to a price below a yet-to-be-determined level. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, welcomed the agreement, saying the EU had moved quickly and decisively. EU officials will be relieved to have secured agreement before two days of summitry in Prague, partly intended as a show of solidarity with Ukraine. Leaders from 44 countries across Europe will meet on Thursday in the Czech capital to discuss security on the continent, followed by an EU summit on Friday where the bloc’s leaders will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Garry Kasparov, the former chess world champion and anti-Putin regime campaigner, has given an interview to the German news magazine Spiegel in which he says that “every Russian who is living in Russia now is part of the war machine” and demands that those who want to stand on the right side of history should leave. Kasparov tells the magazine that he has spent 20 years fighting against Vladimir Putin. “I always said that his regime would unavoidably become a fascist threat – not only for Russia, not only for its neighbours, but for the entire world. It would have been nice if a few more people would have taken this warning to heart.” Asked by Spiegel if being abroad – he has lived in political exile since 2013 – he wasn’t in too comfortable a position to be making such demands of those who have yet to leave Russia, he said: “This is war. Either you’re on one side of the front or the other. Every Russian citizen, including me, carries collective responsibility for this war, even if not a personal responsibility. Today Russia is a fascistic dictatorship, which, while we’re speaking here, is carrying out crimes against humanity. And everyone who is still living in Russia now, is a part of this war machinery, whether he wants to be or not.” Kasparov said Russians who want to be given asylum elsewhere should first have to sign a three-point declaration in which they would “declare the war to be criminal, the Putin regime illegitimate and Ukraine indivisible”, Kasparov said. By signing it, the individual would be liable for prosecution in Russia on three counts according to laws Putin has put in place, he added. The 59-year old chess grandmaster makes the interesting claim that Putin “never played chess, but poker, and he was good at geopolitical poker. He often played with bad cards and won, because his opponents fell for his bluff.” The Financial Times is quoting Ihor Romanenko, a former deputy head of Ukraine’s general staff, on how vital it is that Ukrainian forces are able to make swift progress during this phase of their counter-offensive. The newspaper reports he said: Certainly it is crucial to advance swiftly in liberating occupied territory because there is a sense that changes in the weather will limit further active military actions in this region. If our allies were to help us by providing more of the modern weaponry we are asking for, then the situation would be much swifter and we would not be talking about the factor of weather. Russian news agency RIA is carrying quotes from the deputy foreign minister of Russia Sergei Vershinin confirming that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director general Rafael Grossi will be visiting Moscow. It quotes Vershinin saying: I confirm reports that Grossi is going to come to Kyiv, and then to Moscow. In terms of time, these will be the next few days. Vershinin went on to say: Grossi put forward a number of ideas that are now being discussed with experts. The task is nuclear safety and the exclusion of shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is carried out by the Ukrainian side, and the normal functioning of the nuclear power plant. The IAEA has previously called for a nuclear safety exclusion zone around the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March. Until now it has continued to be operated by staff employed by Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-enterprise which manages the plant. However, the plant sits on land that has now been claimed to be annexed by Russia, and Vershinin said: “The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is now on the territory of the Russian Federation and, accordingly, should be operated under the supervision of our relevant agencies.” Both Russian and Ukraine have accused the other side of shelling the plant and risking a nuclear accident. Reuters is reporting some diplomatic tension between Russia and Kazakhstan over the Ukraine war with Kazakh authorities rejecting a demand from Russia that they expel Ukraine’s ambassador over comments about killing Russians, chiding Moscow for what they called an inappropriate tone between “equal strategic partners”. Ukraine’s ambassador in Astana, Petro Vrublevskiy, said in August in an interview with a local blogger that “the more Russians we kill now, the fewer of them our children will have to kill”. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Tuesday said Moscow was “outraged” by the fact that Vrublevskiy was still in Astana and had summoned the Kazakh ambassador. Kazakh foreign ministry spokesman Aibek Smadiyarov on Wednesday called Zakharova’s tone “discordant with the nature of the allied relations between Kazakhstan and Russia as equal strategic partners”, adding that the Russian ambassador would in turn be summoned to the Kazakh ministry. The British Prime Minister Liz Truss has said that Ukraine “will win” and that no peace deal should give away Ukrainian territory while addressing the annual conference of the UK’s ruling Conservative party in Birmingham. She said: The Ukrainian people aren’t just fighting for their security but for all of our security. This is a fight for freedom and democracy around the world. Putin’s illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory is just the latest act in his campaign to subvert democracy and violate international law. We should not give in to those who want a deal which trades away Ukrainian land. They are proposing to pay in Ukrainian lives for the illusion of peace. We will stand with our Ukrainian friends, however long it takes. Ukraine can win. Ukraine must win. And Ukraine will win. She received one of the warmest rounds of applause of her speech for the section on Ukraine and went on to say that she was sure that Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people would appreciate “our solidarity with them at this very difficult time”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was asked in his regular briefing about the borders of Russia’s claimed annexation. He said: Read the order. There is a legal wording there. In general, of course, there we are talking about the territory in which the military-civilian administration operated at the time of admission [to Russia]. But I repeat once again: certain territories there will be returned, and we will continue to consult with the population that expresses a desire to live with Russia. The state-owned Tass news agency reported earlier: New regions within Russia will retain the status of republics and regions and their former names. According to the documents, the boundaries of the regions will be determined by their borders, which “existed on the day of their formation and acceptance into the Russian Federation”. The territory of the DPR and LPR is defined by the 2014 borders established in their constitutions. Zaporizhzhia is part of the Russian Federation within its administrative boundaries, and Kherson region - with two districts of the Mykolaiv region, explained the head of the State Duma Committee on State Building and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov. The Kremlin said this morning that there was no contradiction between incorporating Ukrainian territories into the Russian Federation and military retreats, saying that Moscow would press ahead with its plans to annex four Ukrainian regions. “They will be with Russia forever and they will be returned,” Reuters reports Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the media. President Vladimir Putin formalised the annexation of the four Ukrainian regions – around 18% of Ukraine’s territory – this morning despite a series of major battlefield reversals in recent days shrinking the amount of seized territory Moscow can say it actually controls. Russian forces lost a vast numbers of tanks during the first few months of the war, prompting questions over whether they were becoming obsolete. But the tank has previously appeared to have been consigned to the ash heap of history only to rise again to reaffirm its relevance. Josh Toussaint-Strauss examines for the Guardian Russia’s early deployment during the invasion and asks: if tanks aren’t the problem, why did they fail in Ukraine? Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed the four laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four areas, and it remains unclear where Russia is attempting to set its new external border. Ukraine has made major and rapid advances this week, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying in an address on Tuesday night that “dozens” of towns have been recaptured. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, and in the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. Pro-Russian leaders in the occupied regions have claimed that the situation is stabilising this morning. Denis Pushilin, installed as governor in Donetsk by Russia has said “the situation on the front line in the Lyman direction is stabilising, the defence line is being strengthened”, while Kirill Stremousov, part of the occupation administration imposed on Kherson, has been quoted saying that Russian forces were “conducting a regrouping in order to gather their strength and deliver a retaliatory blow” in the region, and “the advance of the armed forces of Ukraine in the Kherson direction has stopped”. The UK ministry of defence has said in its daily operational briefing that “Ukraine continues to make progress in offensive operations along both the north-eastern and southern fronts. In the north-east, in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine has now consolidated a substantial area of territory east of the Oskil River.” Russia’s foreign ministry has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) will operate under the supervision of Russian agencies after the annexation declaration. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the earliest days of the war. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-enterprise that owns the plant, has said it may restart it to ensure safety. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, said that overnight “the enemy fired rockets at the regional centre and the outskirts of the city. Infrastructure facilities were destroyed.” Zelenskiy has posted a series of images of damaged buildings across social media from recently liberated Lyman, with the message: “Our Lyman after the occupier. All basics of life have been destroyed here. They are doing so everywhere in the territories they seize.

This is Martin Belam in London, and I will be with you for the next few hours. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com The BBC’s Orla Guerin earlier published some pictures from her recent visit to areas that have been liberated from Russian occupation, saying: “The Russians are gone but there is damage that can never be undone, and the dead cannot be restored to life.” There are another couple of quotes on Telegram from sources within the Russian-occupied Donetsk region from Denis Pushilin, who is Russia’s acting governor in the territory it has claimed to annex there. He has said that “the situation on the frontline in the Lyman direction is stabilising, the defence line is being strengthened”, and that “we see that Ukrainian armed forces are now seriously supplemented by brigades that were trained in Nato countries, this must be taken into account”. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant will operate under the supervision of Russian agencies after Russia claimed to have formally annexed the wider Zaporizhzhia region, the RIA state-owned news agency reported. Reuters reports that another state-owned news agency, Tass, carried news that Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the earliest days of the war. Tass is also reporting that Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-imposed acting “governor” of Zaporizhzhia said that yesterday “there were about 40 strikes on the outskirts and the city of Enerhodar”, which houses the nuclear power plant. “Yesterday was pretty hot for us,” he added. Sir Andrew Wood, former British ambassador to Yugoslavia and Russia, and an associate fellow of the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House, was interviewed in the UK on Sky News earlier about the situation in Ukraine. He said he believed Vladimir Putin had made a “fatal error” with the partial mobilisation, which had bought the war closer to home, and was “chaotically ill-done”. He said he expected fighting to continue well into next year but raised doubts about whether Russia would escalate the conflict to a nuclear level. He said: Nobody in the west wants to get involved in a nuclear exchange. I don’t think anybody in the Russian Federation would want to be involved in a nuclear exchange, except possibly President Putin. The whole trouble with Russia is everything is being decided by one man who hides from discussion, who hides from other possible views, that interferes in military undertakings by issuing direct orders to the commanders on the field and has thoroughly muddled up the whole situation. Russian TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, famous for staging an on-air protest against Russia’s war in Ukraine, confirmed she had escaped house arrest over charges of spreading fake news again, saying she had no case to answer. “I consider myself completely innocent, and since our state refuses to comply with its own laws, I refuse to comply with the measure of restraint imposed on me as of 30 September 2022 and release myself from it,” Reuters reports she said on Telegram. Ovsyannikova, 44, was given two months’ house arrest in August over a protest in July when she stood on a river embankment opposite the Kremlin and held up a poster calling President Vladimir Putin a murderer and his soldiers fascists. She faced a sentence of up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of the charge of spreading fake news about Russia’s armed forces. If you missed it overnight, my colleague Peter Beaumont has been in the recently liberated city of Lyman, and sent this dispatch: Occupied until last week by soldiers of the Russian 20th Combined Arms army and Bars-13 troops from the Russian Guard – some of whom had earlier retreated from Kharkiv province – when the attack came they were quickly trapped in a rapidly closing encirclement as the villages outside the city, set among rolling hills, were rapidly rolled up. What is clear is that Ukraine’s military has found a way of fighting that is far more deft and flexible than the Russians – who are heavily reliant on their creaking supply lines – deploying quickly to cut off, encircle and destroy units piece by piece. And those Russians who stayed to fight were obliterated by shells and missile fire. Or shot in the forests. At a junction of a level crossing and a road, the trees around a Russian trench have been swept down as if by a giant hand, the road littered with artillery casings, bits of uniform and human remains. Surveying the scene, “Flagman”, a Ukrainian officer who has fought in this sector since Russia launched its invasion in February, said that while the Russians relied on the roads, the Ukrainians ambushed them from these woods. Read more of Peter Beaumont’s report from Lyman: ‘What was it all for?’: recaptured Lyman left shattered by Russian occupation Russia’s RIA Novosti has some further quotes from Vladimir Rogov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in occupied Zaporizhzhia. It quotes him saying: “The situation on the line of contact remains stably tense. The counter-battery fight continues.” Another of the Russian-imposed leaders in the regions the Russian Federation is claiming to annex in occupied Ukraine, Kirill Stremousov of Kherson, has been quoted saying that Russian forces were “conducting a regrouping in order to gather their strength and deliver a retaliatory blow” in the region. Denis Pushilin, another Russian-imposed leader, has also been reported by RIA as saying that Ukrainian forces are in the retreat in Bakhmut, “without the ability to hold its previously occupied positions”. None of the claims have been independently verified. Roland Oliphant, who is a senior foreign correspondent at the Telegraph , has suggested that much of what happens next in the war depends on whether the current Russian retreat is being carried out in good order back to sound defensive lines, which he says is how it is being described by some Russian sources, or whether it is a rout, as described by some Ukrainian voices. He suggests: It seems to me an awful lot depends on this, because the former may mean a winter stalemate and Russia staying in the war for the time being. The latter – a third disaster in a month and a snowball to general defeat that may be impossible to stop. However, he also cautions that “you may as well read a horoscope” as try to predict the outcome, saying: “I would advise you not to trust anyone who claims to know either way this morning. Everyone, with the exception of Ukrainian and Russian commands, is reading tea-leaves through the news blackout and Telegram.” Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, a region which today Russia has claimed to annex under Russian law, has issued a status update on Telegram. He says: The enemy fired rockets at the regional centre and the outskirts of the city. Infrastructure facilities were destroyed. Information about victims is being clarified. The anti-aircraft defence forces have worked. If you see unexploded munitions, don’t disturb it, do not come close, do not take pictures. Report the find to the rescuers. French junior minister for European affairs Laurence Boone has clarified the situation in which Russians fleeing the partial mobilisation for the war in Ukraine can obtain visas to stay in France. Reuters quotes her telling Franceinfo radio: “We have limited conditions under which visas can be given. We will make sure dissident journalists, people who fight the regime, artists and students can still come here, and we will issue visas on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the security risks.” Kirill Stremousov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in Ukraine’s Kherson region, has told the Russian Tass news agency that “the advance of the armed forces of Ukraine in the Kherson direction has stopped”. The claim has not been independently verified, and the news agency has provided no further details. It won’t come as a huge surprise to learn that Denis Pushilin, who had been acting as the self-declared leader of the chiefly unrecognised Donetsk People’s Republic, and who was in Moscow for Vladimir Putin’s annexation ceremony last week, has been immediately named as the Russian president’s choice to lead the Donetsk region as it is absorbed into the Russian Federation by Russian law. The Telegram channel of the Donetsk People’s Republic has published an image of the law. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed the four laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four areas. Russian state media Tass is reporting that the documents have been published now that Putin has signed them. It says: The boundaries of the new subjects of the Federation, as follows from the treaties, will be determined by the boundaries that “existed on the day of their formation and acceptance into the Russian Federation”. Until the election of the heads of the new regions, in accordance with Russian law, they will be led by temporary acting officials appointed by Putin. Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency is reporting the words of Vladimir Rogov, an official in the Russian-imposed administration in occupied Zaporizhzhia. He is claiming that Ukraine will stage a “provocation” at the Dnipro hydroelectric power station (DHP). It quotes him: Extremely unhealthy activity has been observed in relation to the DHP in the city of Zaporizhzhia, temporarily under the control of the Zelenskiy regime. The information we receive cannot but cause concern for the fate of our native land. The Kyiv authorities understand that Zaporizhzhia is both de facto and de jure already Russia, and the liberation of the rest of the Zaporizhzhia region is only a matter of time. So, while waiting for our offensive, according to their plan, the DHP can become the object of a provocation in order to blame Russia for everything. Rogov produced no evidence to back up his claims, but cited an exercise carried out in 2018 which simulated what would happen if the dam was breached, claiming that it would unleash “a 20-metre wave covering the coastal part of the city at a speed of over 60km per hour”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted a series of images across social media from recently liberated Lyman, with the message: Our Lyman after the occupier. All basics of life have been destroyed here. They are doing so everywhere in the territories they seize. This can be stopped in one way only: liberate Ukraine, life, humanity, law and truth as soon as possible. Vitaliy Kim, Ukraine’s governor of Mykolaiv, has posted his daily status update on Telegram, which lists Russian shelling across a number of settlements within his region. He says that nobody was injured overnight, but there was damage yesterday to infrastructure facilities in Voznesensk. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam in London taking over the live blog. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today – handing over to my colleague Martin Belam in London who will take you through the latest for the next while. The UK ministry of defence has published its daily intelligence update on the war, reporting that “Ukraine continues to make progress in offensive operations along both the north-eastern and southern fronts. In the north-east, in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine has now consolidated a substantial area of territory east of the Oskil River.” The other developments included in the report were: Ukrainian formations have advanced up to 20km beyond the river into Russia’s defensive zone towards the supply node of the town of Svatove. It is highly likely that Ukraine can now strike the key Svatove-Kremina road with most of its artillery systems, further straining Russia’s ability to resupply its units in the east. Politically, Russian leaders will highly likely be concerned that leading Ukrainian units are now approaching the borders of Luhansk Oblast, which Russia claimed to have formally annexed last Friday. There are major questions over the prospects of the “European Political Community” summit being launched in Prague on Thursday, AFP reports. The one-day gathering , the brainchild of French President Emmanuel Macron, will bring together the 27 European Union leaders with those from the broader neighbourhood, including Britain, Turkey and Ukraine. Brussels has billed the initiative as an invaluable “platform for political coordination” among the disparate grouping of 44 nations invited. But there are deep disagreements, among some of those attending and scepticism that the one-day event will turn out to be much more than a glorified photo opportunity. Russia was not invited and Zelenskiy will connect via video link from Kyiv. His prime minister will stand in for him at the talks. “The ambition is to bring leaders together on an equal footing and to foster political dialogue and cooperation on issues of common interest so that, together, we work on strengthening the security, stability and prosperity of Europe as a whole,” EU chief Charles Michel said in his invitation letter. As speculation mounts ahead of Friday’s Nobel peace prize announcement, observers suggest the committee may sound the alarm over the war in Ukraine, AFP reports. Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), suggested the Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, saying they deserved to win the prestigious honour together. “These are both champions of non-violent pro-democracy activities within their own countries,” he said. “And both Navalny and Tikhanovskaya have also been very strong opponents of the war in Ukraine”. Meanwhile, a price cap for Russian oil proposed as part of the European Union’s eighth round of sanctions against Russia will not apply to pipeline shipments, Hungary‘s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said in a statement late on Tuesday. Hungary, which has been the most vocal critic of sanctions against Russia in the EU, largely relies on Russian crude shipments and Russian gas, both imported via pipelines. Major oil producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia are set to meet today, as reports say they are mulling an output cut of up to 2m barrels per day in a bid to prop up slumping prices. If implemented, it will be the first such major cut since a landmark curb on production at the start of the Covid pandemic. Energy prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, pushing inflation to decades-high levels that have put pressure on economies across the world. But they have fallen in recent months on concerns over dwindling demand and a slowdown in the global economy. The 13 members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, and their 10 allies headed by Russia will hold their first in-person meeting since March 2020 at the group’s headquarters in Vienna. Here is the latest on nuclear concerns in the conflict: The United States has no indication that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict, despite “nuclear sabre-rattling” by Putin, according to the White House press secretary. An unnamed Western diplomat told Reuters that NATO has not warned alliance members of any Russian nuclear threat. And the Kremlin said it did not want to take part in “nuclear rhetoric” spread by the West after a British media report that Russia was preparing to demonstrate its willingness to use nuclear weapons in its conflict with Ukraine. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, says Washington’s decision to send more military aid to Ukraine poses a threat to Moscow’s interests and increases the risk of a military clash between Russia and the West. “We perceive this as an immediate threat to the strategic interests of our country,” Antonov said on the Telegram messaging app on Wednesday. “The supply of military products by the US and its allies not only entails protracted bloodshed and new casualties, but also increases the danger of a direct military clash between Russia and Western countries.” In case you missed this earlier, Ukraine may restart the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, to ensure its safety, the president of the company that operates the plant told the Associated Press on Tuesday. The potential restart comes weeks after there were escalating fears of a radiation disaster at the Russian-occupied facility. Energoatom, the Ukranian state nuclear company, shut down the plant’s six remaining reactors on 11 September amid fighting in the area. Russian military activity had cut off power supplies for safety systems, raising fears of a meltdown, the AP noted. But Energoatom president Petro Kotin told the AP today that the company may restart two of the reactors in the coming days to “protect safety installations as winter approaches and temperatures drop”. Kotin said: If you have low temperature, you will just freeze everything inside. The safety equipment will be damaged. So you need heating and the only heating is going to come from the working reactor.” Even with the reactors shut down, damage to the systems or failures due to cold weather could still lead to catastrophe, the company’s president said, adding, “You have residual heat and you should constantly provide the coolant for these fuel assemblies. If you stop cooling, then you will have meltdown. And that is how it works … We, at the moment, are evaluating all the risks. And this depends on the weather. And actually, we don’t have much time to do that.” Ukraine has made major and rapid advances this week, with Zelensky saying in an address on Tuesday that “dozens” of towns have been recaptured. Here is a roundup of what has happened on the battlefield, via Reuters: Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, according to the Russian-installed head of the administration of occupied areas in the province. Russian military bloggers described a Ukrainian tank advance through dozens of kilometres of territory along the west bank of the Dnipro. Kyiv has maintained almost complete silence about the situation in Kherson. In the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. The pro-Russian leader in Donetsk said forces were forming a new defensive line around the town of Kreminna. Russia has meanwhile sacked the commander of its Western military district, news outlet RBC reported. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the latest for the next few hours. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced on Tuesday that dozens of regions in Ukraine have been liberated from Russian occupation. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, according to the Russian-installed head of the administration of occupied areas in the province. In the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. The pro-Russian leader in Donetsk said forces were forming a new defensive line around the town of Kreminna. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments. Ukraine may restart the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, to ensure its safety, the president of the company that operates the plant told the Associated Press today. The potential restart comes weeks after there were escalating fears of a radiation disaster at the Russian-occupied facility. Ukraine’s economy will shrink at a rate eight times that of Russia’s this year as a result of the war triggered by Moscow’s invasion in February, the World Bank has estimated. Russia is at risk of losing control of the strategic towns critical to retaining the city of Kherson and eventually Crimea, western officials said, but they warned the fighting along the Dnieper river “will not be an easy rush into constrained territory”. The upper house of Russia’s parliament voted on Tuesday to approve the incorporation of four occupied Ukrainian regions into Russia, as Moscow sets about formally annexing territory it seized from Kyiv since staging its latest invasion of Ukraine in February. In a session on Tuesday, the Federation Council unanimously ratified legislation to annex the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, after a similar vote in the state Duma, Russia’s lower house. No lawmakers in the lower house voted against the bill either. Russia, however, no longer has full control of any of the four provinces it claims to have annexed, after Ukrainian troops reportedly advanced dozens of kilometres in Kherson province. The Russian military has acknowledged that Kyiv’s forces had broken through in the Kherson region. It said the Ukrainian army and its “superior tank units” had managed to “penetrate the depths of our defence” around the villages of Zoltaya Balka and Alexsandrovka. Zelenskiy has signed a decree declaring the prospect of any Ukrainian talks with Vladimir Putin “impossible”. The decree formalised comments made by Zelenskiy on Friday after the Russian president proclaimed the four occupied regions of Ukraine were to become part of Russia. Russia’s retreat from Lyman has sparked vociferous criticism of the handling of the war on Russian state television. Vladimir Solovyov, host of a primetime talkshow on state TV channel Russia 1 and one of the Kremlin’s biggest cheerleaders, said on air on Sunday: “We need to pull it together, make unpopular, but necessary decisions and act.” The Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) will restore its network to oppose the partial mobilisation aimed at bolstering Russia’s forces in Ukraine, close Navalny ally Ivan Zhdanov said in a video published on social media. Russian authorities have designated Alexei Navalny’s organisations “extremist” after months of increasing repression against his supporters, putting FBK employees, volunteers and sympathisers at risk of prosecution and imprisonment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/12/sunak-pledges-10bn-to-help-vulnerable-with-soaring-energy-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T07:40:52Z","webTitle":"Sunak pledges £10bn to help vulnerable with soaring energy bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/12/sunak-pledges-10bn-to-help-vulnerable-with-soaring-energy-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/12/sunak-pledges-10bn-to-help-vulnerable-with-soaring-energy-bills","fields":{"headline":"Sunak pledges £10bn to help vulnerable with soaring energy bills","bodyText":"Rishi Sunak has said he would find up to £10bn to help people facing rising energy bills, as a minister backing his Conservative leadership rival indicated that direct support for the hard-pressed would be announced “in a considered way”. Acknowledging he would have to increase government borrowing to tackle the crisis, the former chancellor sketched out what he envisaged would be a support package for up to 16 million vulnerable people. “People need reassurance now about what we will do and I make no apology for concentrating on what matters most,” Sunak wrote in the Times, which reported that he valued a cut to VAT on energy at £5bn. He was also said to have pledged to find the same amount again to go towards helping those most in need, as he said: “You can’t heat your home with hope.” It comes after Sunak claimed Liz Truss’s cost-of-living plans could put vulnerable people at risk of “real destitution”, with economic policy once again driving a wedge between the candidates. As Sunak and Truss took to the stage for the latest Tory party hustings in Cheltenham, Sunak refused to rule out “some limited and temporary one-off borrowing as a last resort to get us through this winter”. He also said that without further direct payments, pensioners and people on very low incomes could face serious hardship. However, the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, who is supporting Truss, hit back on Friday morning, taking a veiled swipe at Sunak for not waiting for the energy regulator Ofgem to make a key announcement about the energy price cap before his latest intervention. Defending Truss, Coffey said: “She is absolutely an MP who knowns what it is like for struggling households and that is why, quite rightly in a considered way, once Ofgem comes up with their price cap … all of government … and it will be decision for the new prime minister to enact what changes could be made.” Referring to Sunak, she said: “I appreciate what he is saying that but Ofgem has not reported. When he was chancellor he waited for Ofgem to report before coming up with some proposals.” Coffey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that she had delivered that previous support through legislation and at the time had been “blocked within government” when she asked for powers to make payments more quickly. “I have delivered that through legislation and at the time I asked for powers to be able to make payments more quickly. That was not given to me. That was blocked within government so if we are going to do things through the welfare system we would have to do brand new primary legislation,” she said. Sunak’s comments in Thursday’s hustings came after Truss, in her own Q&amp;A session at the event, reiterated her belief that tax cuts should be the main response to soaring bills. Truss told the audience of Tory members that this would always be her “first port of call”, followed by a focus on longer-term energy supply issues such as support for fracking and nuclear power. Truss said she could provide other assistance, but gave no details, saying she “can’t write the chancellor’s budget” before even being elected as prime minister. “If the answer to every question is raising tax, we will choke off economic growth, and we will send ourselves to penury, and I think that’s a massive problem,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/01/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-190-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T18:22:58Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 190 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-190-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-190-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 190 of the invasion","bodyText":"UN inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after being delayed for several hours by conflicting reports of shelling around Europe’s biggest atomic facility. Rafael Grossi, the chief international nuclear inspector, said he saw “the key things I needed to see” and his team was able to gather “a lot of information” during the long-awaited visit. “We have achieved something very important today and the important thing is the IAEA is staying here – let the world know that the IAEA is staying at Zaporizhzhia,” Grossi said in a video from Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency. The plant’s operator, Energoatom, said Grossi had left the site. Five IAEA representatives would remain, probably until Saturday. Grossi said his team would maintain a “continued presence”. Energoatom said early on Thursday that it had activated emergency procedures and shut down one of the facility’s two working reactors “as a result of another mortar shelling by Russian … forces at the site”. Ukrainian authorities are making “all efforts” to switch the plant’s fifth reactor back on, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear company said later. The Red Cross issued an urgent call for an end to all military operations around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, warning the consequences of a strike could be “catastrophic”. It was “high time to stop playing with fire and instead take concrete measures” to protect the plant from any military operations, director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Robert Mardini, said. The stakes were “immense”, he added. The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, accused Moscow of trying to wreck the inspection of the nuclear facility, saying Russia was acting like a terrorist state. “It is Russia that is responsible for everything happening at the plant,” he said. Russia claimed it repulsed an attempt by Ukrainian forces to sabotage or retake the plant. It said a small number of Ukrainian troops launched two amphibious attacks. It also alleged that Ukrainian fire came within 400 metres of the plant. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said: “We are doing everything to ensure that this station is safe, that it functions safely. And for the mission there to carry out all its plans.” Lavrov has warned Moldova that any actions seen as endangering the security of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transnistria would be considered an attack on Russia. Russia has had peacekeeping troops stationed in Transnistria since the early 1990s, when pro-Russia separatists wrested most of the region from Moldovan control. Ukraine’s counteroffensive to reclaim Kherson has not stalled or failed, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy has said. “It is carried out in a planned manner. We destroy enemy logistics, air defence systems, fuel and ammunition depots,” Oleksiy Arestovych said, adding: “There will be no quick wins.” Ukraine’s armed forces struck strategic bridges in the southern Kherson region to isolate Russian troops located on the right bank of the Dnieper, Arestovych said. Ukraine’s defence ministry said the Kakhovsky and Daryiv bridges, used by Russia to transport equipment and ammunition to the region, have been “disabled”. Thursday marked the return to school for many children in Ukraine, with face-to-face teaching resuming in some locations. Zelenskiy visited a school in Irpin that had been reconstructed after it was partially destroyed earlier in the year. Finland has said it will provide €8.3m in further defence aid to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin visited the open coffin of the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, on Thursday. The Russian president laid flowers at Moscow’s central clinical hospital, where Gorbachev died earlier this week aged 91. The Kremlin said Putin would not attend Gorbachev’s funeral this weekend because of schedule constraints. Russian forces have been forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians to Russia or areas of Ukraine under their control, according to Human Rights Watch. Forced transfers are “a serious violation of the laws of war that constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity”, HRW said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/oct/11/uk-to-designate-china-a-threat-in-hawkish-foreign-policy-shift","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-11T17:58:50Z","webTitle":"UK to designate China a ‘threat’ in hawkish foreign policy shift ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/11/uk-to-designate-china-a-threat-in-hawkish-foreign-policy-shift","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/oct/11/uk-to-designate-china-a-threat-in-hawkish-foreign-policy-shift","fields":{"headline":"UK to designate China a ‘threat’ in hawkish foreign policy shift ","bodyText":"China is to be formally designated a “threat” to Britain in a hasty rewrite of Boris Johnson’s defence and foreign policy that is being brought forward to end confusion among ministers about how to deal with Beijing. Under Johnson, China had been categorised as a “systemic competitor” but the new prime minister, Liz Truss, wants to take a more hawkish stance quickly, as she seeks to shore up support for her faltering premiership on her backbenches. The redesignation will bring the UK’s official position towards China close to its stance on Russia, currently classed as “the most acute threat” facing the UK. But it is almost certain to provoke a hostile reaction from Beijing. It had been intended to complete the policy rewrite at the end of the year, but sources said a special China strategy review was now being brought forward after the Department for Education was forced into a climbdown by No 10 over the weekend after expressing support for China’s Confucius Institutes. One insider said the change could come “within days”. Influential Conservative backbenchers on Tuesday night welcomed the anticipated move. Iain Duncan Smith, who is campaigning to be chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said a hardening of the UK’s China policy was long overdue. “It is time we stopped messing around and recognised that China poses a threat to the way we live our lives, and it is time now to treat them in the same way we treat Russia,” the former party leader said. The DfE had issued a statement expressing support for China’s 30 Confucius Institutes, which promote the teaching of Chinese language and culture in the UK – only for Downing St to demand it made a firmer response. The revised statement said the “UK government is committed to doing more to adapt to China’s growing impact” and encouraged anybody with concerns about any of the Confucius Institute’s activities to report them. A report by the Henry Jackson Society thinktank had concluded most of the institutes were engaged in activities beyond their formal remit, including political lobbying and expanding China’s reach into advanced manufacturing. Truss has adopted a hawkish stance on China for some time – at one point leading opposition within the cabinet to TikTok moving its global headquarters to London – but her predecessor in Downing St was insistent on a more nuanced approach. In a private meeting Johnson once described himself as “fervently Sinophile”, a position out of kilter with many on the Conservative benches, who have been lobbying for a tougher approach for the fast few years. Britain’s stance towards China has swung dramatically in less than a decade, from the “golden era” proclaimed by David Cameron in 2015, the year in which its president, Xi Jinping, was granted a state visit to the UK. Beijing signalled it was keen to invest in strategic industries in Britain, such as nuclear power. But as Xi adopted a more authoritarian tone at home, concern among Conservatives grew, fuelled further by the desire of both the Trump and Biden administrations in the US to strike a more assertive approach in their dealings with Beijing. Pressure from the US and Conservative MPs had forced Johnson into a U-turn over Chinese telecoms equipment supplier Huawei in July 2020 over 5G. Huawei kit was banned from UK networks from 2027, although it was accompanied by a warning that this would delay 5G rollout by three years and cost an extra £7bn. The previous definition of China was contained in the Integrated Review of defence and foreign policy published in March 2021, which sought to balance concerns about China’s authoritarian government with the need to collaborate on economic and climate issues. It was intended to set the tone for Britain’s global strategy for the next five years, but like many Johnson-era policies has been rapidly recast by Truss in her first weeks in government. Downing Street said the prime minister had commissioned an update to the Integrated Review partly in response to an increasingly aggressive China. “As she has said, Russia remains the biggest threat to the UK but China represents the most serious long-term threat to our values and way of life,” a spokesperson added. Earlier on Tuesday Jeremy Fleming, the head of spy agency GCHQ, said Beijing’s efforts to exploit control and surveillance capabilities in emerging technologies such as satellite location systems and digital currencies represents “a threat to us all”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/05/turbines-are-an-eyesore-sounds-like-a-wind-up","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-05T16:44:37Z","webTitle":"Turbines are an eyesore?

The hustings event on Thursday in Cheltenham, a key Tory-held marginal seat, also saw the foreign secretary effectively rule out any increased windfall tax on energy firm profits, as she hit out at the “depressing” sight of fields used for solar power. Sunak’s vehement comments came after Truss, in her own Q&amp;A session at the event, reiterated her belief that tax cuts should be the main response to soaring bills. Truss told the audience of Tory members this would always be her “first port of call”, followed by a focus on longer-term energy supply issues such as support for fracking and nuclear power. Also promising she would not call an election before 2024, Truss said she could provide other assistance, but gave no details, saying she “can’t write the chancellor’s budget” before even being elected as prime minister. “If the answer to every question is raising tax, we will choke off economic growth, and we will send ourselves to penury, and I think that’s a massive problem,” she argued. Speaking after her, Sunak castigated Truss for what he said was a lack of action to help people who would not benefit from her planned reduction in national insurance contributions, including pensioners and those not in work. “We are going to, as a Conservative government, leave millions of incredibly vulnerable people at the risk of real destitution,” the former chancellor said. “And I think that’s a real moral failure.” To do this would mean “the country will never, ever forgive us”, he added. Truss also said she would “absolutely” not support a wider windfall tax, saying: “I don’t think profit is a dirty word.” She added: “I think it’s a Labour idea. It’s all about bashing business, and it sends the wrong message to international investors and to the public.” Asked about an early election, she pledged: “I will not have an election before 2024. I think that’s a very important point, because we’ve got to deliver for people.” Quizzed about agricultural land, Truss hit out at its use for solar panels: “I think one of the most depressing sights when you’re driving through England is seeing fields that should be full of crops or livestock, full of solar panels.” She added: “I’m not against solar panels per se. There are plenty of commercial roofs in Britain where we could be putting solar panels. But where they shouldn’t be is on agricultural land that should be used for food production.” Sunak, widely seen as lagging well behind Truss among Tory members, pitched his appeal as a PM who could appeal to floating voters. Cheltenham is currently held by Tory MP Alex Chalk, who introduced Sunak, but with a majority of less than 1,000 over the Liberal Democrats. Asked how he could win over waverers, Sunak explicitly contrasted his style against that of Boris Johnson: “What they want is a government that works competently, seriously, with decency and integrity at the heart of everything it does. “That’s the kind of government I’m going to lead, and that’s how we’re going to win the election.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-05T14:34:04Z","webTitle":"Cold snap poses first test of Britain’s efforts to prevent winter power cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Cold snap poses first test of Britain’s efforts to prevent winter power cuts","bodyText":"As the first big snowfall of winter threatens to drop this week, it’s not only the forecasters and road gritters who will be twitchy: Britain’s energy executives and policymakers are on tenterhooks. Many Britons who have held off putting on the heating, afraid of the bulging bills that could follow, may be forced to nudge the thermostat up, putting a strain on the country’s power supplies. National Grid has warned that a confluence of scenarios including a cold snap and a cut-off of Russian gas to Europe could lead to power cuts. Is this the first piece of that grim jigsaw? An initial assessment appears far more positive than two months ago. Other European countries have filled their gas storage facilities more rapidly than expected, meaning UK competition for supplies has reduced. In fact, Europe’s storage is so full, some tankers carrying liquified natural gas (LNG) have even been idling in European waters, waiting for prices to bounce back. Mother Nature has also played a part: the mild start to winter reduced demand, with some bosses reporting consumption had fallen more than 10% on last year. But while temperatures have been unseasonably warm, wind speeds have been more concerning. Last week dunkelflaute (German for a “dark lull”) conditions – with barely any wind or solar power available to generate electricity on grey, still days – left gas as a key power source. National Grid data showed the fossil fuel was responsible for as much as 60% of Great Britain’s electricity generation for much of last week, far higher than its average of about 40% at this time of year, while wind was only 7%. The conditions were concerning enough for National Grid to flirt with using its demand flexibility service, which incentivises businesses and consumers to shift their power usage, although ultimately it stopped short. Freezing conditions predicted in Europe for mid-December are also driving sentiment. Gas accounted for 49% of electricity generation on Monday, while wind was far healthier than last week at 25%, with nuclear and biomass providing a steady 12% and 6% behind that. However, the cold weather was enough to get energy traders moving – the price of gas for delivery on Tuesday rose 6% to 340p, nearing a three-month high set earlier this month. Rising prices also have implications for the government’s energy price guarantee, which covers the cost for suppliers between wholesale prices and a fixed cost. The higher gas prices are, the bigger the eventual bill for the government. Nathan Piper, an oil and gas analyst at Investec, says: “It could have been a false dawn thinking we had sorted out the gas issue earlier in autumn. If we get cold and still winter conditions there could still be issues – that’s why we have seen gas prices go up.” He says market watchers now believe gas prices will peak next winter, because of the uncertainty over how Europe will replace the six months of significant Russian gas supplies that were available this year. One of Britain’s strengths is its diversity of energy supplies: gas from the North Sea and Norway, and LNG from around the globe, notably the US and Qatar. In electricity, there is wind and solar, nuclear, biomass – particularly from the heavily subsidised Drax power station in North Yorkshire – and a small amount of coal. Government efforts to boost supplies this winter have included paying to keep coal units set for retirement on standby. (These have not yet been exercised). The revived gas storage facilities at Centrica’s Rough – shut down after the government refused to support it – have also been called into action, although Britain’s gas storage is far lower than other European countries. A factor to watch will be the role of interconnectors – the vast undersea cables carrying gas and electricity to and from Britain, Belgium and France. Britain has built goodwill over the summer, providing LNG to Europe; however, any suggestion France could be short of energy supplies this winter could test relations already dented by Brexit. Although France was not as reliant as its neighbours on Russian gas, problems getting several nuclear power stations back online after maintenance have reduced its electricity production. If Emmanuel Macron’s government limited supplies to Britain to protect its own citizens, it would risk a valuable long-term relationship (upcoming World Cup quarter-finals notwithstanding). “It may not come down to resource nationalism,” Piper says. “If France doesn’t have the power to export, then the situation could get tight.” Issues with hydroelectric power imports from Norway this year have also caused concern. The prospect of snowy conditions will also train minds on a much-debated £18m government campaign to encourage households to cut their energy usage. The debate over whether to launch a public information campaign has pitched Conservative ideology over “nanny state intervention” against practical calls to save energy and money. It is expected before Christmas, months after similar drives in elsewhere in Europe, which have led to a 15% cut in consumption. Simon Virley, a vice-chair and the head of energy and natural resources at KPMG, says: “As we approach the first significant cold snap of the winter, improving energy efficiency and reducing demand couldn’t be more important – both to get bills down and to ensure people can heat their homes properly. “The government has now signed off an energy efficiency campaign but the overall aim of getting demand down by 15% by 2030 is less ambitious than in many European countries which are already on course to achieve that this winter.” Snowfall this week could prove the energy industry’s first big test of an extraordinary winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/01/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-281-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-01T01:11:36Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 281 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/01/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-281-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/01/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-281-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 281 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine’s military said Russia had pulled some troops from towns on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Kherson city, the first official Ukrainian report of a Russian withdrawal on the main frontline in the south. The statement gave only limited details and made no mention of any Ukrainian forces having crossed the Dnipro. Ukrainian officials also stressed that Russia had intensified shelling across the river, knocking out power again in Kherson where electricity had only begun to be restored nearly three weeks after Russian troops vacated the city and fled across the river. An investigation is under way into a suspected letter bomb sent to the US embassy in Madrid. It would be the sixth after five were sent to the Ukrainian embassy, Spanish politicians, a Spanish airbase and a company that makes rocket launchers on Wednesday. Spanish police confirmed to the Reuters news agency that an envelope similar to the previous letter bombs had been intercepted at the embassy. A private energy company in Ukraine has said that 40% of the country’s power infrastructure is damaged, as Russian attacks continue to target the supply. Millions have been without or with intermittent power since October, as Russia has focused its attacks on Ukraine’s energy system. As Ukrainians wake up on the first official day of winter, nearly 6 million people across a majority of Ukraine’s regions have no electricity, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday night. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said nine people had been killed in fires, after breaking safety rules in an attempt to heat their homes after Russian attacks on power facilities. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said that it was impossible to discuss nuclear arms control while the war in Ukraine continues, claiming the “western involvement” must not be ignored. Lavrov said that the US was trying to break up Russia, and that it was “naive” to think talks could take place while this happened. Ukraine dismissed the deputy chief engineer of its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, accusing him of collaborating with Moscow’s forces and treason, the Energoatom state nuclear energy company said. The statement was published a day after Russia said it had promoted the engineer, Yuriy Chernichuk, to serve as the director of the vast nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine. The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, has urged China’s top leaders to use their influence over Russia to end the war in Ukraine. Michel, who chairs EU leader summits, held talks with Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on Thursday, in the first face-to-face encounter between the head of an EU institution and China’s top officials since the start of the pandemic. Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz has said that Europe should go back to its prewar “peace order” with Russia if Russian president Vladimir Putin will renounce aggression against his neighbours, according to a report in the Times of his comments at a security conference in Berlin. The US army awarded a $1.2bn contract to Raytheon Technologies Co for six national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (Nasams) for Ukraine on Wednesday, the Pentagon said. The United States has approved sending Ukraine a total of eight Nasams to help fend off Russian missile and drone attacks. Russia said on Thursday the German parliament’s move to recognise the 1932-33 famine in Ukraine as a Soviet-imposed genocide was an anti-Russian provocation and an attempt by Germany to whitewash its Nazi past. In a decision welcomed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, German lawmakers passed a resolution on Wednesday declaring the death by starvation of millions of Ukrainians – the Holodomor – was genocide. Another PoW exchange will take place later on Thursday between Russia and Ukraine. Fifty prisoners of war will be handed over in the latest swap between the two sides. The UN appealed for record funds for aid next year, AFP reports, as the Ukraine war and other conflicts, climate emergencies and the still-simmering pandemic push more people into crisis, and some towards famine. The United Nations’ annual Global Humanitarian Overview estimated that 339 million people worldwide will need some form of emergency assistance next year – a staggering 65 million more people than the estimate a year ago. France has become the first major western state to publicly back the creation of a special tribunal to try senior Russian officials – potentially including Vladimir Putin – for the crime of aggression in Ukraine. Russian forces tried to advance in eastern Ukraine and trained tank, mortar and artillery fire on Kherson in the south, the Ukrainian military said, as western allies sought to buttress Ukraine and its neighbours against Moscow. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called for the EU to include Russia’s missile industry in its next sanctions package. Kuleba says it is warranted for their part in Russia’s war efforts, including those which have targeted Ukraine’s power infrastructure. Ukraine needs the US made Patriot missile defence systems to protect its civilian infrastructure, under heavy attack by Russia, foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, adding he would be working with the German government on this issue. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot systems, Reuters reported. The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against 22 Russians, including those the Foreign Office says were involved in enlisting criminals to fight in Ukraine. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said on Wednesday his department would target a new set of officials, including Denis Manturov, the deputy prime minister, who is responsible for troop equipment supplies. US president Joe Biden’s nominee to be ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, pledged on Wednesday to make the release of detained Americans a priority if she is confirmed to one of most important, and challenging, US diplomatic posts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/25/first-thing-tributes-paid-to-queen-of-rock-and-soul-tina-turner","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T08:26:26Z","webTitle":"Tributes paid to ‘queen of rock and soul’ Tina Turner | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/25/first-thing-tributes-paid-to-queen-of-rock-and-soul-tina-turner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/25/first-thing-tributes-paid-to-queen-of-rock-and-soul-tina-turner","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: Tributes paid to ‘queen of rock and soul’ Tina Turner","bodyText":"Good morning. Tina Turner, the pioneering rock’n’roll star who became a pop behemoth in the 1980s, has died aged 83 after a long illness. An outpouring of tributes emerged online following the announcement. In a statement on Wednesday night, her publicist, Bernard Doherty, said: “Tina Turner, the ‘Queen of Rock’n’Roll’ has died peacefully today at the age of 83 after a long illness in her home in Küsnacht near Zurich, Switzerland. With her, the world loses a music legend and a role model.” Turner affirmed and amplified Black women’s formative stake in rock’n’roll, defining that era of music to the extent that Mick Jagger admitted to taking inspiration from her high-kicking, energetic live performances for his stage persona. On Instagram, Jagger shared his grief over Turner’s death. “I’m so saddened by the passing of my wonderful friend Tina Turner,” he wrote. “She was truly an enormously talented performer and singer. She was inspiring, warm, funny and generous. She helped me so much when I was young and I will never forget her.” The singer Diana Ross shared a picture of herself with Turner on Twitter, writing: “Shocked. Saddened. Sending condolences to Tina Turner’s family and loved ones.” When did her career start? In the 1960s with her abusive husband Ike Turner. After two decades of working with him, she struck out alone and – after a few false starts – became one of the defining pop icons of the 1980s with the album Private Dancer. Her life was chronicled in three memoirs, a biopic, a jukebox musical, and in 2021, the acclaimed documentary film, Tina. Read her obituary here. What was the cause of death? It’s unclear but she had suffered ill health in recent years, being diagnosed with intestinal cancer in 2016 and having a kidney transplant in 2017. Florida governor Ron DeSantis announces 2024 presidential bid The governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, has officially declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president, rolling out the news with a campaign video and a glitch-riddled event on Twitter with the owner of the social media site, Elon Musk. DeSantis filed paperwork yesterday with the Federal Election Commission, before his planned event with Musk and an interview with Fox News later yesterday evening. As governor of Florida, DeSantis has pursued divisive, culture war-focused policies, including signing a six-week abortion ban and targeting the teaching of LGBTQ+ and race issues in public schools. In his campaign video, DeSantis said he was running to “lead our great American comeback” and pitched Florida as a model for the nation. “We proved it can be done,” DeSantis said in a voiceover. “We chose facts over fear, education over indoctrination, law and order over rioting and disorder.” How did the Twitter launch go? Not well. The event marked the first time a major candidate had announced their run for president on social media and nearly 600,000 listeners tuned in to Spaces, Twitter’s dedicated audio streaming feature, but the results were a disaster. As the live stream began, the audio line experienced feedback, outages and garbled audio. Many users reported their Twitter apps crashing or logging them out as they tried to join the stream. What do we know about DeSantis? The Florida governor claims “blue-collar roots” and an Ivy League education but has pursued hard-right policies as he seeks to take on Donald Trump. Here are 10 things to know about Ron DeSantis. US lawmakers blame each other for debt ceiling standoff: ‘They are not negotiating’ Lawmakers exchanged sharp criticism about who was to blame for the protracted standoff over the debt ceiling yesterday. As the country nears its deadline to avoid a federal default, talks between Joe Biden and the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, continued on Wednesday, as negotiators met again to hash out the details of a potential deal. But both parties simultaneously traded pointed remarks, underscoring that an agreement is not yet in reach. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, pushed back against Republicans’ insistence on spending cuts. Jayapal said she spoke on Tuesday to White House officials who informed her that Republican negotiators had already rejected $3tn worth of deficit-reduction proposals, such as ending tax subsidies for large oil companies and closing the carried-interest loophole. “It is not actually about debt or deficit,” Jayapal said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon. “It is about keeping the cash flowing to the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations.” What are the stumbling blocks? McCarthy said that he would not support a “clean” bill raising the debt ceiling without cutting government spending and accused Biden of acquiescing to the “extreme” wing of his party. Rejecting the White House’s efforts to reduce the federal deficit by raising more tax revenue, McCarthy insisted that any agreement must focus on the spending side. “We have to spend less than we spent last year,” McCarthy said. “It’s not a revenue problem. It’s a spending problem.” What has the White House said? The White House voiced optimism that a deal could still be struck, saying the talks remained “productive”. “If it keeps going in good faith, then we can get to an agreement here that is bipartisan and that will get out of the House and get out of the Senate,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary.

Stat of the day: One in five deaths among young Californians tied to fentanyl Overdoses involving fentanyl were behind one in five deaths of people aged 15 to 24 in California, the latest indicator of an emergency that shows no signs of slowing. Drug overdoses now kill two to three times as many people in the state as car accidents, according to data compiled by the consulting group California Health Policy Strategies. Since 2017, deaths related to the synthetic opioid, which is 50 times stronger than heroin, have increased 1,027%. The crisis, which has visibly unfolded on city streets from San Francisco to Los Angeles, has sent officials scrambling for solutions. This year California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, proposed spending an additional $172m for a project distributing Naloxone, an overdose medication. But experts warn that more is needed and that the effects of the crisis will probably continue for years to come. Don’t miss this: ‘This is an epidemic’– inside the Thai clinic taking on westerners’ gaming addictions Muay Thai and meditation, mindfulness and massage: the schedule at the Cabin addiction treatment centre could easily be mistaken for that of a wellness retreat or luxury hotel. The Cabin previously catered to people with substance and alcohol addictions. But in 2016 it launched a specialised programme for gaming addicts. In 2022, the World Health Organization added “internet gaming disorder” to its International Classification of Diseases, defining the addiction, which affects between 2% and 3% of users, as a pattern of gaming behaviour that “takes precedence over other interests and daily activities”. In some cases, gamers can forget to eat or sleep, losing jobs and relationships in the process. In one incident in South Korea, a newborn starved to death while her parents gamed, and last year a 12-year-old Australian boy killed himself amid a gaming addiction. Climate check: Invasion of Ukraine ‘has fuelled funding boom for clean energy’ Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment which will significantly outpace spending on fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. A report from the IEA has found that clean energy investment is on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year as investors turn to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. At the same time investment in coal, gas and oil will rise to just over $1tn, the IEA said. The Paris-based agency found that clean energy investments have been boosted by many factors including periods of strong economic growth and volatile fossil fuel prices, as well as heightened concerns about energy security after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Last Thing: What lies beneath – Florida man finds iguana lurking in his toilet bowl Hearing “splashing” coming from his toilet, a 58-year-old Florida man looked into the bowl and found an iguana. “I look down, and I see this frightened-looking reptile looking back at me,” John Riddle, of Hollywood, told the Orlando Sentinel. An attempt to use a pool net to remove the lurking lavatorial lizard came to no good, so Riddle “worked up enough nerve to try to grab him” with his bare hands. The iguana swam “all the way into the toilet, into the pipe. I couldn’t see any of him,” Riddle said. “I’m used to [iguanas],” Riddle said, “but I’m just not used to them in my toilet bowl.” Iguanas in toilets may sound like an urban myth on a par with alligators in the sewers of New York City but in Florida they have become a very real problem.

The technical malfunction, compounded by human error – control room workers misread confusing signals and halted the emergency water cooling system – heated the nuclear core to dangerously high levels. The film The China Syndrome was still in theaters, starring Jane Fonda as a television reporter investigating cover-ups at a nuclear power plant whose meltdown could release radioactive material deep into the earth, “all the way to China”. Three Mile Island – still the worst commercial nuclear accident in US history – was no China Syndrome, but it got terrifyingly close to catastrophic, Chernobyl-level damage. As the Netflix docuseries Meltdown: Three Mile Island recounts, Unit 2 came less than half an hour from fully melting down – a disaster scenario that would have sickened hundreds of thousands in the surrounding area. Two days after the accident, an explosive bubble of hydrogen gas was found in the reactor. The plant’s operator, Metropolitan Edison, tried to downplay the risk of radioactive releases, but panic ensued; more than 100,000 people fled the surrounding area. Plant technicians were eventually able to slowly bleed the gas from the cooling reactor, avoiding a deadly explosion. Though workers inside the plant were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation, it remains unknown how much contamination escaped the facility into the surrounding community. That is the story of Three Mile Island that most Americans will find in the history textbooks, if they have heard of the accident at all. The first two of Meltdown’s four 45-minute episodes focus on this chilling near-miss, as well as the obfuscation and confusion that greatly eroded public trust in nuclear power. But the story of Three Mile Island did not end with the five-day red-alert saga – not for the workers tasked with safely cleaning up the molten reactor, nor for the surrounding community, disillusioned and furious. In its second half, Meltdown, directed by Kief Davidson, homes in on the story of Rick Parks, a cleanup supervisor turned whistleblower on the Bechtel Corp, the company hired to conduct the billion-dollar cleanup by Metropolitan Edison and supervised by the government’s Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). “While a lot of people know about the disaster, they don’t know about what happened in the cleanup phase and how close we were to another disaster,” Davidson told the Guardian. “We dodged a bullet a second time, and it was entirely due to the fact that Rick Parks and [fellow whistleblower] Larry King stood up. “We should know about these stories,” he added. “We should be able to look at the people who risk everything in order to save communities from a potential disaster.” Parks, a Missouri native and navy-trained nuclear operator who provides colorful, refreshingly straight-shooting narration throughout the series, moved to Middletown, Pennsylvania – the town directly adjacent to Three Mile Island – to work on cleanup three years after the accident. At the time, Bechtel was the largest private construction company in the world, with numerous Reagan administration officials on its board. The cleanup was risky, arduous and behind schedule. Bechtel received funds upon completion of individual tasks, incentivizing the company and its hirer, General Public Utilities (GPU), to cut corners and ignore NRC regulations. Parks was particularly alarmed by rushed, off-books repairs to a polar crane damaged by radioactivity. The crane was supposed to lift the head off the reactor to expose the core; according to Park and the series, if the faulty crane malfunctioned and dropped its load on to the core, the resulting damage could have caused a radioactive leak on par with the China Syndrome. When Parks and two other employees, King and Ed Gischel, took their concerns to higher-ups at GPU and the NRC, they were dismissed. Gischel was recommended for a psychological evaluation. Parks found marijuana placed in his car on the day of a random drug inspection; someone later broke into his apartment and searched his files. (The NRC’s on-site coordinator, Lake Bennett, participates in the series and claims to not remember meeting Parks. He later say whatever Parks told him did not merit concern – “I was satisfied that that crane was safe enough.”) Gravely concerned for the safety of family, Middletown and a potentially statewide disaster zone, Parks took his records to the Government Accountability Project, then went public days before a vote would certify the crane’s use. His disclosures and mounting public pressure caused the NRC to halt and then overhaul the cleanup process at Three Mile Island. Carla Shamberg, Meltdown’s executive producer, first heard of Parks through lawyers for the Government Accountability Project, some of whom appear in the series, while executive-producing another project: the 2000 film Erin Brockovich, starring Julia Roberts as a real-life whistleblower. It’s taken nearly 20 years since for some version of it to make it to air. Parks and other whistleblowers were “superheroes”, she told the Guardian. “They’re one of the last bastions of the truth.” “I think they should have capes,” she said. “They’re just amazing. They protect people they’ve never met and they protect thousands, if not millions, of people. It’s the bravest thing I’ve ever seen anybody do.” Parks’s story has a relatively happy ending – the series delves into the personal and emotional costs of his disclosures, but the damaged crane was not used. In 1983, the same year he came forward, Metropolitan Edison was indicted on criminal charges of falsifying safety reports before the accident; the company’s plea bargain included a $45,000 fine and $1m pledge to help emergency planning in the surrounding area. Still, in the four decades since, “it hasn’t gotten better for whistleblowers,” said Davidson. “To go public now is a lot different than it was even 10 years ago. It’s a lot harder now. Whistleblowers aren’t always rewarded for their actions.” To this day, the official government record is that radiation released at Three Mile Island never reached levels dangerous to humans; the official death toll is zero. But local residents turned activists, several of whom appear in the series, say otherwise. The film cites a 1997 study by epidemiologist Steven Wing, which found cancer rates two to three times the average in areas downwind of the facility. In 2017, researchers at Penn State College of Medicine found that a certain type of thyroid cancer was common in people who had been near the plant after the accident. Several subjects in the series – including Parks and his ex-stepdaughter Nicole, who was six years old at the time of the disaster – have survived bouts of cancer or lost loved ones to it. No one can be sure it’s related to radiation – Parks, who had throat cancer, was also a smoker, “so there’s always that but, and that’s why the NRC gets away with everything,” he says. But the anecdotes point to more than a coincidence. Still, “the project isn’t about how is the cancer, who got cancer, how many people got it,” said Davidson. Instead, the series argues for “holding industry and large corporations accountable for their actions. “We’re not coming into this story from a pro-nuclear standpoint,” said Davidson. “There’s pros and cons and arguments to both sides, and a lot of the characters that we’ve interviewed for this, like Rick Parks, really believe that to solve our energy crisis nuclear has to be in the mix. “But there’s consequences that have to be looked at. And when things go wrong, it can go wrong in a pretty horrible way,” he added. Or, as Parks says in the final episode: “We’ll never have a viable nuclear industry in this country until we take the profit motive out of it.” • This article was amended on 6 May 2022 to correct the spelling of Ed Gischel’s surname."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2021/mar/23/labour-urges-ministers-to-back-uk-steel-with-buy-british-pledge","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-03-23T22:30:22Z","webTitle":"Labour urges ministers to back UK steel with ‘buy British’ pledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/23/labour-urges-ministers-to-back-uk-steel-with-buy-british-pledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/mar/23/labour-urges-ministers-to-back-uk-steel-with-buy-british-pledge","fields":{"headline":"Labour urges ministers to back UK steel with ‘buy British’ pledge","bodyText":"The Labour party has called for the government to commit to “buy British” when sourcing steel for big infrastructure projects such as railways and nuclear power stations. Projects such as the HS2 high-speed railway and Hinkley Point C nuclear power station would be expected to buy more British steel under the policy, which is backed by the under-pressure industry. Labour also wants the government to set a target for UK steel content in big public works and give UK steel preferred status in contracts. The government this month set up a steel procurement taskforce led by the former Barclays chair Lord Grimstone to look at ways of boosting the industry, which is seen as a key supplier to defence as well as infrastructure. The government has identified a need for nearly 5m tonnes of steel over the next decade for infrastructure. However, it has so far stopped short of directly mandating that public projects use UK-based suppliers such as Liberty, or rivals including Indian-owned Tata Steel or British Steel, which was rescued a year ago by China’s Jingye. Stronger “buy British” guarantees in procurement notices would increase the direct benefit to the UK of infrastructure spending, said Lucy Powell, the shadow minister for business and consumers. “Having domestic steelmaking capacity is a cornerstone of our national security, economic prosperity and our fight to tackle the climate emergency, yet ministers are failing to back UK steelmaking with weak procurement practices that undermine these efforts,” she said. Labour’s intervention comes with questions hanging over the future of Liberty Steel, the UK’s third-largest steelmaker. Liberty’s owner, the industrialist Sanjeev Gupta, is trying to secure new loans after the collapse of its major backer, Greensill Capital. Gupta’s GFG Alliance is trying to negotiate a standstill agreement with Greensill’s administrators. A pledge to buy more British steel could potentially help Liberty Steel. For instance, steel bars produced in Rotherham would be candidates for building railways such as HS2 as well as offshore wind turbines. Many of the workers in Rotherham have been furloughed owing to lower demand in particular from the aerospace industry during the pandemic. It is understood that about a third of Liberty’s 5,000 workers have been furloughed as the company seeks to keep cash in the business until it can find new funding. Labour said its analysis of government data showed that £25m, almost a quarter of spending on steel for infrastructure, went abroad in 2018-19, the last year for which figures are available. UK Steel, a lobby group for the industry, backed the call for work to remain in the UK where possible. It calculates that 1,000 tonnes of steel produced in the UK helps to support about 4.5 jobs directly. Overall there are about 33,000 British steelworkers, plus another 74,000 workers in closely linked jobs, the lobby group said. “Government should always seek to promote British foundation industries, such as steel, through sensible, targeted and job-boosting public procurement,” said Gareth Stace, UK Steel’s director general. “When government-funded projects buy foreign steel, this money is then lost to the UK economy forever. We welcome proposals that keeps UK taxpayers’ money in steel communities and the UK economy.” David Bailey, a professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said increased procurement from the UK would help the industry, but added that government action was also needed on business rates and energy costs that are 62% higher than German rivals, according to industry calculations from 2019. “The UK government used to hide behind state aid rules,” Bailey said, referring to EU law. “It has no excuse not to act now.” A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Steel will play a critical role in providing the infrastructure necessary to drive a green economic recovery and project jobs,” highlighting wind farms, nuclear power stations and electric cars. “The government is currently reviewing its public procurement rules to ensure the system is better able to meet the needs of this country, whilst complying with our international obligations,” the spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/mar/09/keir-starmer-says-pms-failed-energy-policy-is-causing-bills-to-rocket","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-09T13:42:21Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer says PM’s ‘failed energy policy’ is causing bills to rocket","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/09/keir-starmer-says-pms-failed-energy-policy-is-causing-bills-to-rocket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/mar/09/keir-starmer-says-pms-failed-energy-policy-is-causing-bills-to-rocket","fields":{"headline":"Keir Starmer says PM’s ‘failed energy policy’ is causing bills to rocket","bodyText":"Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of presiding over a “failed energy policy” that is resulting in rocketing bills, as he called for the government to invest in nuclear and renewable energy sources and insulate homes to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas. The Labour leader used prime minister’s questions to repeatedly link the impact of the invasion of Ukraine to the cost of living crisis, an issue where many Conservative MPs want to see more robust action from ministers. Starmer called for more direct help to cut energy bills, including a windfall tax on oil companies, but also demanded urgent action to reduce reliance on hydrocarbons, including an end to a de facto ban on new onshore wind projects. Johnson argued against a windfall tax and said existing efforts to help with energy bills were generous. Starmer responded with derision, saying: “I don’t think the prime minister understands the mess he’s in.” The government, Starmer said, should be “starting a new era of energy policy, never again at the mercy of a dictator”, including more nuclear power, “sprinting” for more renewables, and rapid moves to insulate homes. “So why is the prime minister offering the same failed energy policy that cast us into the security crisis and allowed bills to rocket?” Starmer asked. Johnson argued the government had already introduced “unprecedented measures” to help with bills, including a one-off £200 loan to offset energy costs and £150 for some households towards council tax. Johnson dismissed the idea of a windfall tax, saying: “The net result of that would be to see the oil companies put their prices up yet higher, and make it more difficult for them to do what we need them to do … and that is divesting from dependence on Russian oil and gas. That is the way forward for this country – it is to take a sober, responsible approach.” But Starmer noted that average energy bills were due to rise by £700 in April, with the £200 loan not arriving till October, by which point bills were likely to rise another £1,000. “It’s a total mess,” Starmer said. “So I ask again: when is the prime minister going to force the chancellor to U-turn?” After Johnson ruled out the idea of a windfall tax on the high profits from oil companies assisted by rising prices, Starmer said the prime minister was “protecting energy profits, not working people”. The Labour leader said: “Britain can’t afford another crisis like this. We need to improve our long-term energy security. That starts with supporting new nuclear and renewables.” The government had, he said, “effectively banned new onshore wind”, asking: “Will the prime minister relax planning laws, end the block on onshore wind, and stop supporting policies that make us so dependent on foreign gas?” Saying that the UK had the least energy-efficient housing stock in Europe, Starmer called for an “urgent national mission” to insulate homes, saying this could save households £400 a year in bills. “All the government has is a failed policy,” Starmer said. “Taking all their announcements together, it will take 75 years to deliver the upgrades that we need. That’s a lifetime, when we need urgent action. When is the prime minister going to get on with it?” Johnson argued that the UK was “the Saudi Arabia of wind power”, and blamed the lack of new nuclear power on Labour governments, which were last in power in 2010."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jun/23/california-last-nuclear-power-plant-save","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-23T10:00:45Z","webTitle":"The last nuclear plant in California – and the unexpected quest to save it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/23/california-last-nuclear-power-plant-save","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jun/23/california-last-nuclear-power-plant-save","fields":{"headline":"The last nuclear plant in California – and the unexpected quest to save it","bodyText":"California’s last nuclear plant was nearing the end of its life. Tucked against picturesque bluffs along California’s central coast, the aging facility known as Diablo Canyon began operating in 1985. It was designed for a different era, with analog knobs and systems that no longer comply with the state’s environmental standards. The plant has faced controversies over its impact on underwater ecosystems, the production of toxic waste and its proximity to earthquake fault lines – and its planned closure by 2025 seemed an all-but-certain step in California’s ambitious journey toward a greener future. But with just three years to go, the fate of Diablo Canyon now looks less assured. California is facing steep energy challenges that are only expected to worsen as the climate crisis intensifies. The plant still provides roughly 9% of the state’s energy – the largest single source of electricity and enough to supply more than 3 million residents. The state is still far from finding a reliable and climate-friendly replacement, and concerns are rising that it will fall back on fossil fuels to fill the gap. Now, decades-old discussions about whether the plant should continue to play a role in California’s renewable energy transition are being rehashed. A diverse league of advocates – including energy officials, scientists, California’s governor Gavin Newsom, and even the musician Grimes – are pushing for renewed life for Diablo Canyon. Critics, meanwhile, say keeping the plant open would only be a step backward. Diablo Canyon has come to signify broader questions about the state’s energy future, and whether it’s ready to leave nuclear power behind. It’s an issue also lingering in the thoughts of officials across the US. Half of the country’s clean energy comes from nuclear power plants – but in many areas, it is being phased out. “It’s a sort of a bellwether – a test – of the political future for nuclear power in California and in the shifting environmental coalitions,” said Alex Trembath, the deputy director of the Breakthrough Institute, an energy and environment thinktank that advocates in favor of nuclear energy. “I think the story of Diablo Canyon is more important than just another plant.” Protests and money problems The many plants that once dotted California have closed one by one, and a law passed in 1976 banned new construction of nuclear stations until waste could be permanently disposed of. That’s left Diablo Canyon as the sole provider of nuclear energy. Even before it began operating, Diablo Canyon was a source of scrutiny. For years it was the site of demonstrations as anti-nuclear sentiments grew in the wake of disasters like Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and later on, Fukushima. There were concerns raised about environmental degradation and questions about storage of the nuclear waste produced by the facility. But it was not the protests that led to Diablo Canyon’s closure timeline. Instead, it was a matter of money. California regulators had cracked down on the system used at Diablo Canyon in 2010, a process known as “once-through cooling” for its impact on marine life. Roughly 2.5bn gallons of seawater slosh through the plant’s enormous intake tubes each day, cooling hot steam heated by nuclear reactors. The warmed water flushed back into the sea has had profound effects on ocean ecosystems and animals, including fish, sea lions, turtles, and other creatures are killed by the millions each year by the systems themselves, according to the California water board. Facing requirements for expensive upgrades and retrofits, estimated at roughly $4.5bn, and an increasingly competitive energy market centered around renewables, the plant’s owner and operator PG&amp;E agreed to a settlement in 2016 with environmental groups and labor organizations not to seek renewal on the licenses for its two reactors, which expire in 2024 and 2025 respectively. Endorsed by state regulators in 2018, the plan also gave California nearly a decade to ramp up the decarbonization of its grid and replace the lost energy with more affordable renewable sources. Unlike other plants that shut down abruptly due to mechanical errors or financing issues, the end of Diablo Canyon was heralded as an opportunity to phase out nuclear the right way. Energy challenges amid the climate crisis But in the years since, the energy landscape has shifted. California, which has pledged to run on 100% renewable electricity by 2045, is not on track to meet its goals. In order to get there, it needs to triple its current capacity and expand renewable sources at a “record-breaking rate”, according to the state’s energy commission. The climate crisis has also put the grid under immense strain. A historic drought has left the American west with waning water levels, threatening hydropower production, and spiking temperatures have caused surges in energy use, resulting in seasonal threats of rolling blackouts. Wildfires have also threatened disruptions, taking out transmission and distribution lines. Energy officials warned it will be especially difficult to navigate seasons when climate disasters hit all at once, potentially leaving millions of Californians without power during peak times of need in the coming years. The grid has grown more efficient and reliable due to renewables coming online and upgrades in systems, but the state’s energy agencies projected a significant shortfall that matches the energy lost when Diablo Canyon ceases to contribute. Meanwhile, energy costs will continue to rise. “This is a challenge,” said Lucas Davis, an expert on energy economics and professor at the University of California Berkeley. “When a major generation source closes there is less supply so that pushes up wholesale prices,” he said. The timing is bad. With cities mandating the phase-out of natural gas and more consumers switching to electric cars, demand for electricity is also expected to increase, driving up the price further. “We will need more generation,” Davis said. There are growing concerns that the state will be forced to fall back on polluting forms of energy, including natural gas, once the Diablo Canyon goes dark. As things stand currently, California would have to increase renewable energy by 20% over the next two years, as hydroelectric power wanes, the chances of which experts said were “increasingly dim”. If decarbonization is not escalated quickly, California stands to emit an additional 15.5m metric tons of greenhouse gasses with the closure of Diablo Canyon, according to an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists published last year. Trembath, of the Breakthrough Institute, says the fact that Diablo’s closure could create more emissions rather than reduce them provides a powerful test of California’s commitment to clean energy. Keeping the plant would not hinder new sources of renewable energy, he says, rather those new sources could go toward providing more energy for the grid, rather than just plugging the gap left by Diablo. “If the plant closes it won’t mean that California can’t keep making progress,” he said. “It will just be an indication that no matter how dire or ambitious our rhetoric is about our climate goals – if we close the plant that’s a signal that it’s just rhetoric.” But Ralph Cavanagh, the energy co-director of the environmental advocacy organization Natural Resources Defense Council’s Climate and clean energy program, who was involved in negotiating the joint settlement in 2016, sees little use in rehashing old debates and instead would like to see the momentum directed into finding new sources. Either way, he said, the plant is going to close. “This ship has sailed,” Cavanagh said. A new future for nuclear? Advocates of a nuclear future, however, have envisioned new opportunities for the plant. They argue that, despite its risks, nuclear’s promise of cleaner energy is essential for helping to stave off the worse effects of climate change while bolstering the grid. Nuclear energy is a zero-emissions energy source, which doesn’t emit carbon the way other energy sources do. It produces minimal waste and –though there are always risks of disaster – officials have certified that the plants and the byproducts they produce are safe. “The challenges here in California and globally are bigger than ever and the window of opportunity to mitigate climate change is closing fast,” Steven Chu and Ernest Moniz, two former US secretaries of energy wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed in support of Diablo Canyon. They cited a 2021 study from researchers at Stanford and Massachusetts Institute of Technology that examined new opportunities for the plant, including adding desalination and hydrogen production, another type of energy that is often made from natural gas. The study, published last year, helped reignite the debate around Diablo Canyon and how to bring it up-to-date. Researchers analyzed the viability of adding new features to the aging facility and concluded that by providing grid electricity, desalinated water and hydrogen, the overall value produced by the plant would increase, which would help offset the high investment costs required. That also spurred a change in tune from the governor. Newsom helped shape discussions about closing Diablo back in 2016 as Lt Governor and chair of the tate lands commission. But this year, now facing significant energy challenges as head of the state, Newsom became outspoken in favor of prolonging its life. While he said he wants to see it shutter eventually, he told the Los Angeles Times that its current trajectory may be too soon. Still, the financial piece of the puzzle remains. Diablo Canyon will have to be upgraded if it continues to exist, and it’s unclear whether PG&amp;E will be willing to invest further in the beleaguered plant. One option could be federal funding – the Biden administration has set aside $6bn to keep existing nuclear plants open, though whether Diablo would pursue that option remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the researchers at Stanford and MIT have raised other less-costly options that could mitigate impacts on marine life, but their conclusions have been questioned by critics of the plant, including Cavanagh. He remains adamant that the issue is a non-starter, likening the new momentum to “wishful thinking”. Noting that he believes in the importance of nuclear power’s contribution to the clean energy transition and reducing carbon emissions, Cavanagh emphasized that there are still three years to go before it is scheduled to fully power down. In that time, he said, the state should prioritize and invest in transitioning to renewables and seek solutions to power problems. “The danger of Diablo Canyon,” he said, “is that it is a tempting way of somehow assuming that there’s an easy way to avoid responsibility for the next phases of the clean energy transition.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-15-missiles-shot-down-over-kyiv-as-victory-day-begins-in-russia","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-09T17:47:27Z","webTitle":"US and UK tell Russia to stop using hunger as leverage in Ukraine conflict – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-15-missiles-shot-down-over-kyiv-as-victory-day-begins-in-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-15-missiles-shot-down-over-kyiv-as-victory-day-begins-in-russia","fields":{"headline":"US and UK tell Russia to stop using hunger as leverage in Ukraine conflict – as it happened","bodyText":"The time is approaching 9pm in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Here’s a roundup of today’s news. Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine that the “whole country is praying for them”, as he used his Victory Day speech to defend his invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the 78th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president drew historical parallels between the second world war and fighting in Ukraine “Today, civilisation is again at a decisive, turning point, a real war has been unleashed against us again,” Putin said in a speech that was laced with anger. “We are proud of the participants of the special military operation. The future of our people depends on you,” Putin said. He accused the west of “destroying traditional values” and propagandising a “system of robbery and violence.” Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary force, which is fighting Russia’s battle in Bakhmut, has said he was told he and his mercenaries would be regarded as “traitors” if they abandoned their positions. Prigozhin threatened to withdraw his troops from the city in east Ukraine, which has been the site of a long-running battle since 2022 to try to capture it, because of a lack of ammunition. He then rowed back on it, but has again threatened to do so. The UK foreign secretary James Cleverly and US secretary of state Antony Blinken have urged Russia not to use hunger as a weapon of war, as discussions over the Black Sea grain deal continue. Blinken said: “In recent days, Russia has once again returned to blocking ships from sailing to Ukrainian ports to pick up grain. A cynical action, that directly results in less food getting to global food markets and to human beings in Africa, in the Middle East and around the world who need that food.The world shouldn’t need to remind Moscow every few weeks to stop using people’s hunger as a weapon in their war against Ukraine.” Russia launched about 15 cruise missiles at Ukraine’s capital on Tuesday, the second attack in as many days, with air defence systems shooting all of them down, officials said, after air raid alerts blared over most of the country. “As at the front, the plans of the aggressor failed,” Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv’s city military administration, said in comments posted on the Telegram messaging app. Popko said that according to preliminary information there were no casualties in the attack, which was carried out with cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea region. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said debris fell on a house in the Holosiivskyi district in the south-west of Kyiv, but there were no casualties and not much damage. Ukraine is planning a “very important” counteroffensive against Russian forces that must “demonstrate success”, the country’s prime minister has said. Denys Shmyhal told Sky News that the operation would be launched when the time was right. Cleverly warned that people should not get too carried away with their hopes for Ukraine’s counter offensive. “We have to be realistic. This is the real world; this is not a Hollywood movie,” he said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he discussed European integration, defence matters and sanctions against Russia at a meeting with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Kyiv. He said he expected the EU to soon approve more sanctions on Russia. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said there is currently no prospect of peace between Russia and Ukraine because “both sides are convinced that they can win”. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El País on Tuesday, Guterres was pessimistic about the EU and the UN’s ability to broker an end to the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion last year. “Unfortunately, I don’t think peace negotiations are possible at the moment,” he said. The US has announced a “new security assistance package” to help bolster Ukraine’s air defences and artillery ammunition needs. This package, confirmed by the Department of Defense on Tuesday, totals up to $1.2bn and is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). A UK-led group of European countries has asked for expressions of interest to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles. The call for responses from companies who could provide the munitions with range of up to 300km (190 miles) was included in a notice posted last week by the International Fund for Ukraine. MEPs voted to speed up consideration of a law to boost ammunition production in Europe to the tune of €500m ($550m), due to efforts to supply Ukraine. The decision should see the new legislation – snappily termed the Act in Support of Ammunition Production (Asap) – in place by the end of the year, MEPs and European Commission officials said, Agence France-Presse reports. Ukraine has received Israeli-made radar defence systems, which have already been deployed in Kyiv as of Monday, according to Israeli media reports. A Lithuanian volunteer organisation known as Blue/Yellow delivered 16 ieMHR models made by Israel’s RADA Electronic Industries last week and three are already in use in the Ukrainian capital, the Israeli daily Ha’aretz said. The systems are designed to detect aerial threats including missiles, rockets, mortar shells, helicopters and drones within up to a 10km (6.2-mile) radius. The EU must not be intimidated by Moscow’s showcasing of military power but continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Tuesday as Russia marked Victory Day with a parade. “Two thousand two hundred kilometres north-east from here, Putin is parading his soldiers, tanks and missiles today,” Scholz told lawmakers in a speech at the European parliament in Strasbourg. Germany’s foreign minister has said China could play a decisive role in ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking alongside her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, at a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, Annalena Baerbock said that as a permanent member of the UN security council, China had the power to be influential in the conflict and bring it to an end. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Russia “will prevail” in its fight against what he described as “imperialists”, the state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday, in remarks seen to be aimed at Ukraine and its western supporters such as the US. North Korea has forged closer ties with the Kremlin and backed Moscow after it invaded Ukraine last year, including its proclamation later of having annexed parts of Ukraine, which most UN members condemned as illegal. That’s all for today. Thank you for following along. The situation at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, is deteriorating, Funke Media Group has reported. According to Ukraine’s state-owned operating company Energoatom, Russia is bringing more troops and military vehicles to the site of the nuclear power plant, Reuters reports. “The situation of equipment and personnel is deteriorating,” the Energoatom president, Petro Kotin, told Funke. The UK foreign secretary and US secretary of state have urged Russia not to use global hunger as a tool of war in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, as discussions continue about the resumption of the Black Sea grain deal. Speaking at a joint press conference in Washington, James Cleverly and Antony Blinken spoke about the war, as well as relations with China and the recent evacuation of nationals in Sudan amid the country falling into civil war. Speaking first, Blinken said: “We are urging Russia to extend and expand the Black Sea grain initiative. In recent days, Russia has once again returned to blocking ships from sailing to Ukrainian ports to pick up grain. A cynical action, that directly results in less food getting to global food markets and to human beings in Africa, in the Middle East and around the world who need that food. “While we are grateful for the tireless efforts of [UN] general secretary Guterres, our colleagues in Turkey, working to break this impasse, the world shouldn’t need to remind Moscow every few weeks to stop using people’s hunger as a weapon in their war against Ukraine.” The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will visit the US in June, where he will meet Joe Biden in Washington. London will host the Ukraine rebuilding conference in the same month, in an attempt to examine how cities, towns and infrastructure will recover post-conflict. Cleverly struck the same tone. After thanking Blinken for his remarks, including congratulations sent to King Charles III on his coronation, the foreign secretary said: “Just as we did with Sudan, we remain focused on the needs of some of the poorest people in the world. I echo your comments on the Black Sea grain initiative. “It is completely wrong that Russia uses the hunger of some of the poorest people in the world to pursue leverage in this conflict. They should resign the Black Sea grain initiative and do so immediately, they should unlock the supply of food to go to those people around the world who need it most and it is perverse that they are using hunger in the developing world as leverage in their conflict in Ukraine.” Some more on the comments by James Cleverly in the US. The UK foreign secretary said that Ukraine’s offensive may not be “decisive” in an attempt to play down expectations of a “Hollywood” style sweep to retake occupied areas of the country. On a visit to Washington he said that more aid must be delivered, but added: “They have demonstrated themselves to be very, very effective defenders of their country, but we need to recognise that there might not be a simple, quick, decisive breakthrough,” Cleverly said at the Atlantic Council, Agence France-Presse reports. “I hope and expect they will do very, very well, because whenever I’ve seen the Ukrainians they have outperformed expectations. “But we have to be realistic. This is the real world; this is not a Hollywood movie,” he said. Cleverly called for western powers “to have the resolve to continue to do the right thing” no matter how the offensive progresses, including the prospect of “escalatory words” from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. “If we don’t, what’s at stake is of immeasurable importance,” he said. UK foreign secretary James Cleverly has told a US audience at the Atlantic Council that he would welcome China’s involvement in helping bring the war in Ukraine to an end. He said: “I don’t think we should be ‘dog in the manger’ about this. We know that Xi enjoys a significant degree of influence with Vladimir Putin. If he can use that influence to deliver on what he has publicly stated he feels strongly about, sovereignty, territorial integrity, the non-use of nuclear weapons, the non-threat of nuclear weapons, then why would we be critical of that intervention, if it is meaningful and if he actually delivers upon it. Two big ifs. “If through his intervention he can help restore the sovereignty of Ukraine, and get Russian troops out of that country, I’m not going to be critical of that.” A UK-led group of European countries has asked for expressions of interest to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles in what would be another step-up in military support for Kyiv against Russia’s invasion. The call for responses from companies who could provide the munitions with range of up to 300km (190 miles) was included in a notice posted last week by the International Fund for Ukraine – a group of countries including Britain, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden – set up to send weapons to Kyiv, Reuters reports. The UK’s Ministry of Defence, which runs the fund, asked companies to get in touch if they could provide missiles that can be launched from land, sea or air with a payload of between 20 and 490kg (44 and 1,078lbs). The notice asked for other desirable requirements including a “low probability of intercept”, “mission planning capability”, and “air defence penetration methods to increase probability of successful strike”. The notice said companies that responded would be contacted from 5 June. A British official said no final decision had been made to send missiles with these capabilities to Ukraine. The US has announced a “new security assistance package” to help bolster Ukraine’s air defences and artillery ammunition needs. This package, confirmed by the Department of Defense on Tuesday, totals up to $1.2bn and is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). In a statement this afternoon, the DoD said: This USAI package underscores the continued US commitment to meeting Ukraine’s most urgent requirements by committing critical near-term capabilities, such as air defence systems and munitions, while also building the capacity of Ukraine’s armed forces to defend its territory and deter Russian aggression over the long term. This includes committing additional 155mm artillery rounds and sustainment support to enable Ukraine to better maintain its on-hand systems and equipment. The package includes funding for additional air defence systems and munitions; equipment to integrate western air defence launchers, missiles and radars with Ukraine’s air defence systems; ammunition for counter-unmanned aerial systems; 155mm artillery rounds; commercial satellite imagery services; and support for training, maintenance and sustainment activities. A large installation representing Russian atrocities in Ukraine blocked the path of Russia’s ambassador to Poland as he sought to place a wreath at a Warsaw memorial to Soviet soldiers on Russia’s Victory Day holiday. The installation included hundreds of fluttering blue and yellow Ukrainian flags and crosses serving as symbolic grave markers for Ukrainians killed by Russians during the full-scale war launched by Moscow last year. A pool of fake blood below the crosses underlined the stark message of the protest, which was created by Euromaidan-Warszawa, a citizens’ initiative that supports Ukraine. One organiser, Viktoria Pogrebniak, said the installation, set up for the day at the entrance to the Red Army memorial site, was meant to fight back against Russian propaganda and “show the real picture to the world”. “We are bombed, we are killed, we are raped,” she said. “We are killed just because we are Ukrainians.” A tumultuous year of fighting has passed since Vladimir Putin last addressed Russian soldiers on Red Square in Moscow to mark the country’s victory over the Nazis. But the Russian leader’s Victory Day message to the nation on Tuesday was nearly identical to that of last year, as he cast the war in Ukraine as an existential battle against an aggressive, Russophobic and woke west. “Today, civilisation is again at a decisive turning point. A real war has been unleashed against us again,” Putin said as he delivered an angry yet somewhat routine speech in which he drew false parallels between today’s fight with Ukraine’s “criminal regime” and the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. Putin also recycled some of his other go-to grievances, blaming “western globalist elites” for “destroying the family” and “traditional values”. What was left unspoken by the Russian president was the battering his army had received over the last 12 months in Ukraine, the impact of which was revealed by the scaled-down military parade that followed his speech. It’s 4.20pm in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the day’s news so far: Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine that the “whole country is praying for them”, as he used his Victory Day speech to defend his invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the 78th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president drew historical parallels between the second world war and fighting in Ukraine “Today, civilisation is again at a decisive, turning point, a real war has been unleashed against us again,” Putin said in a speech that was laced with anger. “We are proud of the participants of the special military operation.

Russia may be building a water pipeline in an attempt to address a water shortage affecting the occupied city of Donetsk. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its daily update that water had been a growing issue for Donetsk since the invasion in February 2022. On 28 April, the Russian-installed head of Donetsk said regional supplies were running “dangerously low”. The Siversky-Donets canal that supplies the area is mainly under Ukrainian control, despite Russian attempts to take command of it. MEPs voted to speed up consideration of a law to boost ammunition production in Europe to the tune of €500m ($550m), due to efforts to supply Ukraine. The decision should see the new legislation – snappily termed the Act in Support of Ammunition Production (Asap) – in place by the end of the year, MEPs and European Commission officials said, Agence France-Presse reports.

The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Russia “will prevail” in its fight against what he described as “imperialists”, the state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday, in remarks seen to be aimed at Ukraine and its western supporters such as the US. North Korea has forged closer ties with the Kremlin and backed Moscow after it invaded Ukraine last year, including its proclamation later of having annexed parts of Ukraine, which most UN members condemned as illegal. The leaders of the G7 nations must condemn any threat to use nuclear weapons and vow “decisive action” against such a move when they hold a summit next week in the city of Hiroshima, Ukraine’s envoy to Japan said. Nuclear tension has surged since the start of the conflict with Ukraine as Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Russia is ready to use its nuclear arsenal if necessary to defend its “territorial integrity”. Russia may be building a water pipeline in an attempt to address a water shortage affecting the occupied city of Donetsk. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its daily update that water had been a growing issue for Donetsk since the invasion in February 2022. On 28 April, the Russian-installed head of Donetsk said regional supplies were running “dangerously low”. The Siversky-Donets canal that supplies the area is mainly under Ukrainian control, despite Russian attempts to take command of it. It runs near the city of Bakhmut, which has seen heavy fighting from both sides as Russia tries to take it. The MoD said: “Russia’s heavy use of indirect artillery to support the capture of Bakhmut … has likely inflicted collateral damage to the canal and other regional water infrastructure, undermining Russia’s efforts to remedy the lack of water that its invasion originally created. “To compensate for its lack of success in capture and retaining the canal, Russia is likely constructing a water pipeline to mitigate the water shortage within Donetsk city. However, this is unlikely to fully compensate for the occupied region’s reduced access to water.” Germany’s foreign minister has said China could play a decisive role in ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking alongside her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, at a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, Annalena Baerbock said that as a permanent member of the UN security council, China had the power to be influential in the conflict and bring it to an end. Her comments were rebuffed by Qin, who said China would neither “watch the fire from the other bank” nor “add fuel to the fire”. Baerbock said the EU was still working on ways to stop sanctions on Russian businesses and individuals being circumvented, including by using indirect companies in other countries. She was asked whether the measures would include a proposed blacklisting of several Chinese companies. In response she said negotiations were ongoing but that generally it was important to stop restrictions from being bypassed. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary force which is fighting Russia’s battle in Bakhmut, has said he was told that he and his mercenaries would be regarded as “traitors” if they abandoned their positions. Prigozhin threatened to withdraw his troops from the city in east Ukraine, which has been the site of a long-running battle since 2022 to try to capture it, because of a lack of ammunition. He since rowed back on it, but again threatened to do so unless he got it. His latest comments were released on Russia’s Victory Day, as a military parade took place in the capital, Moscow. He said: “A combat order came yesterday which clearly stated that if we leave our positions it will be regarded as treason against the motherland. That was the message to us. “[But] if there is no ammunition, then we will leave our positions and be the ones asking who is really betraying the motherland. Apparently, the one [betraying Russia] is the person who signed it [the order to supply too little ammunition].” He said his forces would stay in Bakhmut and keep insisting they get their ammo “for a few more days”. Prigozhin has previously accused the defence ministry of deliberately starving his forces of ammunition. The ministry has said it is working to ensure all battlefield units have what they need. Late on Monday, Prigozhin said there were signs the ammunition problem was being solved, but on Tuesday he said the size of the shipment had been slashed. “They’ve given us only 10% of what we asked for. We’ve been deceived,” he said. More details from Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s press conference alongside the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Kyiv on Tuesday. He was heavily critical of restrictions on the import of grain into the EU imposed after complaints by a group of five central and eastern European countries. He said the ban was helping Russia. He said: “All restrictions on our exports are completely unacceptable right now. They only reinforce the abilities of the aggressor. We are waiting for the EU to stop all restrictions as fast as possible.” Agence France-Presse said he called the measures “severe, even cruel” and “disappointing” in a time of war. The EU members involved – Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia – have sparred with Ukraine in recent weeks over the issue of grain. Russia’s invasion last year severely limited the traditional export channel of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea, necessitating export overland via Ukraine’s neighbours. Member states agreed to allow the import of certain products from Ukraine without quantitative restrictions, and without customs and official inspections. But farmers in some of the EU countries protested after a slump in prices, prompting a raft of restrictions and bans on Ukraine’s food exports in response. Brussels called the bans on imports of grain and other food from Ukraine “unacceptable” while Kyiv is at war with Russia. Last month, the European Commission reached an agreement with all the parties concerned to ensure the transit of Ukrainian grain exports through EU countries, but with restrictions. Speaking alongside Zelenskiy, Von der Leyen on Tuesday described the grain situation as “difficult”. “The immediate priority now is that the grain transit goes seamlessly and at the lowest possible cost outside from Ukraine towards the European Union,” she said. “This requires a very close cooperation of the different stakeholders. Therefore, we will jointly set up a coordination platform.” MEPs voted to speed up consideration of a law to boost ammunition production in Europe to the tune of €500m ($550m), due to efforts to supply Ukraine. The decision should see the new legislation – snappily termed the Act in Support of Ammunition Production (Asap) – in place by the end of the year, MEPs and European Commission officials said, Agence France-Presse reports. The spending proposal, initiated by the commission, comes as the bloc seeks to supply 1 million artillery shells to Ukraine over the next 12 months, adding to a stream of military deliveries. But shifting such quantities of munitions to Ukraine has severely depleted stocks in EU member countries’ arsenals, creating the need for the new ammunition-production act. The Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, in a joint news conference in Kyiv with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Asap law would “help member states to ramp up the production … and speed up the delivery of ammunition to meet Ukraine’s and member states’ needs”. The draft legislation calls for tapping the EU’s European defence fund and another mechanism the commission has suggested creating under a July 2022 proposal, called the European Defence Industrial Reinforcement Through Common Procurement Act. In a first, Ukraine has received Israeli-made radar defence systems, which have already been deployed in Kyiv as of Monday, according to Israeli media reports. A Lithuanian volunteer organisation known as Blue/Yellow delivered 16 ieMHR models made by Israel’s RADA Electronic Industries last week and three are already in use in the Ukrainian capital, the Israeli daily Ha’aretz said. The systems are designed to detect aerial threats including missiles, rockets, mortar shells, helicopters and drones within up to a 10km (6.2-mile) radius. The models function as an alert system, and do not have interception capabilities. According to the Blue/Yellow group, the mobile and stationary systems will be used mainly to protect critical installations and infrastructure. Israel has provided millions in humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the invasion began last February. However, wary of the need to maintain relations with Russia – which facilitates Israeli operations against Iranian-backed actors in Syria – it had refrained from sending military materiel despite repeated requests from Kyiv and Washington. The Russian deployment of Iranian-made drones, however, appears to have toughened Israel’s position. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was reelected in November, had also pledged to reassess the country’s stance on the war. Israel has offered to assist Kyiv in creating a “life-saving civilian early-warning system” to protect against aerial attack and has reportedly shared intelligence on Iran’s drone programme. Export licences for two Israeli companies to sell defence systems with a 40km range were approved in March, Israel’s Walla news site reported, citing three Israeli and Ukranian officials. Previous Russian Victory Day military parades have seen a fleet of tanks processing through Moscow’s Red Square in a show of military strength. In contrast on Tuesday, only one was on show, a T-34 Soviet-era tank. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he discussed European integration, defence matters and sanctions against Russia at a meeting with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Kyiv. He said he expected the EU to soon approve more sanctions on Russia. He also expected the EU to remove trade restrictions on grain imports from Ukraine, after the trading bloc put measures in place after complaints from Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Bulgaria. Zelenskiy told reporters the moves were “harsh” and “protectionist”. He added that he expected a “positive appraisal” of Ukraine joining the EU at its summit in June, and he thanked European countries for the promise of 1m artillery shells. Ukraine is planning a “very important” counteroffensive against Russian forces that must “demonstrate success”, the country’s prime minister has said. Denys Shmyhal told Sky News that the operation would be launched when the time was right. Sky reported: Mr Shmyhal visited a British military training area on Salisbury Plain to watch British and New Zealand troops helping to train Ukrainian recruits as part of a British-led assistance programme to turn thousands of Ukrainian civilians into soldiers. Asked whether some of the recruits learning shooting and other skills would be part of the counter-offensive when they returned to Ukraine, the prime minister, speaking in English, said: “On this training base, our future soldiers – guys and girls – are … having all special knowledge and experiences, practical experiences, for the battlefield.” As for why it was taking so long for the Ukrainian military officially to begin its offensive, Mr Shmyhal said: “We are preparing very carefully because it’s a very important operation and we understand that we should demonstrate success in this operation to our society, to our partners, to all the world [and] to our enemy.” The EU must not be intimidated by Moscow’s showcasing of military power but continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Tuesday as Russia marked Victory Day with a parade. “Two thousand two hundred kilometres north-east from here, Putin is parading his soldiers, tanks and missiles today,” Scholz told lawmakers in a speech at the European parliament in Strasbourg. “We must not be intimidated by such power plays. Let’s remain steadfast in our support for Ukraine – for as long as it takes.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said there is currently no prospect of peace between Russia and Ukraine because “both sides are convinced that they can win”. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El País on Tuesday, Guterres was pessimistic about the EU and the UN’s ability to broker an end to the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion last year. “Unfortunately, I don’t think peace negotiations are possible at the moment,” he said. “Both sides are convinced they can win. This was a Russian invasion that was against international law and against the United Nations charter, but I don’t see Russia being willing to pull out of the territories it’s occupying at the moment and I think Ukraine is hoping to retake them.” Guterres said the UN was instead doing what it could “to have a dialogue with both sides to solve concrete problems”, such as Ukrainian grain exports and Russian food and fertiliser exports. The secretary general played down hopes of Chinese or Brazilian mediation to bring about an end to hostilities. “I’ve already said that peace negotiations aren’t going to happen at the moment,” he said. “But I hope they will in the future. There was talk of a Russian winter offensive and a Ukrainian one in the spring; it’s clear that both sides are completely involved in the war.” Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine that the “whole country is praying for them”, as he used his Victory Day speech to defend his invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the 78th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president drew historical parallels between the second world war and fighting in Ukraine “Today, civilisation is again at a decisive, turning point, a real war has been unleashed against us again,” Putin said in a speech that was laced with anger. “We are proud of the participants of the special military operation. The future of our people depends on you,” he said. Putin accused the west of “destroying traditional values” and propagandising a “system of robbery and violence.” “The goal of our enemies, and there is nothing new here, is to achieve the disintegration and destruction of our country,” he said. More than 500 Russian soldiers who fought in Ukraine were present at the parade, according to state media. Six leaders of former Soviet states were also present. In a surprise move on Monday, the heads of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Armenia – three post-Soviet countries that Moscow strives to keep in its orbit – announced that they would attend the military parade on Red Square alongside Putin. “Here is to our victory!,” Putin exclaimed before returning to his seat. Vladimir Putin said a “real war” was again being waged against Russia, as he invoked the Soviet Union’s victory in the second world war to say the west was trying to destroy his country. In a speech on Red Square as part of Russia’s Victory Day celebrations, Putin said Russia wanted to see a peaceful future, and said the entire country was behind what Russia calls the “special military operation” in Ukraine. Putin said the west had forgotten the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. Vladimir Putin has started his speech as part of Russia’s Victory Day celebrations in Moscow this morning. The president walked from the Kremlin to Red Square to be greeted by massed ranks of military personnel on Tuesday as the start of a Victory Day celebrations to mark the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. Victory Day is one of the most important public holidays in Russia, when people commemorate the huge sacrifices made by the Soviet Union during what is called the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45, in which about 27 million citizens died. This anniversary is even more emotionally charged as Russia mourns thousands of soldiers killed in the nearly 15-month war in Ukraine, which shows no sign of ending. Here are some images from Russia’s Victory Day parade in Moscow today. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Russia “will prevail” in its fight against what he described as “imperialists”, the state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday, in remarks seen to be aimed at Ukraine and its western supporters such as the US. North Korea has forged closer ties with the Kremlin and backed Moscow after it invaded Ukraine last year, including its proclamation later of having annexed parts of Ukraine, which most UN members condemned as illegal. “We send warm wishes to you, the Russian army and the people of Russia for their holy fight to preserve world peace,” the agency quoted Kim as telling Vladimir Putin in a letter. Kim also congratulated Putin on Tuesday’s Victory Day anniversary that celebrates the 1945 defeat of Nazi Germany, saying Russia would continue to protect its “autonomy” and the “stability of the region”. The leaders of the G7 nations must condemn any threat to use nuclear weapons and vow “decisive action” against such a move when they hold a summit next week in the city of Hiroshima, Ukraine’s envoy to Japan said. Nuclear tension has surged since the start of the conflict with Ukraine as Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Russia is ready to use its nuclear arsenal if necessary to defend its “territorial integrity”. Sergiy Korsunsky also told Reuters that conditions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had deteriorated rapidly, a situation the head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog warned at the weekend had become “potentially dangerous”. “It should be a very clear statement from specifically those nuclear powers among the G7 that the use of nuclear weapons or nuclear terrorism will not be tolerated and will be met with almost decisive actions from major powers,” he said. The envoy’s comments came as Russia launched drone, missile and airstrikes on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and other cities in the run-up to its cherished Victory Day holiday today that celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will attend by video link the G7 gathering from 19-21 May in Hiroshima, which in 1945 became the first city to be hit by an atomic bomb, adding significance to his country’s message. “It’s most important that the summit, when we have a real threat of nuclear terrorism, that summit will be in Hiroshima,” Korsunsky added. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has arrived in Kyiv, where she will meet Zelenskiy. Ukraine will be celebrating “Europe Day” along with the countries of the European Union it hopes to join. This year’s Victory Day in Russia is emotionally charged, Reuters reports, as the country mourns thousands of soldiers killed in the nearly 15-month war in Ukraine that shows no sign of ending. Russia is also reeling from drone attacks, including one on the Kremlin on 3 May that it said was an attempt to assassinate Vladimir Putin. Ukraine denies involvement. Putin has repeatedly likened the Ukraine war – which he casts as a battle against Nazi-inspired nationalists – to the challenge the Soviet Union faced when Hitler invaded in 1941. Ukraine says this is absurd and accuses Russia of behaving like Nazi Germany by waging an unprovoked war of aggression and seizing Ukrainian territory. There have been reports of fewer soldiers and less military hardware joining this year’s parade as the Ukraine conflict takes a heavy toll on men and equipment. Authorities nationwide have cancelled the “Immortal Regiment” processions, where people carry portraits of relatives who fought against the Nazis. Dame Melinda Simmons has posted a photograph of dawn in Kyiv this morning, after another night of air raid sirens and sheltering. “I guess one advantage of an early morning air raid is the chance to see this,” she wrote. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has condemned this morning’s attack, saying in a tweet: “Ukraine, Europe, and the United States commemorated victory over tyranny yesterday. Russia marks May 9 with more missiles and drones launched toward Ukrainian cities and sleeping civilians.” Ukraine’s armed forces have just said in their update that 25 missiles were launched by Russia across Ukraine overnight, with 23 of those shot down. Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv’s city military administration, said that according to preliminary information there were no casualties in the attack that was carried out with cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea region. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said debris fell on a house in the Holosiivskyi district in the south-west of Kyiv, but there were no casualties and not much damage. In the often-targeted Shevchenkivskyi district of central Kyiv, debris was found on a road, Reuters reports. “Kyiv stood up again and will stand up in the future!” Popko said. Russia launched about 15 cruise missiles at Ukraine’s capital on Tuesday, the second attack in as many days, with air defence systems shooting all of them down, officials said, after air raid alerts blared over most of the country. “As at the front, the plans of the aggressor failed,” Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv’s city military administration, said in comments posted on the Telegram messaging app. Tuesday’s attacks came a day after Russia launched its biggest drone swarm yet in a renewed air campaign unleashed 10 days ago after a lull since early March, Reuters reports. It also came on Russia’s Victory Day, one its most commemorated public holidays, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. “[They] try to kill as many civilians as possible – on this day,” Popko said. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Russia launched 15 cruise missiles at Ukraine’s capital on Tuesday, the second attack in as many days, with air defence systems shooting all of them down, officials said, after air raid alerts blared over most of the country. “As at the front, the plans of the aggressor failed,” Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv’s city military administration, said in comments posted on the Telegram messaging app. Tuesday’s attacks came on Russia’s Victory Day, one its most commemorated public holidays, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. “[They] try to kill as many civilians as possible – on this day,” Popko said. Here are the other key recent developments in the war: A Russian missile strike overnight on Monday destroyed a Red Cross warehouse containing aid in Odesa. The Odesa regional organisation of the Red Cross society said workers and volunteers were not in the 1,000 sq metre unit at the time. “The provision of humanitarian aid and the activities of some projects of the Odesa Regional Organisation of the Red Cross of Ukraine have been suspended,” the statement added. On Monday at least five people were wounded by Russian strikes on Kyiv, city officials said, as Moscow launched another large-scale attack on Ukraine. Kyiv’s mayor said Russia fired 60 Iranian-made kamikaze drones early on Monday, including 36 at Kyiv, all of which had been shot down. However, debris hit apartments and other buildings, injuring at least five people. Russia has in effect stopped the Black Sea grain deal, which expires on 18 May, by refusing to register incoming vessels, Ukraine’s reconstruction ministry said. Moscow has threatened to quit the agreement, which is meant to help ease a global food crisis. About 100,000 Russian soldiers have died in the battle to capture Bakhmut, a Ukrainian general has claimed. Col Serhiy Cherevaty, the spokesperson for the eastern group of the armed forces of Ukraine, told Ukrainian TV they were “rough calculations”. He said: “I am sure that further verification will only show an increase in this number. This is natural as the enemy uses the so-called meat assaults as the main method of waging war.” Russia’s Wagner mercenary group appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut, saying they had been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged eastern Ukrainian city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Russia’s Victory Day on Tuesday. Russian investigators have charged a man with terrorism offences after a car bombing wounded a prominent Russian nationalist writer. The explosion in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia, on Saturday, broke both legs of Zakhar Prilepin, an ardent supporter of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. A close associate who was in the car with him was killed. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv on Tuesday, the European Commission announced. The EU could impose penalties on countries helping Moscow dodge western sanctions as part of a drive to close loopholes in the regime of restrictions on the Russian economy. A draft EU regulation seen by the Guardian proposes that non-EU countries could be included in future sanctions if shown to be at “particularly high risk of being used for circumvention against Russia”. A total of 1,679 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a Moscow-installed official in the Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the past three years, according to UK intelligence. The EU’s executive has proposed blacklisting several Chinese companies and curbing exports to nations seen as involved in bypassing Russia trade restrictions under new sanctions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-at-least-17-killed-in-attack-on-housing-in-zaporizhzhia","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-09T20:11:17Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Putin calls Crimea bridge attack an ‘act of terrorism’ — as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-at-least-17-killed-in-attack-on-housing-in-zaporizhzhia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-at-least-17-killed-in-attack-on-housing-in-zaporizhzhia","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Putin calls Crimea bridge attack an ‘act of terrorism’ — as it happened","bodyText":"We’re closing this liveblog now. You can read all our Ukraine coverage here. Thanks. It’s nearly 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: The Russian invasion of Ukraine, now in its eighth month, is being accompanied by the destruction and pillaging of historical sites and treasures on an industrial scale, Ukrainian authorities say. In an interview with The Associated Press, Ukraine’s culture minister alleged that Russian soldiers helped themselves to artifacts in almost 40 Ukrainian museums. Austria’s ministry of foreign affairs has condemned Russia’s recent attacks in Zaporizhzhia that has killed at least 13 people. The ministry called the attacks “utterly unacceptable and must stop,” adding that “those responsible must be held to account.” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US president Joe Biden spoke by phone on Sunday and agreed the Kremlin’s latest nuclear threats were “irresponsible” and its partial mobilization “a serious mistake”, according to a German government statement, Reuters reports. The nearly one-hour telephone call was focused on preparations for the upcoming G7 and G20 meetings that will address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the consequences, the statement said. Russia’s FSB security service said on Sunday it had seen a “considerable increase” in Ukrainian fire into its territory in recent days, claiming one person had been killed and five wounded over the past week. Since the start of October, the number of attacks from Ukrainian armed formations on Russia’s border territory has considerably increased,” said the FSB, which is responsible for border security. A Russian drone killed a civilian in Sumy oblast on Sunday, Euromaidan has reported. According to the deputy head of the office of the president of Ukraine, the victim was standing next to a store in the Myronivska community. The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that a power line that was cut yesterday by shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been restored. Ukraine’s national police said on Sunday that authorities had exhumed the first 20 bodies from makeshift graves in the recently liberated city of Lyman, in the eastern Donetsk region. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, now in its eighth month, is being accompanied by the destruction and pillaging of historical sites and treasures on an industrial scale, Ukrainian authorities say. Associated Press reports: In an interview with The Associated Press, Ukraine’s culture minister alleged that Russian soldiers helped themselves to artifacts in almost 40 Ukrainian museums. The looting and destruction of cultural sites has caused losses estimated in the hundreds of millions of euros (dollars), the minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, added. “The attitude of Russians toward Ukrainian culture heritage is a war crime,” he said. For the moment, Ukraine’s government and its Western backers supplying weapons are mostly focused on defeating Russia on the battlefield. But if and when peace returns, the preservation of Ukrainian collections of art, history and culture also will be vital, so survivors of the war can begin the next fight: rebuilding their lives. “These are museums, historical buildings, churches. Everything that was built and created by generations of Ukrainians,” Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, said in September when she visited a Ukrainian museum in New York. “This is a war against our identity.” Austria’s ministry of foreign affairs has condemned Russia’s recent attacks in Zaporizhzhia that has killed at least 13 people. The ministry called the attacks “utterly unacceptable and must stop,” adding that “those responsible must be held to account.” The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the US president, Joe Biden, spoke by phone on Sunday and agreed the Kremlin’s latest nuclear threats were “irresponsible” and its part mobilisation “a serious mistake”, according to a German government statement, Reuters reports. The nearly one-hour telephone call was focused on preparations for the upcoming G7 and G20 meetings, which will address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the consequences, the statement said. The two leaders agreed never to accept Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory, calling it a further escalation, the statement said. They agreed that Russia’s part mobilisation showed the “bitter price” Russians were having to pay for the miscalculations of Vladimir Putin. “They criticised the latest nuclear threats of Moscow as irresponsible and agreed such a step would have exceptionally serious consequences for Russia,” the statement said. On the topic of the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, the two leaders agreed the sabotage of critical infrastructure would be dealt with decisively, it said. A White House statement reaffirmed the talks between Scholz and Biden, saying: The leaders reiterated their condemnation of Russia’s attempted annexation of Ukrainian territory, as well as their ongoing commitment to hold Russia accountable for its brutal actions and provide security and economic assistance to Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said the explosion on a key bridge linking Crimea and the Russian mainland was a terrorist act planned by the Ukrainian special services. In a video address on the Kremlin’s Telegram channel on Sunday, Putin said: “There is no doubt. This is an act of terrorism aimed at destroying critically important civilian infrastructure … This was devised, carried out and ordered by the Ukrainian special services.” Putin was meeting Alexander Bastrykin, the head of Russia’s investigative committee, who was presenting findings of an inquiry into Saturday’s explosion and fire on the Kerch bridge. Russia’s FSB security service said on Sunday it had seen a “considerable increase” in Ukrainian fire into its territory in recent days, claiming one person had been killed and five wounded over the past week. Agence France-Presse reports: Since the start of October, the number of attacks from Ukrainian armed formations on Russia’s border territory has considerably increased,” said the FSB, which is responsible for border security. The attacks have concentrated on the Russian region of Belgorod, near the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, as well as Bryansk and Kursk, the FSB said. It said that in the past week “more than 100 bombardments were recorded in 32 localities, with the use of multiple rocket launchers, artillery, mortars and drones”. A child was among those wounded, the FSB said, adding that the attacks also “destroyed two electricity stations, 11 residential buildings and two administrative buildings”. A Russian drone killed a civilian in Sumy oblast on Sunday, Euromaidan has reported. According to the deputy head of the office of the president of Ukraine, the victim was standing next to a store in the Myronivska community. The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that a power line that was cut yesterday by shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been restored. Ukraine’s national police said on Sunday that authorities had exhumed the first 20 bodies from makeshift graves in the recently liberated city of Lyman, in the eastern Donetsk region. It is coming up to 6.30pm in Kyiv. Here is what you might have missed: The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will hold a meeting of his security council on Monday, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said. It comes after an explosion on Saturday caused the collapse of part of a bridge linking the Crimean peninsula with Russia. Ukrainian authorities have revised the death toll from the Russian shelling of the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia down from 17 to at least 12. The blasts blew out windows in adjacent buildings and left at least one high-rise apartment building partly collapsed. In the immediate aftermath of the strikes, the city council said 17 were killed but later revised that down to 12. The city council secretary, Anatoliy Kurtev, said rockets struck the city overnight, and that at least 20 private homes and 50 apartment buildings had been damaged. At least 40 people were admitted to hospital and dozens more were being treated for moderate to light injuries, Kurtev posted on his Telegram channel. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has vowed that those who ordered and carried out the “merciless” strikes on Zaporizhzhia will be held responsible. In a post on his Facebook page, he said the attack was “evil” and that everyone involved in the incident “will be held accountable”. The blasts that killed at least 12 people in Zaporizhzhia came from six missiles launched in Russian-occupied areas of the wider region, the Ukrainian air force has said. The Zaporizhzhia region is one of four that Russia claimed as its own this month, but the regional capital remains under Ukrainian control. Reuters reports that the White House said it would continue to arm Ukraine but declined to make a direct comment on an explosion that damaged Russia’s road-and-rail bridge to Crimea. The Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told ABC’s This Week programme: “We don’t really have anything more to add to the reports about the explosion on the bridge. What I can tell you is that Mr Putin started this war, and Mr Putin could end it today, simply by moving his troops out of the country.” The Russian invasion of Ukraine is being accompanied by the destruction and pillaging of historical sites and treasures on an industrial scale, Ukrainian authorities have said. In an interview with the Associated Press, Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, alleged that Russian soldiers helped themselves to artefacts in almost 40 Ukrainian museums. The looting and destruction of cultural sites has caused losses estimated in the hundreds of millions of euros, the minister added. Ukraine has recaptured more than 1,170 sq km (450 sq miles) of land in its southern Kherson region since launching the start of its counter-assault against Russia in late August, a military spokesperson said. Ukraine achieved success with its offensive in the north-east, but its drive in the south to wipe out a Russian foothold on the west bank of the vast Dnipro river has taken longer, Reuters reports. Southern military command spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk said Ukraine was making progress on the Kherson front, but that a lot needed to be done to secure newly recaptured territories. The damage from Saturday’s explosion on the Kerch bridge in Crimea could have a “significant” impact on Russia’s “already strained ability to sustain its forces” in southern Ukraine, the latest UK intelligence update said. The Ministry of Defence said the blast “will likely touch President Putin closely” for reasons including that it came hours after his 70th birthday; that he personally sponsored and opened the bridge; and that its construction contractor was a childhood friend. The ministry said the bridge’s rail crossing had played a key role in moving heavy military vehicles to the southern front during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian divers were due on Sunday to examine the extent of damage from the blast on the Kerch bridge linking Crimea to Russia. Russian news agencies quoted the deputy prime minister, Marat Khusnullin, as saying the divers would start work on Sunday at 6am (3am GMT), with a more detailed survey above the waterline expected to be completed by the end of the day.

Southern military command spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk said that Ukraine was making progress on the Kherson front, but that a lot needed to be done to secure newly recaptured territories. She said on Ukrainian television: Work is continuing on consolidation of territory, clearing it and conducting stabilising operations, as the settlements we enter contain many surprises left by the (Russian) occupiers As of today, from the beginning of the counter-offensive, over 1,170 sq km have been liberated in the Kherson direction. Ukrainian officials have long talked up the priority of recapturing Kherson, a flat, agricultural region which Moscow captured in its near-entirety in the early days of its invasion. Reuters reports that the White House said it would continue to arm Ukraine but declined direct comment on an explosion that damaged Russia’s road-and-rail bridge to Crimea. National security spokesman John Kirby told ABC’s This Week programme: We don’t really have anything more to add to the reports about the explosion on the bridge. What I can tell you is that Mr Putin started this war, and Mr Putin could end it today, simply by moving his troops out of the country. Kirby said both sides needed to find a way to negotiate an end to the war but that Putin had shown no interest in doing so. He added: Quite the contrary. By calling up hundreds of thousands of reservists, by politically annexing, or at least trying to annex four areas of Ukraine, he has shown every indication that he is doubling down. This, said Kirby, “is why, quite frankly, we are in touch almost daily with the Ukrainians and we’re going to continue to provide them security assistance.” These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. Nicole Stybnarova, a lecturer in public international law at the University of Oxford, has written for us to argue that Putin’s war is illegal – and Russians fleeing the draft may have the right to asylum: Russian software architect “AA” was one of 17,000 people who fled Russia for Finland last weekend. This was before Finland closed its border with Russia, which was the last direct route from Russia to the European Union. AA told Finnish journalists that Russia was establishing “call-up centres or contact points” on the other side of the border, preventing people from leaving and funnelling them into the armed forces. Apparently, no authority on either side of the borders between Russia and the EU is now interested in the fate of ordinary Russians who refuse to fight in the criminal invasion of Ukraine. Read more: Putin’s war is illegal – and Russians fleeing the draft may have the right to asylum Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs has provided an update on Russian losses in the war. According to the government department, 62,500 Russian soldiers have been killed and 5,133 armoured personnel vehicles destroyed or captured. Vladimir Putin’s forces have also lost 1,477 artillery systems, 266 aircraft, 235 helicopters and 2,486 tanks. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify these numbers. The blasts that killed at least 17 people in Zaporizhzhia came from six missiles launched in Russian-occupied areas of the wider region, the Ukrainian air force has said. The Zaporizhzhia region is one of four Russia claimed as its own this month, but the regional capital remains under Ukrainian control. Emma Graham-Harrison and Charlotte Higgins report for us in Lviv: In a time of violence, warfare and bloodshed, what is the use of literature? This was a question addressed at the Lviv BookForum, a three-day literary festival in the Ukrainian city, staged despite – and in defiance of – the Russian invasion. The festival has brought together Ukrainian, British and international authors including human rights lawyer Philippe Sands, whose bestselling book, East West Street, is largely set in 20th-century Lviv. Ukrainian writer Oleksandr Mykhed told audiences that at the moment of the invasion, he realised: “You could not protect your family from a rifle with your poems. You could not hit someone with a book, you could try but it won’t work with the crazy occupiers from Moscow.

Peter Beaumont reports for us from Kyiv: At least 17 people have been killed by Russian shelling of a residential area in Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, a region that the Kremlin illegally claims to have annexed despite not controlling all of it. The overnight attack happened in the aftermath of a devastating explosion on the key bridge linking Russian-occupied Crimea to the Russian mainland, a prestige project of the president, Vladimir Putin. The blast seriously damaged the 12-mile-long (19km) structure, which serves as an important military supply route. The Zaporizhzhia strike came as Ukrainians – jubilant over the damage to the Kerch bridge, a hated symbol of Putin’s ambitions – were bracing for a major retaliation by Moscow, which had warned Kyiv against targeting the structure. Read more: Ukraine: at least 17 killed in attack on housing in Zaporizhzhia The Russian invasion of Ukraine is being accompanied by the destruction and pillaging of historical sites and treasures on an industrial scale, Ukrainian authorities said. In an interview with the Associated Press (AP), Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, alleged that Russian soldiers helped themselves to artefacts in almost 40 Ukrainian museums. The looting and destruction of cultural sites has caused losses estimated in the hundreds of millions of euros, the minister added. He said: The attitude of Russians toward Ukrainian culture heritage is a war crime. Mariupol’s exiled city council said Russian forces pilfered more than 2,000 items from the city’s museums. Among the most precious items were ancient religious icons, a unique handwritten Torah scroll, a 200-year-old bible and more than 200 medals, the council said. Also looted were artworks by painters Arkhip Kuindzhi, who was born in Mariupol, and Crimea-born Ivan Aivazovsky, both famed for their seascapes, the exiled councillors said. The UN’s cultural agency is keeping a tally of sites being struck by missiles, bombs and shelling. With the war now in its eighth month, the agency says it has verified damage to 199 sites in 12 regions. They include 84 churches and other religious sites, 37 buildings of historic importance, 37 buildings for cultural activities, 18 monuments, 13 museums and 10 libraries, Unesco said. The time is just past 1pm in Kyiv. Here is what you might have missed: Shelling in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia has killed at least 17 people, city official Anatoliy Kurtev has said. Anton Gerashchenko, a senior presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said preliminary figures suggested 17 dead and 40 wounded after an attack on residential housing. “The Russians are not able to respond on the battlefield and therefore hit the cities in the rear,” he said. The city lies 125km (80 miles) from the Russian-held nuclear power plant that is Europe’s largest. Zelenskiy has vowed that those who ordered and issued the “merciless” strikes in Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia will be held responsible. In a post on his Facebook page, he said the attack was “evil” and that everyone involved in the incident “will be held accountable”. The damage from Saturday’s explosion on the Kerch bridge in Crimea could have a “significant” impact on Russia’s “already strained ability to sustain its forces” in southern Ukraine, the latest UK intelligence update says. The Ministry of Defence said the blast “will likely touch President Putin closely” for reasons including that it came hours after his 70th birthday, he personally sponsored and opened the bridge, and its construction contractor was a childhood friend. The ministry said the bridge’s rail crossing had played a key role in moving heavy military vehicles to the southern front during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian divers will on Sunday examine the extent of damage from the blast on the Kerch bridge linking Crimea to Russia. Russian news agencies quoted the deputy prime minister, Marat Khusnullin, as saying the divers would start work on Sunday at 6am (0300 GMT), with a more detailed survey above the waterline expected to be complete by the end of the day. Vladimir Putin signed a decree late on Saturday tightening security for the Kerch bridge and for energy infrastructure between Crimea and Russia after the explosion that crippled the heavily guarded bridge. Russia’s federal security service, the FSB, is in charge of the effort. By Saturday evening, Russia said the rail link across the bridge was operational again but road traffic would remain constricted. An adviser to Zelenskiy said the explosion on the Kerch bridge was just “the beginning”. Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter: “Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything that is stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled.” Three people were killed on Saturday after a truck bomb caused a fire and the collapse of a section of the bridge, Russian officials said. Russian troops fighting in the Mykolaiv, Kryvyi Rih and Zaporizhzhia regions of southern Ukraine could receive all the supplies they needed via existing land and sea corridors, said Russia’s defence ministry after the Kerch bridge explosion. The road-and-rail bridge has been used to take Russian personnel and military supplies through the peninsula into other parts of Ukraine’s south. The parliamentary leader of Zelenskiy’s party has stopped short of claiming Kyiv was responsible for the Kerch bridge blast but appeared to cast it as a consequence of Moscow’s takeover of Crimea and attempts to integrate the peninsula with the Russian mainland. “Russian illegal construction is starting to fall apart and catch fire,” David Arakhamia wrote on Telegram. “The reason is simple: if you build something explosive, then sooner or later it will explode.” Russia has named a new senior commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. Sergei Surovikin is a notorious general who opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in the 1990s. He led the Russian military expedition in Syria in 2017, where he was accused of using “controversial” tactics including indiscriminate bombing against anti-government fighters. Zelenskiy said Ukrainian troops were involved in “very tough fighting” near Bakhmut, a strategically important eastern town Russia is trying to take. Reuters reported that while Ukrainian troops had recaptured thousands of square kilometres of land in recent offensives in the east and south, officials say progress is likely to slow once Kyiv’s forces meet more determined resistance. Zelenskiy said in his nightly address: “We are holding our positions in the Donbas, in particular in the Bakhmut direction, where it is very, very difficult now – very tough fighting.” Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom, said the diesel generators at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had only a limited supply of fuel. Overnight shelling cut power to the plant, which needs cooling to avoid a meltdown, forcing it to switch to emergency generators. The United Natoins atomic watchdog has renewed calls for a protection zone at the plant, condemning the shelling as “tremendously irresponsible”. Ukraine’s GDP has shrunk by 30% in nine months, the ministry of economy said on Saturday. “Among the negative factors that affected the economy, the weather and the actions of the occupiers stand out,” it said. France’s prestigious Bayeux War Correspondents’ Awards on Saturday largely honoured reporting on the Ukraine conflict, with Associated Press and Burkina Faso newspaper Sidwaya among the recipients. The photo prize went to Ukrainian photographer Evgeniy Maloletka for his work with video journalist Mstyslav Chernov on the fall of Mariupol for AP. The series of explosions that rocked Kharkiv early on Saturday sparked a fire at one of the city’s medical institutions, the mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city said. Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram that the explosions were the result of missile strikes in the city centre, Associated Press reported. They also sparked a fire in a non-residential building. The German defence minister has told Nato it must do more to bolster security, warning: “We cannot know how far Putin’s delusions of grandeur can go.” Christine Lambrecht said Germany had heard of Russian threats to Lithuania for implementing EU sanctions and that they must be taken seriously and be prepared, Reuters reported. The UK has rejected Moscow’s call for a secret ballot in the UN general assembly next week on whether to condemn Russia’s move to annex four regions in Ukraine and requested that the 193-member body vote publicly. The general assembly is set to vote on a draft resolution that would condemn Russia’s “illegal so-called referenda” and the “attempted illegal annexation”. The latest pictures from the Russian shelling of housing in Zaporizhzhia that has reportedly killed at least 17 people. Slovakia’s defence minister, Yaroslav Nad, has tweeted that two Zuzana howitzers have been sent to Ukraine. He said: To celebrate his 70th birthday, we gave the aggressor Putin another gift. Two more new Zuzana 2 howitzers are already in Ukraine (and much more to come). Andrew Roth reports for us from Moscow: Russia has appointed a notorious general who opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in the 1990s as its first overall commander for the war in Ukraine, as the Kremlin struggles to halt a Ukrainian counteroffensive that has left its forces in disarray. The appointment of Gen Sergei Surovikin came on the same day as Vladimir Putin was dealt a humiliating blow after an explosion on the Kerch bridge sank a section of the motorway into the Kerch Strait and caused a major fire on the railway. Surovikin is a veteran commander who led the Russian military expedition in Syria in 2017, where he was accused of using “controversial” tactics including indiscriminate bombing against anti-government fighters.

The tweet adds that if Ukrainian military forces “had modern anti-missile systems, we could have prevented such tragedies”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has vowed that those who ordered and issued the “merciless” strikes in Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia will be held responsible. In a post on his Facebook page, he said: Zaporozhye again. Again merciless strikes on civilians. In residential buildings, just in the middle of the night. There are already 12 dead. 49 injured in hospital, 6 of them children. The absolute meanness of all. Absolute evil. Inhumans and terrorists. From the one who gave this order, and to all who followed this order. They will be held accountable. A must. Before the law and before the people. Peter Beaumont in Kyiv and Pjotr Sauer report: As a chilly autumn dawn broke on Saturday over the Kerch bridge linking Russia-occupied Crimea to the mainland, the road traffic was light. With the sky turning pink, a few cars and several lorries were making their way across the bridge, which is about 12 miles (19km) long and before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was used by 15,000 cars a day, A little way distant and above the cars, a long cargo train carrying tankers of fuel among its wagons was also making its way towards the peninsula across the parallel railway bridge. The blast, when it came at 6.07am (3.07 GMT), was devastating. CCTV footage posted on Russian Telegram channels showed a car and a lorry moving almost together when a vast fireball engulfed them, orange mixed with a storm of white-hot fragments swirling around the span.

The Kerch bridge, a hated symbol of the Kremlin’s occupation of the southern Ukrainian peninsula, was built in 2018. Footage shared on Russian Telegram channels and news agencies appeared to show the moment of the explosion with two vehicles, a truck and a car, at the centre of the blast, although it was unclear whether either was responsible or simply caught up in the detonation At least 12 people were killed and 49 hospitalised, including six children, as a result of the shelling in the city of Zaporizhzhia, the region’s governor says. A nine-storey building was partially destroyed overnight, five other residential buildings levelled and many more damaged in 12 Russian missile attacks on the city in south-east Ukraine, Reuters quoted Oleksandr Starukh as saying. The governor said on Telegram: There may be more people under the rubble. A rescue operation is under way at the scene. Eight people have already been rescued. City official Anatoliy Kurtev had said earlier that at least 17 people were killed when missiles hit a high-rise apartment complex and buildings. Russian divers will on Sunday examine the extent of damage from the blast on the Kerch bridge linking Crimea to Russia. Russian news agencies quoted the deputy prime minister, Marat Khusnullin, as saying the divers would start work on Sunday at 6am (0300 GMT), with a more detailed survey above the waterline expected to be complete by the end of the day. The work came as the Kremlin-installed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said: Of course, emotions have been triggered and there is a healthy desire to seek revenge. Peter Beaumont in Kyiv has the full story: The damage from Saturday’s explosion on the Kerch bridge in Crimea could have a “significant” impact on Russia’s “already strained ability to sustain its forces” in southern Ukraine, the latest UK intelligence update says. The Ministry of Defence said the blast “will likely touch President Putin closely” for reasons including that it came hours after his 70th birthday, he personally sponsored and opened the bridge, and its construction contractor was a childhood friend. The ministry said the bridge’s rail crossing had played a key role in moving heavy military vehicles to the southern front during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The extent of damage to the rail crossing was uncertain, it said, but any serious disruption to its capacity would be “highly likely” to significantly affect Russian forces in Ukraine’s south. Some officials in Moscow and in Russian-occupied Ukraine have called for retaliation over the explosion that heavily damaged the Kerch bridge linking Crimea and Russia on Saturday. “There is an undisguised terrorist war against us,” Russian ruling party deputy Oleg Morozov told the RIA Novosti news agency. Agence France-Presse quoted a Russian-installed official in the occupied Ukrainian Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, as saying: Everyone is waiting for a retaliatory strike and it is likely to come. Military analysts said the blast could have a major impact if Moscow saw the need to shift already hard-pressed troops to the Crimea from other regions or if it prompted a rush by residents to leave. Mick Ryan, a retired Australian major general now with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that even if Ukrainians were not behind the blast, it constituted “a massive influence operation win for Ukraine”. He said on Twitter: It is a demonstration to Russians, and the rest of the world, that Russia’s military cannot protect any of the provinces it recently annexed. Shelling in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia has killed at least 17 people, city official Anatoliy Kurtev has said.

Next to a pockmarked bus stop was debris left behind by Vladimir Putin’s army: machine-gun bullets, cigarette packets and an empty tin of tuna. “It was a difficult time. People are worried the Russians might come back,” Davidenko said. He added: “I talked to the Russian soldiers as they drove past. They were young guys from Siberia. They asked me: ‘Batya [Dad], how are you living?’ I answered: ‘We are fine here, thanks very much.’” Russian forces trundled into the Chernobyl exclusion zone on 24 February in the early hours of the invasion. According to Davidenko, they crossed over the Pripyat River from Belarus using a pontoon bridge. They then headed towards the Chernobyl nuclear power station, covered with a giant sarcophagus, the scene of the disastrous 1986 accident. By breakfast time they had seized the station. Russian troops disarmed the 169 Ukrainian national guards based at the plant and rounded up its technical staff, 103 people. They established a command centre and began digging fortifications including tank shelters, trenches and an underground kitchen. For 1,000 servicemen, Chernobyl became home. The Kremlin seemed unaware of – or indifferent to – the risks posed by radiation to its service personnel. The bulk of Putin’s invading army kept going. It headed south through the pine forest and along a smooth asphalt road leading to Kyiv, 130km away. The route goes past bucolic mini-lakes and bogs, and past gulls and the odd swan. “On the second day, 1,700 vehicles went through my village,” Davidenko said. “We counted them. They moved in four lanes. There were combat and Mi-2 transport helicopters flying continuously above us in formation, shaking the windows. The Ka-52 attack helicopters flew extremely low, 100 metres from the ground, dipping up and down.” Davidenko, 68, works as a ranger in Chernobyl’s national park. It is situated inside the 30km exclusion zone, which covers 260,000 hectares of territory. The Russian infantry fighting vehicles arriving every few minutes threw up clouds of radioactive dust. Soldiers, meanwhile, worked and slept in Chernobyl’s prohibited deadly red zone, near the abandoned city of Pripyat. Historians may describe what happened around Chernobyl as a case of imperial hubris. Speaking on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Kremlin had expected it could seize Kyiv within 48 hours. It had not anticipated much resistance. “Russia’s leadership expected to see a parade on Khreschatyk [the capital’s main street] after a few days,” he said. Instead, Ukrainian fighters ambushed the column near the city of Ivankiv, down the road from the Chernobyl checkpoint. Davidenko said he and other locals passed on the coordinates of enemy vehicles. This allowed home artillery to target the advance with lethal accuracy. Ukrainian soldiers slipped through the forest on foot or quad bikes, a phantom outfit of partisans. Enraged, the Russians began hunting for Ukrainian “spies”. Davidenko said they interrogated civilians in his village, Prybirsk, and confiscated mobile phones. “They even searched our clothes in case we had concealed notes,” he recounted. “Five young people had taken pictures of their tanks. They took them away. We don’t know what happened to them.” Ivan, a Ukrainian soldier nicknamed “the Frenchman”, said Russian troops were taken aback when they came under fire. They expected bread and salt – a traditional Ukrainian greeting – and were instead met with “fire and sword”, he said. He added: “The Moscow plan was blitzkrieg. When we attacked, it quickly became hell for them. Some abandoned their vehicles and ran off.” He stressed: “We knew the locality. They didn’t know how to orientate themselves.” Ivan praised his commanding officer for staying cool under Russian shelling. He said he took part in the battle for Kyiv last month around the city of Irpin. “We were under tremendous pressure. We Cossacks don’t go on our knees for anyone, except for our mothers and the national flag. This isn’t merely a war for our independence. It’s for European values,” he said. Over at the nuclear power plant, the original staff worked for 25 days under Russian supervision. Forty-five volunteers then replaced them. All were unable to monitor radiation levels because the soldiers stole their computer servers. They also took tables, furniture, microwaves and Chernobyl staff uniforms, said Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone state agency. Kramarenko said the troops would have breathed in radionuclides, especially during physical activity and trench-digging. “We believe they will feel the consequences of the radiation they received. Some sooner, some later,” he said. “This is the first time the world has seen tanks at a nuclear power plant.” For more than a month the Russians also occupied the villages surrounding the zone. Five of them broke into the farmstead where Yulia Mikhailenko, 28, lived with her mother, Zoya, and her daughters, six-year-old Karmila and one-year-old Zlata, in Khocheva. The women hid in the forest for several days, cold and hungry, until one of the girls got sick with a temperature. Mikhailenko went home to get medicine. She found the conscripts living there. They had broken her front door. “The house was a mess. They took everything. Gold, my laptop, flashcards and all of our crockery, including the frying pan. I said: “You can see children live here. Why did you do this?’ They looked a bit guilty and stared at their boots. They also cut our electricity cable.” On her fridge the soldiers had scratched: “Glory to Russia”. They painted graffiti on an outside wall of a monkey smiley beneath the word “Ukraine”. The monkey had a cross for a mouth – implying, it appeared, that Mikhailenko’s country should now shut up. “We were very afraid,” she said. “Then on 31 March they suddenly left.” The Kremlin announced that it was pulling its forces out of the Kyiv region in preparation for a major offensive in the east. The Russians had advanced from Chernobyl as far as the village of Demydiv, between the Irpin river and a dam next to Kyiv’s reservoir. They were unable to go further. As they retreated back to the exclusion zone, the blew up several bridges. Back in the exclusion zone, soldiers drove a stream of stolen Ukrainian vehicles back to Belarus, as well as their own military hardware. They took the captured national guardsmen with them. They were summoned to the power plant’s conference room, where their hands were bound, and they were driven off. “We don’t know where they are,” Kramarenko said. Ukraine’s nuclear agency is now trying to clear up the damage. The plant is still without electricity. The departing Russians left tripwires and mines concealed among radioactive trees. Kramarenko said five of his staff were killed while fighting in territorial defence units. Others were in a “difficult” psychological state after being forced to cohabit with their occupiers. On Wednesday the signs of fighting were all around. A kilometre from the Dytiatky control point the carcass of a burnt-out Russian infantry vehicle lay on the forest road. “Glory to Ukraine” was painted on its side in white letters. Swirling tracks in the sand and cut fir branches marked where its crew had parked. There were Russian ration packages and empty bottles. Davidenko said he had survived the Russian takeover relatively unscathed. He managed to hide his car, snowplough and canoe in the forest. The exclusion zone’s animal denizens appeared to have ignored one of this century’s most extraordinary battles, he said. They included bears, elk, deer and white storks who feed from the fish-rich Pripyat River. “They are flourishing. Their numbers are going up,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/01/hinkley-point-b-nuclear-plant-could-be-spared-imminent-closure","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-01T13:04:40Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point B nuclear plant could be spared imminent closure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/01/hinkley-point-b-nuclear-plant-could-be-spared-imminent-closure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/01/hinkley-point-b-nuclear-plant-could-be-spared-imminent-closure","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point B nuclear plant could be spared imminent closure","bodyText":"Nuclear power advocates believe the energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is open to extending the life of the Hinkley Point B plant to help wean the UK off gas imports and prevent a faster-than-expected decline in Britain’s fleet of atomic reactors. Soaring gas prices and the war in Ukraine have already spurred the government to ask coal power plant owners to stay open longer, while ministers also revisited their staunch opposition to fracking in the light of energy supply concerns. There is a growing feeling in the nuclear industry and its supporters that Kwarteng could also be persuaded to back an extension of up to 18 months to the life of Hinkley Point B, which is due to stop generating electricity this summer. Such a plan, which would chime with Boris Johnson’s backing for new nuclear in the recent energy security plan, would keep 1GW of electricity generation on the National Grid in the short term, replacing the need for gas-fired generation for up to 1.5m homes. The Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, whose Bridgwater and West Somerset constituency includes Hinkley, said he had spoken to Kwarteng about the possibility and that he was “definitely” open to it. “Kwasi is no fool,” he said. “He understands the stresses and strains we’re going through and that we need to look at everything we can. They are fully aware of what the [Hinkley] B station is capable of. She’s old but she’s in good health.” Hinkley’s owner, EDF Energy, would have to produce a safety case for extending the life of a power station that was hooked up to the grid in 1976 and whose closure was previously postponed by seven years in 2012. EDF would have to prove to the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) that the ageing graphite cores of the plant’s reactors remain in good enough condition that control rods could be inserted, even in the event of a huge and unprecedented earthquake, to prevent a nuclear accident. One nuclear industry source said there was a “six-week window” left, during which EDF could still make that case in time for the ONR to give a verdict on the safety of the plans and postpone the scheduled end to Hinkley generating electricity on 15 July. Greg Hands, a junior minister in Kwarteng’s business and energy department (BEIS), visited Hinkley last week. Engineers there are understood to have told Hands that they expected the plant to shut as scheduled. But the nuclear industry source said that while engineers were naturally focused on shutdown plans they had been working towards for many months, senior figures at EDF were likely to be more open to extending Hinkley’s life. The ONR would ultimately decide on whether such a plan could go ahead but Kwarteng’s approval is crucial. This is because EDF would incur significant costs to put together a safety case for an extension and would need to be confident that ministers would not block it. EDF declined to comment on whether it was planning to do so. BEIS said it had not held any discussions about such a proposal. “It [extending Hinkley] would stop you having to import a chunk of gas,” said the nuclear industry source. The Guardian also understands that Torness, near Dunbar, and Heysham 2 in Lancashire could come off grid earlier than expected, depending on regular assessments of the state of their graphite cores. Their retirement has already been brought forward, with EDF saying earlier this year that they would stop generating in 2028, rather than 2030. In theory, each station that operates for a year can replace more than 1bn cubic metres of gas imports. While nuclear power is traditionally expensive, the sky-high price of gas in recent months, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, means the £45 per megawatt hour that EDF gets from its nuclear contract is significantly below wholesale market power prices. The trade unions Prospect and the GMB have also called for the life of Britain’s nuclear fleet to be extended. Pressure on Kwarteng to signal to EDF that the government would back plans to keep Hinkley Point B open comes against the backdrop of concern that the capacity of Britain’s nuclear fleet could be declining even faster than thought. Based on current projections for the retirement of reactors and the building of new ones, UK nuclear capacity will fall from 5.8GW today to 4.4GW in 2028, factoring in the construction of Hinkley Point C but also the end of life of Torness and Heysham. However, the 2028 completion date for Hinkley Point C, which is already over budget and behind schedule is under review, with a forecast due this summer. • This article was amended on 2 May 2022 to refer correctly to the graphite cores and control rods of reactors, rather than to graphite rods."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/23/zelenskiy-calls-on-japan-to-impose-trade-embargo-on-russian-goods","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-23T16:27:40Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy calls on Japan to impose trade embargo on Russian goods","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/zelenskiy-calls-on-japan-to-impose-trade-embargo-on-russian-goods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/23/zelenskiy-calls-on-japan-to-impose-trade-embargo-on-russian-goods","fields":{"headline":"Zelenskiy calls on Japan to impose trade embargo on Russian goods","bodyText":"The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on Japan to increase pressure on Russia by imposing a trade embargo on Russian goods, in a virtual address to MPs in Tokyo. Zelenskiy, who has delivered carefully tailored speeches to lawmakers in the US, UK and other countries, thanked Japan for “leading the way” among Asian countries in condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and imposing sanctions. “Responsible states unite to protect peace. I am grateful to your state for its principled position at such a historic moment, for real assistance to Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said on Wednesday in the first address of its kind to Japanese lawmakers. “You were the first in Asia who really began to put pressure on Russia to restore peace, who supported sanctions against Russia, and I urge you to keep doing this.” In a later address to French MPs he called on French companies including Renault and the supermarket group Auchan to leave Russia. He compared the destruction of Mariupol with “the ruins of Verdun as in the photos of the first world war that everyone has seen”. Zelenskiy claimed in his address to Japanese MPs that Russian forces were preparing to use chemical weapons and launch new attacks from the exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which Russian troops occupied last month in the early stages of the invasion. He offered no details, but said four of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were in a “dangerous” state. The Chernobyl plant suffered a catastrophic accident 25 years before the March 2011 meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in north-east Japan, although Zelenskiy did not mention Fukushima in his address. Japan has joined international sanctions against the Kremlin and offered humanitarian assistance. Its sanctions on 76 individuals, seven banks and 12 other bodies in Russia cover defence officials and the state-owned arms exporter Rosoboronexport. It has also said it will revoke Russia’s trade status of most favoured nation. Japan has also accepted a small number of Ukrainians fleeing the war and voiced a willingness to take more – a gesture that surprised many given its usually strict rules on refugees and asylum seekers. In response, Russia has labelled Japan an “unfriendly” country and this week said it was suspending negotiations over a longstanding territorial dispute that has prevented the two countries from signing a postwar peace treaty. Japan and Russia both lay claim to the Kuril islands – known as the Northern Territories in Japan – which were invaded by Soviet forces towards the end of the second world war. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, last week said Russia was “illegally occupying” the islands, located near Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido. “We also have to think about Ukraine’s recovery after the war, about the people who have been forced from their homes and their strong desire to return home,” Zelenskiy said. I think the people of Japan understand that feeling.” Zelenskiy had angered some conservative Japanese MPs when he invoked Pearl Harbor in appealing for more help from the US in a recent address to Congress. “Remember Pearl Harbor, terrible morning of 7 December 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you,” Zelensky said last week. “Just remember it, remember, September 11, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn US cities into battlefields, when innocent people were attacked from air, just like nobody else expected it and you could not stop it. Our country experiences the same, every day, right now at this moment.” On Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader received a standing ovation after his 12-minute address, which he ended by thanking his audience in Japanese."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/nov/27/russian-raids-western-apathy-kyiv-putin-ukrainians-us-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T09:00:03Z","webTitle":"Even amid murderous Russian raids, western apathy is Kyiv’s deadliest foe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/27/russian-raids-western-apathy-kyiv-putin-ukrainians-us-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/27/russian-raids-western-apathy-kyiv-putin-ukrainians-us-europe","fields":{"headline":"Even amid murderous Russian raids, western apathy is Kyiv’s deadliest foe","bodyText":"A two-day-old baby is killed in an attack on a maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Officials say at least 437 children have died since Russia’s invasion began. More than 800 have been injured. How many kids are permanently traumatised is anybody’s guess. Every day, Vladimir Putin gets away with murder. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is shelled again, despite repeated UN warnings of Europe-wide catastrophe. In liberated Kherson, more grisly evidence of war crimes is uncovered. Wherever the Russians go, it’s the same horror story. Every day the killers go unpunished. Relentless waves of indiscriminate missile strikes darken Ukrainian skies, pulverising apartment blocks, clinics, shopping centres and schools. Moscow no longer even pretends to target the military. Its aim: to terrorise civilians. Destroying electricity, heat and water supplies to the main cities, already suffering food and medicine shortages, is key to Putin’s winter war. He strives to break Ukraine’s will, imperilling millions besieged by snow and ice. Every day, he perpetrates crimes against humanity. Russia’s red-handed army of homicidal generals, incompetent field commanders, out-of-control soldiers and hapless conscripts is attempting genocide – annihilation of a nation and a people – in plain sight. The European parliament voted last week to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Good. Now order Putin’s arrest! Issue warrants for the president and all his gang. Expel his lying diplomats. Penalise his pals. Close the borders. Or is this feelgood Euro-posturing? The question is rhetorical. You know the answer. As blacked-out Moldova warned last week, another huge humanitarian and migrant crisis looms, akin to that of last spring. It will challenge every EU country. Yet as the strain of multiple Ukraine-related problems begins to tell, European support may be faltering at this critical juncture. The war and its atrocities are being normalised and, increasingly, discounted. Where is the outrage now? Where the visceral fury? Nine months in, western public opinion is dulled, deadened and desensitised by a daily diet of remote, unceasing, almost routine carnage. People are no longer shocked, nor even greatly surprised. They feel powerless. The majority still wants Ukraine to prevail. But victory is not expected soon. In the absence of peace talks or any relief, war fatigue teeters towards apathy. In Italy and Germany, far-right voices complain they are “fed up” with the war’s costly knock-on effects. Protests against the stand-off with Moscow pockmark central Europe. Conflicted fellow travellers give Putin leave to carry on killing. It’s only November. For everyone, the worst of winter is yet to come. And there are limits to how often Kyiv can repair damaged pylons, cables and power plants. As soon as they are fixed, missiles blow them apart. “Invincibility shelters” can only do so much. “Today is just one day, but we have received 70 missiles. That’s the Russian formula of terror,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last Wednesday. “Hospitals, schools, transport, residential districts all suffered.” As usual, the “firm reaction” he demanded from the UN security council never came. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, says it’s obvious what Putin wants: “Ukraine without Ukrainians.” More than 7.8 million people have fled as refugees since February, the UN estimates. Millions more are internally displaced. Concern grows about a second exodus. “Right now, across the country, people are facing a grim choice: flee or freeze,” said Jan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council. With temperatures falling as low as -20C (-4F), Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days so far”, the World Health Organization’s regional director, Hans Kluge, warned. “Put simply, this winter will be about survival.” Nato countries have provided generous billions in financial aid and weapons systems to Ukraine. But the pace is slowing. The EU’s latest sanctions package has been repeatedly diluted and delayed. It is bickering over a Russian oil price cap. The west is also struggling to meet Ukraine’s desperate need for anti-missile defences. Stocks of Stinger, S-300, Nasams, Hawk and Starstreak missiles are low. Supplies of more sophisticated systems, such as American Patriots and Germany’s Iris-T, are limited by production and training issues. If the US, Britain and others had heeded Zelenskiy’s pleas last spring for Nato-guaranteed safe havens or some form of defensive no-fly or air exclusion zones, Ukrainians might have been spared today’s missile hell. It’s not too late to act. As the war becomes a familiar fact of daily life, and negative fallout spreads, will public support soften further? Pro-Kyiv sentiment in Europe stands at about 57%, according to a Eupinions poll. But that figure is down on the summer – and the “peace camp” is advancing. For example, 60% of Germans favour diplomacy. In the US, satisfaction over Ukraine’s military successes has led, paradoxically, to complacency – and reduced focus on continuing threats. When Republicans take control in Congress in January, aid may be cut. In Ukraine itself, in contrast, public attitudes are hardening. Pride in the Ukrainian nation and pro-western, pro-EU sentiment have never been stronger – including among ethnic minority Russians. Overall, 89% of respondents in one survey accused Russia of genocide. The Ukrainian people are a formidable force. They have shown they can beat their enemies. But should they fear their friends? A weakening of US and European support, leaving Ukraine out in the cold, is perhaps the most dismaying hazard they face. Putin is counting on it. Might the peoples of the west, for the sake of a quiet life, really get “fed up” with the war to the point where they are ready to ignore or even tolerate mass murder, war crimes and the evisceration of a sovereign nation as the new normal? It’s democracy’s biggest test. Every day, it gets harder in Ukraine. One thing is certain: it’s going to be a long winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-denies-wagner-claims-of-bakhmut-breakthrough-by-ukraine","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-12T17:49:44Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zelenskiy thanks UK for Storm Shadow missiles; Kremlin denies ground lost in Bakhmut – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-denies-wagner-claims-of-bakhmut-breakthrough-by-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-denies-wagner-claims-of-bakhmut-breakthrough-by-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zelenskiy thanks UK for Storm Shadow missiles; Kremlin denies ground lost in Bakhmut – as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is almost 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s stories: In a tweet, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked the British prime minister Rishi Sunak for the provision of long-range cruise missiles. Yesterday, the UK defence secretary Ben Wallace confirmed that the UK would send long-range cruise missiles. Two Russian pilots were killed on Friday when a Russian Mi-28 military helicopter crashed in the annexed peninsula of Crimea, Russian news agencies reported, citing the defence ministry. The defence ministry said it believed the reason for the crash was equipment failure, the TASS news agency reported. Russia’s defence ministry has said some of its troops fell back “to more advantageous defensive positions” near a reservoir north-west of the east Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. The statement on Friday was the first admission by Moscow that Ukraine was successfully recapturing ground around Bakhmut, a largely destroyed city with a prewar population of about 70,000 that Russia has been trying to conquer for more than 10 months. Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose troops have done the bulk of the fighting in and around Bakhmut, said via his press service that what the defence ministry had described was in fact a “rout” which had seen troops flee. He said Ukraine had been able to completely regain control of a crucial supply road that links Bakhmut with the town of Chasiv Yar and had seized useful higher ground, Reuters reported. Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive to win back territory occupied by Russia has a good chance of success but may bring high casualties if Russia uses its prepared defences well, Czech president and former Nato general Petr Pavel said on Friday. Pavel, 61, said in an interview that Ukraine needs support for Nato and European Union entry but joining either will be a lengthy process, though talks on the EU accession could start this year, Reuters reported. Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit to detect unmanned drones after a suspected attack on the Kremlin earlier this month, Reuters reports. The unit launched on 9 May during the annual the second world war victory day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow had never refused the “diplomatic track” to resolving the conflict in Ukraine in a phone call with his South African counterpart, the Kremlin said. Putin said he supported South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s proposal to involve African leaders in talks regarding a peace process for Ukraine, according to the Kremlin’s readout of the call. Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday that Ukrainian forces carried out “offensive operations” on Thursday along the entire line of contact near Soledar, the ministry’s official Zvezda news outlet reported. More than a thousand troops and up to 40 tanks were used in the assault, it said, adding that the attacks were “repulsed”. UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have told Reuters. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic nuclear accident from military activity like shelling at Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which is in Ukraine and has been occupied by Russia for more than a year. A Russian defeat in Ukraine will not derail China’s rise, while relations between Beijing and the EU will be “critically affected” if Xi Jinping does not push Vladimir Putin to withdraw his forces, European ministers have been told. The message comes in a paper drawn up by the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who is meeting the EU’s 27 foreign ministers on Friday in Stockholm to discuss how the bloc should “recalibrate” its policy towards Beijing. Russia’s defence ministry has denied reports that Ukrainian forces had broken through in various places along the frontlines and said the military situation was under control. Moscow was reacting after Russian military bloggers, writing on the Telegram messaging app, reported apparent Ukrainian advances north and south of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, with some suggesting a long-awaited counteroffensive by pro-Kyiv forces had started. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had earlier said the offensive had yet to start. Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, has said that parties to the Black Sea grain initiative are approaching an extension. Akar’s comment was released by his ministry in a statement on Friday, after talks in Istanbul. Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Musiyenko says Kyiv’s backers understand that a counteroffensive “may not result in the complete eviction of Russian troops and the definitive defeat of Russia in all occupied areas”. “We have to be ready for the war to continue into next year - or it could end this year,” Musiyenko told Ukrainian NV Radio. “It all depends on how the battles develop. We can’t guarantee how the counter-offensive will develop.” The Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Donetsk has reported on Telegram that one person was killed by Ukrainian shelling of the city overnight. The commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has said its defences are being tightened amid a flurry of Ukrainian drone strikes targeting its home base, the Crimean port of Sevastopol. V-Adm Viktor Sokolov told Friday’s edition of the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda: “In connection with the threat of attacks by robotic surface and underwater systems, we have increased the technical defences of the fleet’s main base and of the ships’ anchorages”. Sokolov said the Black Sea Fleet, whose flagship, the cruiser Moskva, was sunk by Ukraine in April 2022, would receive four new ships in 2023. China’s foreign ministry has announced that its special representative of Eurasian affairs will visit Ukraine, Poland, France, Germany and Russia from Monday in what it calls “an effort to promote peace talks”, US President Joe Biden and Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez will discuss Ukraine, defence cooperation, and migration on Friday during a meeting at the White House. While Madrid agrees with Washington on the illegality of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Sánchez will convey the divergent views of China and Brazil and propose giving greater weight to the views of non-Nato nations hurt by the war, a Spanish diplomatic source told Reuters. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine war live blog for today. Thanks for following along. UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have told Reuters. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic nuclear accident from military activity like shelling at Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which is in Ukraine and has been occupied by Russia for more than a year. With Ukraine preparing a counteroffensive in the area, there is a risk that fighting near the plant and its six reactors will intensify. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling that has repeatedly downed power lines vital to cooling the reactors and preventing a nuclear meltdown. “It looks promising,” one diplomat said about securing an agreement. Others said Ukraine, which long opposed the plan, now backed it while Russia’s position was less clear. Russia’s defence ministry has said some of its troops fell back “to more advantageous defensive positions” near a reservoir north-west of the east Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. The statement on Friday was the first admission by Moscow that Ukraine was successfully recapturing ground around Bakhmut, a largely destroyed city with a prewar population of about 70,000 that Russia has been trying to conquer for more than 10 months. The Russian defence statement came hours after Kyiv said that its forces had advanced by about 2km (1.2 miles) around Bakhmut this week. Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, said on Friday: “The enemy suffered great losses of manpower. Our defenders advanced 2km in the Bakhmut sector. We did not lose a single position in Bakhmut this week.” It came as Russia’s foreign ministry condemned the UK for supplying Ukraine with the long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles that Kyiv wants to boost its chances in a counteroffensive – the first western country to do so. Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive to win back territory occupied by Russia has a good chance of success but may bring high casualties if Russia uses its prepared defences well, Czech president and former Nato general Petr Pavel said on Friday. Pavel, 61, said in an interview that Ukraine needs support for Nato and European Union entry but joining either will be a lengthy process, though talks on the EU accession could start this year, Reuters reported. Pavel, who was Czech army chief and also the principal military adviser to the Nato secretary-general in 2015-2018, said Ukraine would eventually get western fighter jets it has been calling for but it was impossible to deliver them in time for the upcoming offensive, and there were higher priorities such as ammunition. “There is certainly high hope that the Ukrainian counteroffensive will be successful, because Ukraine is motivated, well prepared, its troops are experienced and certainly do not succumb to such deficiencies as the Russian army,” Pavel said at Prague Castle, the seat of the Czech presidency. The Russian army had severe problems in logistics and morale, but a collapse of defences should not be expected, he said. “Russia has had time to prepare a relatively high-quality and in-depth defence in several lines, which, if used effectively, will cost … Ukraine large casualties,” he said. It was impossible to say what size of territory Ukraine could win back as various scenarios were open, he said. “Things do not always go according to wishes and plans but I think that the chance for a significant Ukrainian success is really high.” White House national security council spokesperson John Kirby said on Friday that the Biden administration has consistently urged countries not to provide weapons for Russia’s war with Ukraine when asked about US allegations that South Africa sent an arms shipment to Russia. Kirby declined to talk specifically on the South Africa issue, but said “it’s a serious issue.” A Russian defeat in Ukraine will not derail China’s rise, while relations between Beijing and the EU will be “critically affected” if Xi Jinping does not push Vladimir Putin to withdraw his forces, European ministers have been told. The message comes in a paper drawn up by the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who is meeting the EU’s 27 foreign ministers on Friday in Stockholm to discuss how the bloc should “recalibrate” its policy towards Beijing. Along with the war in Ukraine, relations with China have become Europe’s most pressing foreign policy issue, but EU politicians take different approaches on how to respond to an increasingly repressive and nationalistic Beijing – revealed in the furore over Emmanuel Macron’s comments about not being drawn into a US-China clash over Taiwan. In a letter to ministers to accompany the paper, Borrell highlights at least three reasons to adjust the EU’s approach: China’s internal changes “with nationalism and ideology on the rise”; the “hardening of US-China competition” in all areas and China’s status as a key regional and global player. Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow had never refused the “diplomatic track” to resolving the conflict in Ukraine in a phone call with his South African counterpart, the Kremlin said. Putin said he supported South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s proposal to involve African leaders in talks regarding a peace process for Ukraine, according to the Kremlin’s readout of the call. He also repeated an offer to deliver Russian grain and fertilisers free of charge to African countries, Reuters reported. It came as South Africa’s foreign ministry summoned the US ambassador over allegations he made that the country had provided arms and ammunition to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Amid the diplomatic fallout, South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, would also speak with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation said in a statement posted on Twitter. The US ambassador, Reuben Brigety, said at a press conference on Thursday that South Africa had loaded weapons and ammunition on to a sanctioned Russian vessel at the Simon’s Town Naval Base near the city of Cape Town in December last year. The arms were then transported to Russia, Brigety said. Two Russian pilots were killed on Friday when a Russian Mi-28 military helicopter crashed in the annexed peninsula of Crimea, Russian news agencies reported, citing the defence ministry. The defence ministry said it believed the reason for the crash was equipment failure, the TASS news agency reported. The crash occurred at 3.42pm local time during a training flight, and the helicopter was flying without weapons, news agencies cited the defence ministry as saying in a statement. An investigation was opened to confirm the cause of the crash, which occurred in the Dzhankoi region of northern Crimea. Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose troops have done the bulk of the fighting in and around Bakhmut, said via his press service that what the defence ministry had described was in fact a “rout” which had seen troops flee. He said Ukraine had been able to completely regain control of a crucial supply road that links Bakhmut with the town of Chasiv Yar and had seized useful higher ground, Reuters reported. The risk, he said, was that if more ground was lost Ukrainian forces could gradually encircle Bakhmut. Prigozhin, who has been openly feuding with Russia’s defence ministry for months, has repeatedly accused the top brass of sabotaging Wagner’s push for Bakhmut and this week accused them of doing too little to protect Bakhmut’s flanks. The ministry appeared to push back against that assertion on Friday, saying that Ukrainian attempts to counterattack Bakhmut’s flanks were being repelled. Prigozhin complained his men were still not getting enough shells and equipment, but said they were still advancing in Bakhmut and only needed to capture around a further 20 buildings to take full control of the city. Bakhmut, much of which now lies in ruins, has been the focus of fierce fighting for months. In a tweet, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked the British prime minister Rishi Sunak for the provision of long-range cruise missiles. He said: Had a phone call with UK prime minister Rishi Sunak. Thanked for the significant enhancement of our capabilities with long-range Storm Shadow missiles and other irreplaceable military assistance. We discussed further defence cooperation and coordinated our positions on the eve of upcoming international events. In particular, we need clear signals about Ukraine’s future with Nato. Yesterday, the UK defence secretary Ben Wallace confirmed that the UK would send long-range cruise missiles. Zelenskiy is expected to attend the next Nato summit in Vilnius in July, but has repeatedly requested for a firmer time table and more concrete steps for Ukraine to join the alliance. Belgium will use €92m (£81m/$101m) it has received in taxes on frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine, its government said on Friday, Reuters reports. Half of the amount will be used to deliver military goods such as armoured vehicles, weapons and munition. The rest is earmarked for humanitarian support, the future reconstruction of Ukraine and strengthening Belgium’s diplomatic presence in the country, the government said. Rishi Sunak is disappointed that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s request to address the Eurovision song contest was refused, the UK prime minister’s spokesperson said on Friday. Ukraine’s president had requested to make a video appearance during the final on Saturday in Liverpool. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said on Thursday that while Zelenskiy’s request was made with “laudable intentions”, granting it would be against the non-political nature of the event and its rules prohibiting making political statements. “The prime minister believes it would be fitting for President Zelenskiy to address the event and we are disappointed by the decision,” Sunak’s spokesperson said. “The value and freedoms that President Zelenskiy and the people of Ukraine are fighting for are not political, they are fundamental. Eurovision themselves recognised that last year when they rightly suspended Russia’s participation from the competition.” Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit to detect unmanned drones after a suspected attack on the Kremlin earlier this month, Reuters reports. The unit launched on 9 May during the annual the second world war victory day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. In a video message, Roman Uvarov, the department’s head, said it will “ensure the protection of public order” during large public events. The unit will include officers armed with snipers and carbines, groups trained to neutralise unmanned drones, and mobile patrols to detain those suspected of operating drones. Two Russian strategic bombers have conducted routine flights over the Chukchi Sea between Siberia and Alaska, the Tass news agency said on Friday. “In the course of the flight, the crews of the long-range aircraft carried out aerial refuelling,” Tass quoted the defence ministry as saying. At a secret location in southern Ukraine, Roman Kostenko watched a drone rise into the sky. It ascended to a height of 100 metres, buzzing above a yellow rapeseed field. The drone dropped a dummy anti-tank grenade on to a pile of tyres. The test worked. That night Kostenko’s team repeated the exercise over occupied territory. Two bombs fell on a Russian armoured fighting vehicle. It blew up, smoke pluming into darkness. Kostenko, a decorated special forces colonel, said his unit had destroyed dozens of Russian military objects. They included tanks and howitzer guns. These operations took place every night on “a tactical level”, he said, close to the frontline. This stretches for 900 miles, from the eastern city of Bakhmut where Ukrainian troops launched a local counterattack this week, to the southern provinces of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. There has been intense speculation that Kyiv is about to launch a major counteroffensive. On Thursday night, Russian military bloggers erroneously reported that it had already started. Speaking earlier the same day, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his forces needed “some more time”. According to Kostenko, Ukraine’s long-anticipated push should be understood as a rolling “spring-summer campaign” against an entrenched and powerful adversary. Kostenko said the campaign was already unfolding in stages. The first saw the step-by-step elimination of Russia’s military potential, with strikes against logistical targets such as weapons depots and fuel dumps. This has begun, he said. A second stage involved seeking out and eliminating Russian command and control centres, causing a breakdown of communications with troops in the field. “That’s already happening too, probably,” he said. Ukraine’s armed forces were unlikely to embark on a major frontal offensive until they had weakened Moscow’s battlefield capability, he indicated. “Our army won’t go forward until this preparation work is done. We can’t win if they have large amounts of ammunition and resources,” he said. He acknowledged that Ukraine was playing a disinformation game about when and where it might strike, with signs that it was working, and that Moscow was beginning to panic. Germany aims to buy 18 Leopard 2 tanks for €525m (£457m) to replace tanks delivered to Ukraine, a defence source told Reuters on Friday. The total price including an option for another 105 tanks will be €2.9bn (£2.5bn) and the German parliament’s budget committee is expected to sign off on the deal at the end of May, the source said. Germany has supplied 18 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year and has said it intends to plug the gap with new tanks as soon as possible. The Leopard is jointly manufactured by KMW and Rheinmetall. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is “disappointed” in the decision of the European Broadcasting Union, Downing Street has said, after it was reported that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was blocked from addressing Eurovision. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: The prime minister believes it would be fitting for President Zelenskiy to address the event and we’re disappointed by the decision from the European Broadcasting Union. The values and freedoms that President Zelenskiy and the people of Ukraine are fighting for are not political, they’re fundamental, and Eurovision themselves recognised that last year when they rightly suspended Russia’s participation from the competition. There are no plans to intervene and ask broadcasters to change their mind, Downing Street suggested. The Kremlin said on Friday that a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and the Chinese special envoy Li Hui, who is to tour European countries next week to discuss Ukraine, had not yet been set up. “There is no such meeting in the schedule yet. This will all be worked out through diplomatic channels,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday that Ukrainian forces carried out “offensive operations” on Thursday along the entire line of contact near Soledar, the ministry’s official Zvezda news outlet reported. More than a thousand troops and up to 40 tanks were used in the assault, it said, adding that the attacks were “repulsed”. The Kremlin said on Friday that there was nothing new to report after talks on possible renewal of the Black Sea grain deal in Istanbul, and that a potential conversation between the leaders of Turkey and Russia would not help clinch an agreement, Reuters reports. In one of his regular calls with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that only full implementation of the deal would facilitate its renewal. Russia has repeatedly insisted that western sanctions are impeding its export of agricultural products, and that it is unwilling to extend the deal to allow Ukraine to export grain unless this changes. It cites the disconnection of the Russian Agricultural Bank from the Swift payment system and difficulties in being able to insure export vessels as being among factors that need to be addressed. Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said earlier on Friday that parties to the Black Sea grain pact were nearing a deal to extend it. Russia’s defence ministry has denied reports that Ukrainian forces had broken through in various places along the frontlines and said the military situation was under control. Moscow was reacting after Russian military bloggers, writing on the Telegram messaging app, reported apparent Ukrainian advances north and south of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, with some suggesting a long-awaited counteroffensive by pro-Kyiv forces had started. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had earlier said the offensive had yet to start. Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, has said that parties to the Black Sea grain initiative are approaching an extension. Akar’s comment was released by his ministry in a statement on Friday, after talks in Istanbul. Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Musiyenko says Kyiv’s backers understand that a counteroffensive “may not result in the complete eviction of Russian troops and the definitive defeat of Russia in all occupied areas”. “We have to be ready for the war to continue into next year - or it could end this year,” Musiyenko told Ukrainian NV Radio. “It all depends on how the battles develop. We can’t guarantee how the counter-offensive will develop.” The Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Donetsk has reported on Telegram that one person was killed by Ukrainian shelling of the city overnight. The commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has said its defences are being tightened amid a flurry of Ukrainian drone strikes targeting its home base, the Crimean port of Sevastopol. V-Adm Viktor Sokolov told Friday’s edition of the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda: “In connection with the threat of attacks by robotic surface and underwater systems, we have increased the technical defences of the fleet’s main base and of the ships’ anchorages”. Sokolov said the Black Sea Fleet, whose flagship, the cruiser Moskva, was sunk by Ukraine in April 2022, would receive four new ships in 2023. China’s foreign ministry has announced that its special representative of Eurasian affairs will visit Ukraine, Poland, France, Germany and Russia from Monday in what it calls “an effort to promote peace talks”, US President Joe Biden and Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez will discuss Ukraine, defence cooperation, and migration on Friday during a meeting at the White House. While Madrid agrees with Washington on the illegality of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Sánchez will convey the divergent views of China and Brazil and propose giving greater weight to the views of non-Nato nations hurt by the war, a Spanish diplomatic source told Reuters. US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen met German finance minister Christian Lindner on Friday, to underscore the importance of working together to counter evasion of sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine, the US Treasury has said. The prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said on Friday they are considering speeding up a plan to disconnect the Baltic region’s electricity supply from Russia’s power grid. South Africa did not approve any arms shipment to Russia, the minister who chairs the country’s national conventional arms control committee, Mondli Gungubele, told local radio station 702 on Friday, Reuters reports. The United States envoy to South Africa said on Thursday he was confident that a Russian ship had picked up weapons in South Africa last year, in a possible breach of Pretoria’s declared neutrality in the Ukraine conflict. The ambassador’s assertion saw the rand and South African government bonds sell-off, as currency traders said they were worried that South Africa could now face western sanctions. The South African president Cyril Ramaphosa’s office said on Thursday that his government would open an inquiry led by a retired judge into the allegation that arms had been shipped to Russia. The prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said on Friday they are considering speeding up a plan to disconnect the Baltic region’s electricity supply from Russia’s power grid. “Today we agreed to continue discussions on accelerating as soon as all of our studies are finished,” Reuters reports Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas told a joint news conference with her Latvian and Lithuanian counterparts. “Technical studies, especially on production capacity and energy crisis, will allow us to clarify the details and exact timing of this process,” she added. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, will discuss Ukraine, defence cooperation, and migration on Friday during a meeting at the White House. While Madrid agrees with Washington on the illegality of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Sánchez will convey the divergent views of China and Brazil and propose giving greater weight to the views of non-Nato nations hurt by the war, a Spanish diplomatic source told Reuters. There isn’t often a huge amount of news available from the occupied areas of Ukraine, but a Reuters reporter has been allowed to speak to people at a temporary accommodation facility in the occupied port city of Berdiansk in Zaporizhzhia region, one of the areas of Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed acting governor of occupied Zaporizhzhia has said that the temporary relocation of people – prioritising families with children – was due to increased Ukrainian shelling of 18 settlements near the frontline. The claim has not been independently verified. Three evacuees interviewed by Reuters said they had chosen to be evacuated themselves for security reasons. Two expressed satisfaction with their new conditions. All said they hoped to one day return home. Lyudmila, 22, who said she chose to be evacuated from her home in the town of Kamianka-Dniprovska, said the situation there had sometimes been “difficult” and that shells had landed nearby. “We used to go out and watch. Especially at night, you could see the flashes as they launch. We’ve had shells land nearby and when it landed the entire sky was red,” she said. “People get used to it fast, children get used to it. They stop being afraid.” She said she thought people still remaining in her town were “sitting on suitcases” ready to leave if the situation there became more dangerous. She said she was hoping for peace and that the two sides could find common ground. Holding his family’s small dog in his arms as he spoke, a man who gave his name as Artyom said he chose to be evacuated from the town of Tokmak with his wife and children as a precaution. “We are sure that everything will be fine, but we don’t want to take any risks. When the opportunity arose, we left,” he said. Alyona Trokai, a representative for the Russian Movement for Children and Youth, which is working to help settle the evacuees, said around 2,000 people had arrived at the centre so far. Ukraine has repeatedly complained about Russian authorities relocating Ukrainian citizens. The commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has said its defences are being tightened amid a flurry of Ukrainian drone strikes targeting its home base, the Crimean port of Sevastopol, an area that the Russian Federation claimed to annex from Ukraine in 2014. Reuters reports V-Adm Viktor Sokolov told Friday’s edition of the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda: “In connection with the threat of attacks by robotic surface and underwater systems, we have increased the technical defences of the fleet’s main base and of the ships’ anchorages.” Sokolov said the Black Sea Fleet, whose flagship, the cruiser Moskva, was sunk by Ukraine in April 2022, would receive four new ships in 2023. Sevastopol has repeatedly been attacked with drones since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, met the German finance minister, Christian Lindner, on Friday, to underscore the importance of working together to counter evasion of sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine, the US Treasury has said. “Secretary Yellen expressed appreciation for Germany’s close coordination on the implementation of Russia sanctions and discussed the importance of aligning efforts to counter sanctions evasion,” Reuters reports it said in a statement. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that overnight there have been three explosions recorded in Sumy oblast. No casualties are known. China’s foreign ministry has announced that its special representative of Eurasian affairs will visit Ukraine, Poland, France, Germany and Russia from Monday in what it calls “an effort to promote peace talks”, Reuters reports. Xi Jinping, China’s president, had pledged in a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart last month that he would send a delegation to the region to help facilitate peace talks. It was the first time the two presidents had spoken since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. In April, a report on Chinese state TV said Xi had told Zelenskiy during their call: “Negotiation is the only viable way out.” Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has issued a combative statement in response to Uzbek and Azerbaijani news websites publishing an article by Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the president of Ukraine. In the course of it, she says: This libeler (he cannot be called anything else) is unable to accept this inconvenient truth: Russia is a friend and defender of anyone who is interested in its friendship and defence, anyone who does not act antagonistically at its doorstep, or attack its citizens, compatriots, culture or history. There are simply no examples to the contrary. The fact that our allies are providing platforms for a high-ranking representative of the Nazi authorities in Ukraine to distort the essence of our relations is certainly baffling. We know that the collective west, not hiding its intentions to inflict damage on Russia, would use anyone, including the post-Soviet countries – not actually considering them valuable partners, but springboards for attacks on our country that still have untapped potential as such. But it is precisely the Nazi essence of the current government in Kyiv, sponsored by the west, that has undermined the foundations of European security. We respect the freedom of the press. However, it is our belief that the information landscape in countries friendly to us cannot be a platform for broadcasting intentionally false and provocative fabrications. Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and during the course of what it terms its “special military operation” it has passed new laws restricting criticism of the war, and jailed journalists. Reuters has a quick snap that Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, has said that parties to the Black Sea grain initiative are approaching an extension. Reuters reports Akar’s comment was released by his ministry in a statement on Friday, after talks in Istanbul. The Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Donetsk has reported on Telegram that one person was killed by Ukrainian shelling of the city overnight. Alexei Kulemzin posted “As a result of the shelling of the Kyivskyi district of Donetsk region, a man of 40-50 years old was killed.” My colleague Archie Bland looks at what a Ukrainian counter-offensive might mean in practice in today’s First Edition newsletter: Ukraine’s greatest success of the war so far came when it successfully fooled Moscow into thinking its September attack would come in the south, and not in the northern Kharkiv region. Surprises over timing and location are the most powerful tool at Ukraine’s disposal as it attempts to regain lost territory, break Russian supply lines, and bolster western support for the long war that likely lies ahead. But it is also extremely difficult to maintain. After the stalemate of winter, Ukraine has talked openly about a planned counteroffensive for months. “We are preparing for it,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in April. “It will happen.” But yesterday, he suggested that despite endless speculation about the timing, his country’s forces were not yet ready. Ukrainian commanders have also said that Kyiv lacks vital weapons for the new push – but there are also reasons to be sceptical. The Economist’s defence editor Shashank Joshi wrote on Twitter that “Of course this is what you’d say if the counter-offensive was about to begin,” appending a shrug emoji. And it is always useful for Ukraine to increase pressure for more western military hardware. “Secrecy is very, very important,” the Guardian’s defence editor Dan Sabbagh said. “It’s essential to the success of what happens next. In Russian, it’s called ‘maskirova’ – the military concept of operational security and secrecy, but also active deception about what to expect. So we don’t know exactly what’s going to happen or when.” With a 900-mile frontline that divides occupied eastern territory roughly the size of Portugal from the rest of Ukraine, there are no shortage of possible sites for the attack. But there is a relatively brief list of options both viable enough and valuable enough to be plausible. “The ‘route one’ option, and the most obvious strategic imperative, is to cut the “land bridge” to Crimea,” Dan said. That would severely hamper supply lines to Russian troops in the rest of Ukraine as well as being a humiliating blow for Putin. “But the obvious counterpoint to that is that the geography is perfectly obvious to the Russians as well. They have been preparing for a possible attack and they are very well dug in.” There are other options available. “They could also try to attack Crimea by crossing the Dnieper River further west,” Dan said. “But the Dnieper is a formidable, wide river that has already hurt the Russians when they were forced to give up Kherson.” Also possible is a counterattack in Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia has the upper hand after long and bitter fighting – but Ukraine made its first significant gains in months this week. Finally, the Ukrainians could seek a breakthrough in the northern province of Luhansk – more sparsely defended, and providing a route to Russian-held cities in the Donbas. But there is less obvious strategic value in that territory. “And it’s quite close to Russia proper, so it would be easier to bring in reinforcements,” Dan added.

Ukraine’s defence ministry has issued some statistics about air attacks on Kyiv. The Ukrainian capital has faced 851 hours and 38 minutes of air alarms (the equivalent of just over 35 days) since 24 February 2022, the ministry said. It also states that “not a single missile or drone has reached its target” for over two months now thanks to air defence efforts. Rodion Miroshnik, formerly the self-styled ambassador to Russia of the Luhansk People’s Republic, has posted on Telegram that “the situation on the frontline in the north-west of the LPR has not changed significantly”. Tass quotes the Russian-imposed official as saying: “According to intelligence and satellite surveillance, there are attempts to concentrate [Ukrainian] armoured forces in the Krasnyi Lyman and Kupiansk directions. But so far they are at a distance from the zone adjacent to the line of contact.” The claims have not been independently verified. Luhansk is one of four partly occupied regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. According to Reuters, Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Musiyenko says Kyiv’s backers understand that a counteroffensive “may not result in the complete eviction of Russian troops and the definitive defeat of Russia in all occupied areas.” “We have to be ready for the war to continue into next year - or it could end this year,” Musiyenko told Ukrainian NV Radio. “It all depends on how the battles develop. We can’t guarantee how the counter-offensive will develop.” Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner private army which has led the fight in Bakhmut, on Thursday said Ukrainian operations were “unfortunately, partially successful”. He called Zelenskiy’s assertion that the counteroffensive had not yet begun “deceptive”. A strong explosion was heard in Melitopol in Zaporizhzhia a short whole ago, according to exiled mayor Ivan Fedorov. Zaporizhzhia is under Russian occupation. “A strong single explosion in Melitopol. Resounded in the very centre of the city,” Federov wrote on Telegram. He did not provide further details. In case you missed this yesterday: Britain has become the first western country to provide Ukraine with the long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles that Kyiv wants to boost its chances in a much-anticipated counteroffensive, prompting a threat from the Kremlin of a military response, the Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh and Luke Harding report. Hours after Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he needed more western weapons to be confident of a victory this summer, Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, told MPs that the missiles – which cost more than £2m each – were “now going in, or are in the country itself”. The gift of the missiles was supported by the US, Wallace added, although previously Washington had declined to give Ukraine long-range missiles of its own, fearing that the outcome could escalate hostilities in the 15-month war. “The use of Storm Shadow will allow Ukraine to push back Russian forces based within Ukrainian sovereign territory,” Wallace told MPs, adding: “Russia must recognise that their actions alone have led to such systems being provided.” Unnamed Kremlin sources say recent statements by Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin is “seriously disturbing the top leadership” in the Kremlin, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest update on the conflict. Citing a report by Russian opposition outlet Meduza, the US thinktank noted that the sources said “Prigozhin may have crossed the Kremlin’s “red lines” and may alienate his supporters within the Russian inner circle”. Russia’s defence ministry has denied reports that Ukrainian forces had broken through in various places along the front lines and said the military situation was under control, according to Reuters. Moscow was reacting after Russian military bloggers, writing on the Telegram messaging app, reported what they said were Ukrainian advances north and south of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, with some suggesting a long-awaited counteroffensive by pro-Kyiv forces had started. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had earlier said the offensive had yet to start. “Statements circulated by individual Telegram channels about ‘defence breakthroughs’ that took place in different areas along the line of military contact do not correspond to reality,” the Russian defence ministry said in a Telegram post. “The overall situation in the area of the special military operation is under control,” it said in a statement, using the Kremlin’s description of the war in Ukraine. The fact the Russian ministry felt obliged to release the statement reflects what Moscow acknowledges is a “very difficult” military operation. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Out top story this morning: Moscow has rejected reports by Russian military bloggers and Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin that Ukrainian forces have broken through Russian frontlines in the devastated city of Bakhmut. “Statements circulated by individual Telegram channels about ‘defence breakthroughs’ that took place in different areas along the line of military contact do not correspond to reality,” the Russian defence ministry said in a Telegram post. “The overall situation in the area of the special military operation is under control,” it said in a statement, using the Kremlin’s description of the war in Ukraine. Elsewhere: Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed reports that the UK is donating long-range Storm Shadow missiles to Ukraine. Wallace said Ukrainians will have the “best chance to defend themselves”. The US ambassador to South Africa has accused the country of covertly providing arms to Russia – a charge that drew an angry rebuke from Pretoria. Reuben Brigety told a media briefing that the US believed weapons and ammunition had been loaded on to a Russian freighter that docked at a Cape Town naval base in December. “We are confident that weapons were loaded on to that vessel and I would bet my life on the accuracy of that assertion,” Brigety said, according to a video of the remarks. “The arming of Russia by South Africa … is fundamentally unacceptable.” A Ukrainian brigade commander fighting in the ruins of Bakhmut said Russian mercenary forces have stepped up shelling and artillery attacks in recent days and were not facing a munitions shortage, despite its chief’s claims to the contrary. Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Thursday that the situation on the flanks near the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut was unfolding in line with the “worst of all expected scenarios”. Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, confirmed that the army was aware of a possible missile heading towards the country in December but failed to inform the government. Poland has been on alert for possible spillover of weaponry from the war in neighbouring Ukraine, especially since two people were killed near the border last November by what Warsaw concluded was a misfired Ukrainian air defence missile. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the country needs more time to prepare for a much-anticipated spring counteroffensive, saying: “We can go forward and be successful. But we’d lose a lot of people. I think that’s unacceptable. So we need to wait. We still need a bit more time.” Zelenskiy again denied any Ukrainian responsibility for the drone incident over the Kremlin. Russia has accused Washington and Kyiv of masterminding the attack, which it described as an assassination attempt on Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Putin was not in the Kremlin at the time, and no injuries were caused by the drones. A Ukrainian drone attacked an oil storage depot in the Russian border region of Bryansk, the local governor has claimed in a post on his Telegram channel on Thursday. There were no casualties after the attack on the facility near the town of Klintsy, owned by Russia’s Rosneft oil company, though one storage tank was partly damaged, the governor, Alexander Bogomaz, said. Belgorod’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, claimed that seven settlements in the Russian region have been left without electricity after Ukrainian shelling over the border."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-27T17:27:59Z","webTitle":"Defeat would leave Russia brutal and vindictive even if Putin ‘disappeared’, says RAF chief – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","fields":{"headline":"Defeat would leave Russia brutal and vindictive even if Putin ‘disappeared’, says RAF chief – as it happened","bodyText":"Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines. Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counteroffensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported. Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted. A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram. Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine. Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move. Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year. Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s Executive Board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine, which it invaded 15 months ago, from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva. Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The death toll from a Russian missile attack on an outpatient clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has risen to two, with 30 people wounded, according to media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “Russian terrorists once again confirm their status of fighters against everything humane and honest.” Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to visit Finland, Sweden and Norway from this Monday to deepen cooperation on top national security and economic issues, the US state department has said. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland has joined Nato, with Sweden’s bid to join awaiting ratification from Hungary and Turkey. A deal allowing the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports has not yet resumed full operations, the UN said on Friday, having come to a halt before Russia’s decision last week to extend it. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told China’s special envoy Li Hui there are “serious obstacles” to resuming peace talks, blaming Ukraine and western countries. Meanwhile, Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decades and negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was in power. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and former US president Donald Trump discussed Ukraine and “the vital importance of Ukrainian victory” on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson said. Two years ago, Raman Pratasevich, a young Belarusian dissident blogger, was white-knuckled, begging a Ryanair flight crew not to make an emergency landing at Minsk airport, writes Andrew Roth and Shaun Walker. He said: “Don’t do this, they will kill me, I am a refugee,” according to a fellow passenger. The plane, escorted by a Belarusian Mig-29 fighter jet sent to force it down, landed anyway. Pratasevich was promptly arrested. Last week he emerged from custody. The activist and blogger, accused of more than 1,586 crimes, was charged on 10 counts including conspiracy to seize power. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and then promptly pardoned, his reward from Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko for becoming a full-throated mouthpiece of the regime. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has tweeted this video footage. Around 400 Ukrainian soldiers have started training on American M1 Abrams tanks in Germany, the New York Times reported. Half of the group started training in Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels in southern Germany, being taught medical skills and how to shoot firearms. The other half were taught how to fuel and maintain the tanks. Around 31 tanks were due to be sent to Germany to be used in the training programme, which is expected to last 10 to 12 weeks, according to the newspaper. A 73-year-old woman has died and two others have been injured after Russian troops shelled 16 areas in Zaporizhzhia, a local Ukrainian governor said. Yurii Malashko reported that Russia had launched 108 attacks against the southeastern city in one day using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, and drones. Malashko wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “The enemy will be held accountable for every war crime, for every broken fate and life that has been cut short. Ukrainians are strong and unbreakable, Victory is ours.” The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 6pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s headlines: Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines.

Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland has joined Nato, with Sweden’s bid to join awaiting ratification from Hungary and Turkey. A deal allowing the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports has not yet resumed full operations, the UN said on Friday, having come to a halt before Russia’s decision last week to extend it. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told China’s special envoy Li Hui there are “serious obstacles” to resuming peace talks, blaming Ukraine and western countries. Meanwhile, Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decades and negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was in power. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and former US president Donald Trump discussed Ukraine and “the vital importance of Ukrainian victory” on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson said. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s Executive Board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine, which it invaded 15 months ago, from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva. Normally those joining the forum, which plays a key role in the governance of the WHO, are elected on the nod but Moscow forced the first vote since 1977 at this year’s 76th assembly. In the event, the vote was easily carried by 123 votes to 13. Russia’s delegation stated: “We deeply regret the fact that the assembly has voted for a country that will simply further politicise the work of the EB,” saying it opposed “politicisation of the work of the WHA and of the WHO as a whole.” There was further acrimony at the gathering after the United States said it regretted the extension of a place for North Korea after it was put forward by South East Asia. Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine has not publicly acknowledged launching attacks against targets inside Russia. The Ukrainian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday, Reuters reported. In the Tver region, which lies just north-west of Moscow, two drones attacked a station that serves the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline, one of the world’s largest oil pipelines, the Kommersant newspaper said. The Tver local council said that a drone had crashed near the village of Erokhino, about 500 km (310 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The Telegram channel Baza, which has good sources among Russia’s security services, said the drones attacked a station serving the Druzhba pipeline. Preliminary operations have already begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of de-occupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines. “The intensity is increasing, but it will take quite a long period of time,” he added, predicting that as the counteroffensive gathered momentum, there would be more incursions into Russia by Russian rebel groups, such as the raid in Belgorod region earlier this week. On Saturday the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, raised expectations that a major operation could be imminent by declaring on social media: “The time has come to take back what’s ours.” Zaluzhnyi’s declaration on the Telegram messaging app was accompanied by a cinematic video showing heavily armed Ukrainian soldiers preparing for battle to a soundtrack of ominous music and a narrator reciting a prayer calling for strength to “annihilate” Ukraine’s enemies. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported. More on the expulsion of German diplomats from Russia (see 12:53pm). Germany has said more than 100 employees will be withdrawn after Moscow imposed limits on the numbers allowed to work at diplomatic missions in Russia, a source with the German foreign ministry said on Saturday. “This limit, set by Russia for the beginning of June, requires a major cut in all areas of our presence in Russia,” the source said, Reuters reports. Those affected included teachers, as well as other employees of schools and the Goethe Institute, and was necessary to maintain the right balance for Germany’s diplomatic presence, said the person, who described the number affected as at least 100. Relations between Russia and Germany, which used to be the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas, have broken down since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the west responded with sanctions and weapons supplies. The source called the limit, announced in April, “unilateral, unjustified and incomprehensible”. The person declined to say what the limit imposed by Moscow was. The number of German employees leaving was earlier reported by Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung. Russia’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year. The German foreign ministry criticised Russia’s move, calling it an “unilateral, unjustified and incomprehensible decision”. The expulsions will affect several hundred German state employees, including teachers and staff of the Goethe Institute, which promotes German culture and language abroad, the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported. It comes in response to the reduction of the presence of Russian intelligence services in Germany earlier this year. A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Matsuno also condemned Russia’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying it would further inflame the situation and that Japan would never accept “Russia’s nuclear menace, let alone its use”. Russia’s foreign ministry said it was assessing the implementation of Japan’s sanctions on its national security and economy and would not leave Tokyo’s “illegitimate actions” unanswered, Reuters reported. The ministry also took issue with Matsuno’s casting of Russia as engaging in “nuclear blackmail”. Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted. He said: When the Ukraine conflict is over and Ukraine has restored its borders, as it must, we will have a damaged, vindictive, and brutal Russia, whose means of harming us is through air attack, missile attack and subsurface attack. Sir Mike is set to step down next month after four years at the top of the RAF. He added: But it also demonstrates that this is more than about just one person. There is a whole structure and a hierarchy behind Putin. So even if Putin was to disappear off the stage, there are countless others that could replace him that could be as equally as brutal and vicious to their own people and to neighbouring states. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. “Yesterday and today there have not been any active battles – neither in the city nor on the flanks,” she wrote, adding that Moscow’s troops were instead shelling the outskirts and approaches to Bakhmut. “The decrease in the enemy’s offensive activity is due to the fact that troops are being replaced and regrouped,” Maliar said. “The enemy is trying to strengthen its own capabilities.” She added that Ukrainian troops “firmly hold” the heights overlooking Bakhmut from the north and south, as well as a portion of the outskirts, but have not advanced during the past two days to focus on “other tasks”. Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine. If it supplied the missiles, Germany would be following in the footsteps of Britain, which earlier in May became the first country to publicly provide Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles. The United States has so far declined to supply Ukraine with the 297-km range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles amid concerns that Ukraine could use them to strike inside Russia’s internationally recognised borders. Ukraine has been asking for months for these kind of weapons, but support from western allies has focused on shorter-range weapons Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move. Biden said on Friday he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has moved ahead with a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reported. The US state department denounced the Russian nuclear deployment plan. “It is the sovereign right of Russia and Belarus to ensure their security by means we deem necessary amid of a large-scale hybrid war unleashed by Washington against us,” Russia’s embassy in the United States said in a statement. “The measures we undertake are fully consistent with our international legal obligations.” The US has said the world faces the gravest nuclear danger since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis because of remarks by Vladimir Putin during the Ukraine conflict, but Moscow says its position has been misinterpreted. Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. Iran initially denied supplying Shahed drones to Russia but later said it had provided a small number before the conflict began. Ukraine says the drones have played a major role in Russia’s attacks on cities and infrastructure. “The Ukrainian president’s repeat of delusional claims against the Islamic Republic of Iran is in line with the anti-Iranian propaganda and media war aimed at attracting as many arms and financial aid as possible from western countries,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement carried by Iranian media. Ukraine, Kanaani said, has been refusing to allow an independent investigation into these claims. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. He had extensively reported on mass protests against Lukashenko and refused to leave the Moscow-allied country after authorities unleashed an historic crackdown on dissent. Belarus’s supreme court said in a statement that the sentence was “left unchanged”. The verdict has come into force. Poczobut, 50, who stood trial in his home city of Grodno, near the Polish border, was found guilty of taking part in “actions harming national security” and “inciting hatred”. Poland, Belarus’s western EU-member neighbour, has condemned the trial and called for his release. After Poczobut’s appeal was rejected, Warsaw said it would impose new punitive measures against Lukashenko’s regime next week. The Polish interior minister, Mariusz Kaminski, said on Twitter: On Monday, I will announce the decision to add to the sanctions list several hundred representatives of the Lukashenko regime responsible for political repression, including repression against Poles living in Belarus. Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counter-offensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian defence ministry’s intelligence directorate said Russian forces would soon shell the plant and then announce a radiation leak. This would force an investigation by international authorities, during which all hostilities would be stopped. The directorate’s statement, posted on Telegram, did not provide any proof. It said Russia had disrupted the planned rotation of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who are based at the plant. The agency, which frequently posts updates on the plant, has made no mention of any disruption. Last week witnesses said Russian military forces had been enhancing defensive positions in and around the plant ahead of the counter-offensive. Ukraine is ready to launch its much-anticipated counteroffensive against Russian forces, a senior Ukrainian official has told the BBC. The broadcaster reported that Oleksiy Danilov would not name a date but said an assault to retake territory from President Vladimir Putin’s occupying forces could begin “tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week”. He said Kyiv had “no right to make a mistake” on the decision because it was an “historic opportunity” that “we cannot lose”. As secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Danilov is at the heart of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s de facto war cabinet. Danilov also told the BBC he was “absolutely calm” about Russia beginning to deploy nuclear weapons to Belarus, saying: “To us, it’s not some kind of news.” The Wagner mercenary group’s forces have probably begun to withdraw from some of their positions around the devastated Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and are likely to be used for other offensive operations in the Donbas region, according to British intelligence. The UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update that Wagner’s owner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, had said the withdrawal had begun and positions were being transferred to Russian defence ministry forces. Kyiv corroborated Wagner’s rotation out from the city’s outskirts. The UK ministry said in its update, posted on Twitter, that forces of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic had probably entered the eastern Ukrainian city since Wednesday to start “clearance operations”. Bakhmut has been the scene of the war’s longest and bloodiest battle. The ministry said: Ukrainian forces had taken 20 square kilometres of Bakhmut’s flanks as of 16 May. The rotation out of Wagner forces is likely to continue in controlled phases to prevent collapse in pockets around Bakhmut. Despite Prigozhin’s ongoing feud with the Russian MOD [ministry of defence], Wagner forces will likely be used for further offensive operations in the Donbas following reconstituting its forces. US president Joe Biden has said he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has moved ahead with its plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, while the European Union has condemned the plan. Reuters reports that the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said: This is a step which will lead to further extremely dangerous escalation. Russia signed a pact with Belarus on Thursday about the storage of the warheads, at a facility due to be finished in just over a month. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said later that the relocation of some of the weapons had already begun. Borrell said the agreement contravened multiple international agreements. We call on Russia to abide by these commitments. The Belarusian regime is an accomplice in Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. Borrell said any attempt “to further escalate the situation will be met by a strong and coordinated reaction”. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton and here’s an overview of the latest. The European Union has condemned Russia’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in neighbouring Belarus, while US president Joe Biden says he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has already begun moving ahead with the plan. More on that story soon. In other news: The death toll from a Russian missile attack on an outpatient clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has risen to two, with 30 people wounded, according to media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “Russian terrorists once again confirm their status of fighters against everything humane and honest.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to visit Finland, Sweden and Norway from this Monday to deepen cooperation on top national security and economic issues, the US state department has said. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland has joined Nato, with Sweden’s bid to join awaiting ratification from Hungary and Turkey.

The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and former US president Donald Trump discussed Ukraine and “the vital importance of Ukrainian victory” on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said in a phone call with his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, that Russia is open to dialogue over Ukraine. Lula tweeted that he had reiterated Brazil’s willingness to talk to both sides of the war in Ukraine but declined Putin’s invitation to visit. Russia has blamed Kyiv for dozens of strikes on its southern Belgorod region. Its governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the Ukrainian military was responsible for artillery, mortar and drone attacks across the region over 24 hours but reported no casualties. In a rare attack on the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, east of Crimea, two drones damaged buildings in the city centre, officials said. In the neighbouring Rostov region, the governor said a Ukrainian missile had been shot down near Morozovsk, where there is a Russian airbase. Canada will donate 43 AIM-9 missiles to Ukraine to help the country “secure its skies”, the national defence has said. “Canada’s support for Ukraine is unwavering,” said Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. The country also said it welcomed Ukraine’s application to join the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership (CPTPP). Moscow’s city court will hold a preliminary hearing next Wednesday in a new criminal case against the jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on charges including incitement to extremism. The Russian arms company Kalashnikov, maker of the world’s most widely used assault rifle, is launching a division for the production of kamikaze drones – a key weapon used in the Ukraine war. Ukraine said it shot down 10 missiles and 25 drones launched by Russia in overnight attacks on the capital of Kyiv, the city of Dnipro and eastern regions. Several drones and missiles hit targets in the Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, officials said on Friday. There was no immediate word of any deaths. The city of Donetsk has come under fire from Ukrainian forces, the Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said. As a result, he said, a young woman died and another was injured. Japan will place additional sanctions on Russia after the Group of Seven (G7) summit the country hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/12/centrica-and-edf-are-at-the-table-now-uk-ministers-must-strike-a-fair-electricity-price","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-12T18:23:48Z","webTitle":"Centrica and EDF are at the table – now UK ministers must strike a fair electricity price","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/12/centrica-and-edf-are-at-the-table-now-uk-ministers-must-strike-a-fair-electricity-price","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/12/centrica-and-edf-are-at-the-table-now-uk-ministers-must-strike-a-fair-electricity-price","fields":{"headline":"Centrica and EDF are at the table – now UK ministers must strike a fair electricity price","bodyText":"Centrica and EDF, the duo behind the UK’s current fleet of nuclear power stations, have read the political breezes, sensed the popular mood and come to the correct conclusion: they’re up for a negotiation with government to cap the price of electricity. So they should be, of course. Even if the size of windfall profits being collected by generators is currently unclear, nobody doubts the fact of outsized returns when current forward-selling contracts fall away. The wholesale price of electricity, absurdly, is tied to the price of gas, creating nonsensical outcomes in those corners of the generation market where input prices are virtually unchanged. One could, perhaps, be slightly nervous that Centrica and EDF have volunteered for duty so speedily. The companies aren’t charities and they’ll be looking for something for themselves – namely medium or long-term guarantees on prices. That worry, though, is really an argument for transparency when the deal-making begins. At this stage, willingness to come to the table is what matters. It’s up to ministers, if they’re really dead-set against new windfall taxes, to thrash out decent terms to protect the public purse. So where are the other corporate volunteers? Drax, as a biomass-based business, tends to be overlooked in the focus on nuclear, wind and solar generators, but it is in exactly the same lucky economic boat. Burning wood pellets to generate power is a lucrative business if you’re being paid as if you’re a gas generator. Witness the jump in Drax’s profits, and two-thirds improvement in the share price, since wholesale energy started to climb last autumn. Since Drax is also the beneficiary of stupendous support under current arrangements (thinktank Ember calculates that from 2012 until 2027, the company will have collected more than £11bn in government subsidies), it ought to have been the first company to say it will come to the table. Will Drax play ball? Aside from a few boiler-plate words about working in partnership with government, Drax on Monday was gloriously unclear about its readiness to negotiate. Not good enough. Get with the programme. Reasons to admire outgoing Serco CEO’s corporate rescue job Serco is one of those companies that is doomed never to enjoy popular acclaim and affection – or even, in some quarters, acceptance. That’s life. Nor is suspicion remotely surprising given that the outsourcing firm only emerged a few months ago from a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Serious Fraud Office related to past shenanigans with electronic tagging contracts for prisoners. There are, though, two strong reasons to admire the corporate rescue job performed by chief executive Rupert Soames, who on Monday announced his looming retirement (“outsourcing myself”, as he put it). The first is that Serco still exists. Back in 2014, survival wasn’t guaranteed. Aside from the scandal with tags, Soames inherited a £1.5bn annual loss and a chunk of contracts that made no commercial sense for the provider. The company was an operational and balance-sheet mess. Soames served up a £150m rights issue as an amuse bouche on day one, and made investors swallow a £550m thumper the following year. Both fundraisers were essentially acts of faith on the part of investors. Turnaround wasn’t quick, but the new strategic direction has been vindicated. Today’s Serco is a government-only contractor with a greater international spread (particularly in North America) and a bias towards defence. Progress from the 100p rights issue price to today’s 168p has been steady, rather than spectacular, but that is roughly what low-margin contractors should deliver: a touch of reliability. Investors have been much better off by owning Serco in the period than outsourcing twin Capita (let alone its cousin, the late and unlamented Carillion). Soames, 63, will be replaced by Mark Irwin, who seems to have been earmarked for succession for a while. One hopes the new man has digested the second lesson of the Soames era: speak plainly, acknowledge that outsourcing is controversial and be prepared to debate your critics. A few non-believers will never accept that public services should be delivered by private companies. The rest of us know that it is often a better way to deliver value for money – but we do still want maximum transparency from the providers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/13/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-region-hit-by-drone-strikes-putin-to-meet-turkish-president-erdogan-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T17:53:49Z","webTitle":"Russian forces will be ‘annihilated’ if Putin uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine, says senior EU official – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/13/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-region-hit-by-drone-strikes-putin-to-meet-turkish-president-erdogan-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/13/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-region-hit-by-drone-strikes-putin-to-meet-turkish-president-erdogan-live","fields":{"headline":"Russian forces will be ‘annihilated’ if Putin uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine, says senior EU official – as it happened","bodyText":"It is coming up to 9pm in Kyiv. That’s it from me, Joe Middleton, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog for today. Here is a round-up of everything you might have missed: The EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow that its forces would be “annihilated” by the west’s military response if president Vladimir Putin used nuclear weapons against Ukraine, AFP reports. At the opening of the Diplomacy Academy in Brussels, Borrell said: “Any nuclear attack against Ukraine will create an answer, not a nuclear answer but such a powerful answer from the military side that the Russian army will be annihilated.” The Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg, also said Russia faced “severe consequences” if it launched a nuclear assault on Ukraine. After retreating about 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely to be attempting to consolidate a new frontline west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end, where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Volodymyr Saldo, has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people. Just hours later Russia confirmed it would evacuate residents from Kherson. The Russian deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin said on state television: “The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country. We will provide everyone with free accommodation and everything necessary.” Ukraine’s state emergency service said a 12-year-old boy had been rescued after hours under rubble, after rockets hit a five-story residential building in Mykolaiv. Ukraine’s power grid has been “stabilised” after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said Thursday. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit Thursday in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” the foreign ministry said. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting on Thursday, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. The UN general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told Russian television Thursday that the vote was anti-Russian and that the west had used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries in order to force them to vote. He dismissed US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine currently had only 10% of what it needed in terms of air defences. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said that Russia would run out of supplies and armaments before the west did. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west that would ensure that the international community could continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Daniel Boffey reports for us from Kyiv: Moscow has announced it will evacuate Kherson after an appeal from the Russian-installed head of the region, raising fears the occupied city at the heart of the south Ukrainian oblast will become a new frontline. Marat Khusnullin, a Russian deputy prime minister, told state television on Thursday that residents would be helped to move away from the region in south Ukraine, which remains only partly occupied by invading troops due to a successful Ukrainian counterattack in recent months. “The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country,” Khusnullin said. The development followed a public request on the social media platform Telegram by Volodymyr Saldo, a former mayor of the port city, who was installed in April by the Russian forces as head of the wider Kherson region. Read more: Russia announces Kherson evacuation, raising fears city will become frontline Simon Smith is chair of the steering committee of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House, and they write for us to argue that Putin’s latest campaign stems from desperation: The Russian missile strikes on Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine over the past two days have opened a further deplorable chapter in Russia’s aggression against the country. Yet we need to resist seeing it as a shocking new moment in Russia’s assault. Each additional death brings new personal tragedy and heartbreak. But, in many respects, the wrecking of civilian lives and infrastructure is not new. It’s what millions of Ukrainians have been bravely living with for months. These strikes – and those that may well follow – are more of the same: entirely in line with the vindictiveness and indifference to civilian suffering with which Ukrainians have become familiar over eight years under Russian attack. Read more here: First ‘Nazis’, now ‘terrorists’: Putin’s latest campaign stems from desperation Andriy Yermak, the head of the Office of the Ukrainian Presidency, has tweeted a picture and footage of 20 newly-released prisoners of war. As we reported earlier, Ukraine and Russia said 20 soldiers on both sides had been released as part of a prisoner exchange, 40 soldiers in all. In a follow-up post, Yermak said that 14 of the returned soldiers were from the Ukrainian armed forces, four were from the territorial defence forces, one from the national guard and one from the navy. Russia said today it will evacuate residents from the occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson after a plea from a Kremlin-backed official, AFP reports. The Russian deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin said on state television: The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country. We will provide everyone with free accommodation and everything necessary. As we reported earlier Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the Kherson administration, posted a video on Telegram urging people to leave the region due to missile attacks. He directly addressed Russian authorities and asked them to “help organise this work.” The plea is a possible sign that Ukraine’s counteroffensive is continuing to make inroads in the south of the country. It comes just a day after Kyiv said it had retaken five settlements in Kherson. Kherson is one of the four regions in Ukraine that Moscow recently claimed to have annexed. Young Ukrainians from Kyiv are organising “repair together” weekends to help villages devastated by Russian occupation by cleaning up and rebuilding homes for free. Tetiana Burianova was traveling in Peru when the war broke out and rushed back to Ukraine to help out in any way she could. With her friends, she began collecting donations and organising repair events that now attract hundreds of young people from cities each weekend. The Guardian’s Christopher Cherry reports from a liberated village where he meets locals finding it impossible to forgive a brutal occupation, and volunteers determined to build a better Ukraine amid the ruin. Maksym Kozytsky, the head of the regional military administration in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, said today that Russia launched six rockets in the region. He said that Ukraine’s air defence forces shot down four of them, but two of the rockets hit a target. Kozytsky did not specify what was struck by the bombardment or if there were any casualties. In a post on his Twitter and Telegram accounts, he said: Today, the enemy launched 6 rockets on the territory of Lviv region. Unfortunately, there are two hits. Four rockets were shot down by soldiers of the “Zahid” PvK. Thanks to our air defence for the highly professional work. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow today that its forces would be “annihilated” by the west’s military response if president Vladimir Putin uses nuclear weapons against Ukraine, AFP reports. At the opening of the Diplomacy Academy in Brussels, Borrell said: Putin is saying he is not bluffing. Well, he cannot afford bluffing, and it has to be clear that the people supporting Ukraine and the European Union and the member states, and the United States and Nato are not bluffing neither. Any nuclear attack against Ukraine will create an answer, not a nuclear answer but such a powerful answer from the military side that the Russian Army will be annihilated. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg also said Russia faces “severe consequences” if it launches a nuclear assault on Ukraine. However the alliance has stopped short of threatening to use its nuclear arsenal to respond as non-member Ukraine is not covered by its self-defence clause. After retreating around 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely attempting to consolidate a new front line west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people. Ukraine’s state emergency service said a 12-year-old boy has been rescued after hours under rubble after rockets hit a five-story residential building in Mykolaiv. Ukraine‘s power grid has been “stabilised” after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said Thursday. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit Thursday in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” the foreign ministry said. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting on Thursday, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. The United Nations general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told Russian television Thursday that the vote was anti-Russian and that the west had used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries in order to force them to vote. He dismissed US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine currently only has 10% of what it needs in terms of air defences. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said that Russia will run out of supplies and armaments before the west does. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west that will ensure that the international community will be able to continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Ukraine and Russia say 20 soldiers on both sides have been released as part of a prisoner exchange, 40 soldiers in all, Associated Press reports. The Russian defence ministry said: As a result of the negotiation process on the exchange today, 20 Russian servicemen were returned from the territory of Ukraine controlled by the Kyiv regime. Ukraine also said its 20 soldiers have been freed from captivity in Olenivka, in the occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. They are now undergoing medical checkups. The head of the Ukrainian president’s office, Andriy Yermak, vowed on Telegram: We will bring everyone back. Philip Oltermann reports for us in Berlin: Europe’s largest economy is still a “teenager” when it comes to foreign security policy, the German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s chief of staff has said, asking for patience from western allies urging Germany to take a more proactive leadership in its support of Ukraine. “We are getting into a situation that Americans have known for decades: people want us to lead,” said Wolfgang Schmidt, a longstanding ally of Scholz who also serves as the political point of contact for the country’s intelligence agencies. “We are in the teenager years in that role,” he said, responding to criticism that Berlin has been slow to live up to the Zeitenwende or “epochal turn” on military and foreign policy Scholz had declared in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Read more: Germany still a ‘teenager’ on leading foreign security policy, says Scholz’s top aide These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. Earlier we reported that Moscow had summoned the ambassadors from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Russia and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures on the Nord Stream gas pipelines [see 10.52am]. The Reuters news agency is now carrying a statement from the Danish foreign ministry which says “the Russian wish to participate in the investigation of the Nord Stream leaks has been brought up through diplomatic channels in Moscow and Copenhagen.” However, Sweden’s foreign ministry appears to have told the media that it has not received any summons. At the same time, the Russian president’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said, according to reports from Russian agency Interfax, that arrests have been made after an attempt to attack the TurkStream pipeline: Some forces, Putin gave hints about the possible origin of these forces, they encroached on the TurkStream as well. Saboteurs were taken, several people were arrested. They wanted to blow it up. On our territory, on land. The TurkStream pipeline runs from near Anapa in Krasnodar Krai to Kıyıköy in north-western Turkey. Interfax reports that earlier in October, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said that Ukrainian authorities were trying to undermine a section of the pipeline. Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, has posted images of a visit to the city by Harjit Sajjan, who is Canada’s minister for international development. Lviv was one of the cities whose electrical infrastructure was attacked by Russia earlier in the week. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people, Agence France-Presse reports. In a video posted to Telegram, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the Kherson administration, said: We suggested to all people of the Kherson region to, if they wish, leave to other regions to protect themselves from missile hits. In addressing the leadership of the country [Russia], I ask you to help organise this work. He added: We, the people of the Kherson region, know that Russia does not abandon its own. Saldo said the region was being hit by an increasing amount of rocket attacks bringing “serious damage”, in signs that Ukraine’s counteroffensive was continuing to made progress. His warning comes just a day after Kyiv said it had retaken five settlements in the Kherson region. Kherson is one of the four regions in Ukraine that Moscow recently claimed to have annexed. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting today, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. “The topic of a Russian-Ukrainian settlement was not discussed,” RIA cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit today in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. Agence France-Presse reports that the Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement on Telegram: The Ukrainian armed forces shelled Belgorod. There is damage at a residential apartment building on Gubkin street. Information about the victims is being detailed. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”. Gladkov added that shelling by Ukraine’s forces had landed near school grounds in a village called Krasnoye outside the main city of Belgorod, with students learning online from home. No one was reported injured or killed. Attending a Nato meeting, the UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said there was no risk that western allies would run out of arms supplies to aid Ukraine against Russia. “The UK-Danish joint-led international fund is all about placing orders in a manufacturing space to make sure that we can go on between 2023, 24, and keep going on,” Wallace said today. He added that the UK would provide Ukraine with air defence systems that would complement US-provided systems. Ukraine faced a barrage of missile strikes earlier this week, damaging civilian infrastructure and knocking out electricity supplies in some cities AFP reports that Ukraine‘s power grid has been “stabilised” after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said today. The head of Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, said on Facebook: The introduction of scheduled emergency blackouts is currently not being planned ... This became possible, first of all, thanks to the fact that Ukrenergo and Oblenergo experts stabilised the energy supply in all regions of Ukraine. We withstood what was probably the largest missile attack on energy infrastructure in history. Whether there will be [supply] restrictions in the future depends primarily on whether there will be new shelling and destruction. Russia has blitzed Ukraine with missiles this week, in attacks that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said were retaliation for a deadly explosion at a Crimea bridge. As we previously reported, Ukrainian officials said that 40 towns and cities in the country had been targeted by Russian forces in the past 24 hours. As well as Putin’s idea for a gas hub, detailed in the post below this one, the Russian president and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, also discussed nuclear power. Meeting Putin at the start of a regional summit in Kazakhstan, Erdoğan mentioned Russia’s construction of Turkey’s first nuclear power plant, which Ankara hopes to open next year, AFP reports. Erdoğan raised the idea of Russia building a second nuclear power plant in northern Turkey. The Turkish president also defended Ankara’s booming trade ties with Moscow. The US and the EU are piling pressure on Turkey to comply with sanctions they imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. But Erdoğan has refused, offering the Nato member Turkey as a neutral venue for possible truce talks, and approving a range of agreements that have seen the value of exports to Russia more than double in recent months. Russian president Vladimir Putin floated the idea of a major gas hub in Turkey during talks with his counterpart Recep Tayip Erdoğan today. Putin told Erdoğan at a meeting in Kazakhstan: Turkey has turned out to be the most reliable route for deliveries today, even to Europe. We could consider the possibility of creating a gas hub in Turkey for supplies to other countries. The Russian president added: In the course of the work of this hub, which we could create together, of course, it would also be a platform not only for supplies, but also for determining the price, because this is a very important issue - the issue of pricing. Today, these prices are sky-high; we could easily regulate at a normal market level, without any political overtones. Putin suggested on Wednesday that Russia could create a major gas hub in Turkey by redirecting supplies intended for the damaged Nord Stream undersea pipelines, reports Reuters. Swedish and Danish authorities are investigating the blasts as acts of sabotage but have not yet said who they believe was responsible. In the televised exchange between the two leaders, Erdoğan did not comment on the gas hub idea. This graphic shows the location of the Russian missiles that struck 40 Ukrainian towns and cities today, according to officials. Ukraine‘s Armed Forces General Staff said that in the past 24 hours more than 40 settlements were hit by Russian shelling. In response Ukraine‘s air force carried out 32 strikes on 25 Russian targets. The mayor of the port city of Mykolaiv, Oleksandr Senkevich, said in a social media post that the southern city was “massively shelled”, reports Reuters. Young Ukrainians from Kyiv are organising ‘Repair Together’ weekends to help poor villages devastated by Russian occupation by cleaning up and rebuilding homes for free. Tetiana Burianova was traveling in Peru when war broke out, and rushed back to Ukraine to help out in any way she could.

The Guardian’s Christopher Cherry reports from a liberated village where he meets locals finding it impossible to forgive a brutal occupation, and volunteers determined to build a better Ukraine amid the ruin. Estonia has confirmed a new military aid package for Ukraine that will include winter gear, equipment and ammunition. Prime minister Kaja Kallas confirmed the additional support in a tweet today. Kallas added: Let us all speed up our help, so Ukrainians can free their territories. This is the way to peace. Estonia, who share a border with Russia, have already provided Kyiv with more than €220 million (£192,479,486) in military assistance and have called for richer Western nations to increase weapons supplies to the country. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, have started talks in Astana, Kazakhstan. The duo are in the country for the the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia. The meeting is taking place on the sidelines of the regional summit, and the Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov previously suggested the Erdoğan could propose ideas for peace. Philip Oltermann reports for us from Berlin: The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has accused Vladimir Putin of waging “a crusade against our way of life”, in a shift of rhetoric days after heavy Russian missile strikes hit major Ukrainian cities. “They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade,” Scholz said in a video address to a summit of European socialist, liberal and green politicians and thinkers in Berlin. “A crusade against liberal democracy, a crusade against the rules-based international order, a crusade against freedom and progress, a crusade against our way of life,” he added. Read more: Putin’s war on Ukraine part of crusade against liberal democracy, says Scholz Ukraine’s state emergency service has said it is actively searching for people trapped under rubble after a Russian strike on Mykolaiv. In a statement on Thursday, it said: “Rockets hit a five-storey residential building. As a result, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest – under rubble.” A 12-year-old boy has been rescued from the site but there are thought to be at least seven others trapped. After retreating around 20km to the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely to be attempting to consolidate a new frontline west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence.

The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Tass, the Russian state news agency, in an interview on Thursday. Turkey’s aim is to stop the bloodshed in the Russia-Ukraine war as soon as possible despite hurdles, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told a regional summit in Kazakhstan. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Thursday the war in Ukraine was part of a broader movement against the west by Russia. He said: “Vladimir Putin and his enablers have made one thing very clear: this war is not only about Ukraine. They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade, a crusade against liberal democracy.” The Russian state-owned Tass news agency is reporting that officials at Russia’s nuclear power station operator Rosenergoatom have begun the process of transitioning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) to Russian processes, in particular “the storage system for spent fuel of the Russian Federation”. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Joe Middleton will be here shortly. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” Reuters reports the foreign ministry said. European nations have suggested the only possible cause of the ruptures to the pipelines was sabotage, with only a limited number of state actors suspected of being capable of such an operation. Two quotes this morning underscore the diplomatic gulf between the rhetoric of western leaders and Russia. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has this morning said the war in Ukraine is part of a broader movement against the west by Russia. Reuters quotes him saying: “Vladimir Putin and his enablers have made one thing very clear: this war is not only about Ukraine. They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade, a crusade against liberal democracy.” Meanwhile, Tass news agency is reporting the words of Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. He has told Russian television that the west used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries so an anti-Russian resolution on “referendums” in the occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions was adopted at the session of the UN general assembly. Tass report Lavrov also said that US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote were false. Here is the clip of the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, explaining that procurement processes are in place among allies in the west that he says will ensure that the international community will be able to continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has issued its latest situation map of how it sees developments on the ground in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine has only 10% of what it needs in terms of air defences. The president was speaking in a question and answer session with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Reuters has reported. Zelenskiy also said diplomacy was not possible with leaders who did not respect international law. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, has posted to Telegram to report that the city of Orikhiv has been targeted, killing one person. He writes: The city of Orikhiv is once again the target of the enemy. The occupier destroyed residential buildings along the central street and in a residential neighbourhood with a massive, multi-hour shelling of a small, peaceful town. The enemy took the life of a resident of the village. In addition, we have 9 wounded from Orikhov and 1 from Preobrazhenka, 3 more in Stepnohirsk. Other objects of civil infrastructure and utility networks, homes in which people invested their whole lives were destroyed. We will rebuild everything as soon as we knock out the enemy from our land, but the main thing is to save human life. Zaporizhzhia is one of the four occupied regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex, despite not being fully in control of the territory. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said there “isn’t a risk” of the western supply of arms to Ukraine running out before Russia’s supplies are exhausted. He told Deborah Haynes, the defence and security correspondent of Sky News: There isn’t a risk because unlike Russia, who has already isolated itself and we saw that yesterday at the United Nations vote, they need a supply chain. Large parts of the supply chain were not in Russia. They came from all over the world, including in Europe, including indeed even in Ukraine, some of their supply chain was in Ukraine. We have the ability to refurbish or indeed manufacture a new supply chain which is what we are doing right now. The UK-Danish joint-led international fund is all about placing orders in a manufacturing space to make sure we can go on in 2023, 2024 and keep going on. The state emergency service of Ukraine has issued this image of the target of a strike in Mykolaiv. In the UK, the foreign secretary James Cleverly has been doing the morning media round. So far his interviews have entirely been dominated by domestic issues. However, on Sky News he did mention the vote in the UN, telling viewers that domestic problems were being “amplified by Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine.” He went on to say: We need to help Ukrainians defend their country. We saw in the vote in the United Nations last night, we’ve got an international coalition of condemnation against Russia in support of Ukraine. The Russian state-owned Tass news agency is reporting that officials at Russia’s nuclear power station operator Rosenergoatom have begun the process of transitioning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) to Russian processes, in particular “the storage system for spent fuel of the Russian Federation”. It quotes Renat Karchaa, adviser to the general director of Rosenergoatom, saying: “The process of switching to the Russian system has already been launched.” He added: “This implies a number of points, starting with documents, regulations and so on. It is clear that there will be a transitional period for each component. “While we are immersing ourselves in the process, we are simultaneously analysing all the processes and developing specific solutions, including those related to the storage of all nuclear materials.” Yesterday, Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, described the situation at the ZNPP as “deeply worrying” after the plant again lost external power due to Russian military action cutting supplies. Energoatom, the Ukrainian operator of the plant, also accused the Russian forces occupying it of blocking attempts to refuel the site’s diesel generators. The governor of Lviv, Maksym Kozytskyi, has said that “the day in our region passed without worries” in his latest update. He stated that 301 people arrived in the region on evacuation trains from the east of Ukraine, and that 547 travelled from Lviv oblast to Przemyśl in Poland on evacuation trains. Rodion Miroshnik, the self-styled ambassador to Russia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), has criticised the vote at the UN, saying developing nations had been forced to vote “at the point of an American gun”. He posted to Telegram: Yesterday’s vote at the special session of the UN General Assembly is a demonstration of the US’s ability to put pressure on and twist the arms of developing countries. The “scoreboard” only demonstrates who is not yet ready to resist American blackmail, and who they have not found leverage against. It has nothing to do with the true will of states and their peoples. But even with such a vote “at the point of an American gun,” countries with a population of half the world either voted against or abstained from voting for the American-Albanian resolution condemning Russia’s actions to recognise referendums in the LPR, Donetsk People’s Republic, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. The Russian Federation has announced that the occupied Ukrainian region of Luhansk is to be annexed, after staging widely-derided “referendums” in four regions. The LPR is only recognised as a legitimate authority by three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said it is actively searching for people trapped under rubble after a Russian strike on Mykolaiv. In a message on Telegram, the service said: One of the rockets hit a five-story residential building in one of the districts of the city. As a result, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest – under rubble. As of 8am, rescuers unblocked a twelve-year-old boy from under the rubble, who was handed over to doctors. According to preliminary information, there may be seven residents of the five-story building under the ruins of the building, with whom there is currently no communication. Rescuers are searching for them and analysing the destroyed structures. To provide assistance to the local population, volunteers of the Red Cross Society of Ukraine are working on the spot, emergency medical teams, law enforcement officers and emergency teams of the city are involved. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Turkey’s aim is to stop the bloodshed in the Russia-Ukraine war as soon as possible despite hurdles, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told a regional summit in Kazakhstan. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told the Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Tass cited Venediktov as saying: Kyiv is well aware that such a step would mean a guaranteed escalation to a World War Three. Apparently, that’s what they are counting on - to create informational noise and draw attention to themselves once again.” Venediktov also repeated a Russian position that the west, by helping Ukraine, indicated that “they are a direct party to the conflict”. After retreating around 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely attempting to consolidate a new front line west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. “In recent days, the Russian occupation authorities have likely ordered preparation for the evacuation of some civilians from Kherson,” the report adds. “It is likely that they anticipate combat extending to the city of Kherson itself.” Recently released satellite images show a close view of traffic and bridge repair work on the collapsed part of the Kerch bridge in Crimea. The images made available by Maxar Technologies are dated 12 October. An explosion on Saturday partially destroyed the strategic key bridge, built specifically on Putin’s orders and linking Crimea to Russia. Ukraine has not directly claimed responsibility for the attack. Dozens of Ukraine’s allies have pledged to send more military aid to Ukraine after more than 50 western countries met In Brussels on Wednesday. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of the sophisticated national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (Nasams) from the US. “A new era of air defence has begun in Ukraine,” Reznikov tweeted. “Iris-Ts from Germany are already here. Nasams are coming. This is only the beginning. And we need more.” The UK has said it will donate cutting edge air defence weaponry, capable of shooting down cruise missiles It did not say how many of the Amraam rockets would be sent to Ukraine, but said they would be used with Nasams. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said: “Russia’s latest indiscriminate strikes on civilian areas in Ukraine warrant further support to those seeking to defend their nation. So today I have authorised the supply of Amraam anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine. These weapons will help Ukraine defend its skies from attacks and strengthen their overall missile defence alongside the US Nasams.” France has also promised radar and air defence systems in the coming weeks while Canada said it would provide artillery rounds and winter clothing. The Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, wrote in a letter to parliament that her government would be donating €15m (£13m) worth of air defences to Ukraine. US president Joe Biden said the vote sent a “clear message” to Moscow. “The stakes of this conflict are clear to all, and the world has sent a clear message in response – Russia cannot erase a sovereign state from the map,” he said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was “grateful to 143 states that supported the historic UNGA [United Nations general assembly] resolution”, tweeting: “The world had its say – [Russia’s] attempt at annexation is worthless and will never be recognised by free nations.” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said the vote showed international unity against Russia and repeated that Washington would never recognise the “sham” referendums. The vote “is a powerful reminder that the overwhelming majority of nations stand with Ukraine, in defence of the UN Charter and in resolute opposition to Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine and its people,” he said in a statement. Before the vote, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said: “Today it is Russia invading Ukraine. But tomorrow it could be another nation whose territory is violated. It could be you. You could be next. What would you expect from this chamber?” The United Nations general assembly has overwhelmingly condemned Russia’s “attempted illegal annexation” of four Ukrainian regions, demanding that Moscow reverse course. Three-quarters of the 193-member general assembly – or 143 countries – voted on Wednesday in favour of a resolution that called Moscow’s move illegal, deepening Russia’s international isolation. Only four countries joined Russia in voting against the resolution – Syria, Nicaragua, North Korea and Belarus. Thirty-five countries abstained, including Russia’s strategic partner China, together with India, South Africa and Pakistan. The rest did not vote. The resolution adopted on Wednesday declares that Moscow’s actions violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, are “inconsistent” with the principles of the UN charter, and “have no validity under international law and do not form the basis for any alteration of the status of these regions of Ukraine.” It demands that Russia “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.” It also supports “the de-escalation of the current situation and a peaceful resolution of the conflict through political dialogue, negotiation, mediation and other peaceful means” that respect Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and internationally recognised borders. Russian president Vladimir Putin is set to meet his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on the sidelines of a regional summit in Kazakhstan later today. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said the Turkish president may propose ideas for peace, hinting that “a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us” while speaking to reporters on Wednesday. Now many say that the Turks are ready to come up with other initiatives in the context of the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict. There are reports in the press that the Turkish side is putting forward specific considerations in this regard, I do not exclude that Erdogan will actively touch on this topic during the Astana contact. So a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us.” As we await more details on the reported drone strike on Kyiv region this morning, the southern city of Mykolaiv has also reported being hit by a barrage of missiles overnight. “A five-storey residential building was hit, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest – under rubble. Rescuers are working on the site,” mayor Oleksandr Senkevich said in a Telegram post just before 4am local time, adding the southern city was “massively shelled”. After the first night, Mykolaiv was massively shelled. A five-story residential building was hit. The two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest - under rubble. Rescuers are working on the spot.” Russian forces have reportedly struck the Kyiv region with kamikaze drones, according to local officials and media reports. Kyiv regional governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, issued an update via his official Telegram channel just after 6am local time, saying: We have attacks on one of the communities of the region. Previously - an attack of kamikaze drones. Rescuers are already working.” Kuleba urged residents to stay in shelters. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of president Zelenskiy’s office, also reported that critical infrastructure facilities were hit by drone strikes in the region. Another attack by kamikaze drones on critical infrastructure facilities.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next few hours. Russian president Vladimir Putin is set to meet his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on the sidelines of a regional summit in Kazakhstan later today. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said the Turkish president may propose ideas for peace, hinting that “a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us” while speaking to reporters on Wednesday. We are also receiving reports that the Kyiv region has been hit by drone strikes early this morning with Zelenskiy’s office reporting critical infrastructure facilities being struck. Here’s a rundown of all the latest major developments over the past 24 hours. The United Nations general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. A Russian nuclear strike would “almost certainly” trigger a “physical response” from Ukraine’s allies and potentially from Nato, a senior Nato official has said. Any use of nuclear weapons by Moscow would have “unprecedented consequences” for Russia, the official was quoted by Reuters as saying. The US will need to deter two major nuclear weapons powers for the first time, the Biden administration has warned. Washington’s new national security strategy (NSS) depicts China as the most capable long-term competitor, but Russia as the more immediate, disruptive threat, pointing to its nuclear posturing over Ukraine. “Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning,” the strategy blueprint reads. Putin will meet Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in what is likely to be a “very interesting” meeting in Kazakhstan on Thursday, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. Ukraine’s army boasted of territorial gains near the strategically vital southern city of Kherson on Wednesday. Five settlements in the Beryslav district in the north-east of the Kherson region – Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone – were said to have been taken from Russian forces over the day. Nato allies delivered new air defence systems in the wake of Russia’s recent missile attacks across the country. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of sophisticated National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (Nasams) from the US. France has promised radar and air defence systems in the coming weeks while Canada said it would provide artillery rounds and winter clothing and Britain pledged to donate Amraam anti-aircraft missiles capable of shooting down cruise missiles. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi had warned earlier that the loss of off-site power at the facility, Europe’s largest, was “deeply worrying”. Ukrainians are being reduce their electricity consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. Prime minister Denys Shmyhal appealed to citizens and businesses to reduce power consumption from 5pm to 10pm by 25%. “This is a necessity and this is our contribution to the victory. After all, it depends on each of us how we will get through this winter,” he said. The European Commission will next week present plans to mitigate soaring energy costs. Energy commissioner Kadri Simson told reporters on Wednesday that the commission would bring forward a proposal that includes joint gas purchases by 2023. By harnessing the bloc’s collective purchasing power, she said, the EU could “avoid member states outbidding each other on the market” and thus “driving up” prices. Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, Putin said in an address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas. There is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity, Alexei Miller said, adding that gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/30/uk-isolated-as-eu-agrees-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-30T14:41:19Z","webTitle":"UK isolated as EU agrees windfall tax on energy firms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/30/uk-isolated-as-eu-agrees-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/30/uk-isolated-as-eu-agrees-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms","fields":{"headline":"UK isolated as EU agrees windfall tax on energy firms","bodyText":"EU energy ministers have agreed to levy windfall taxes on energy companies’ profits, and to cut electricity use, but remain at loggerheads over proposals to cap the price of gas. Meeting in Brussels on Friday, the bloc’s 27 energy ministers signed off on proposals to levy a “solidarity contribution” on fossil fuel producers that have benefited from soaring energy prices. Revenues of renewable energy and nuclear power companies will be capped in response to the “unexpectedly large financial gains” made in recent months, as a result of their profits being linked to the price of expensive gas and coal, according to an EU statement. The measures, which together could raise €140bn (£123bn) to help lower consumer bills and fund the switch to green energy across the EU, contrast with the British government’s approach. Liz Truss, the UK prime minister, has ruled out extending the £5bn energy tax introduced by the former chancellor Rishi Sunak. Unlike the UK, the EU is also moving ahead with plans to reduce demand for energy. Ministers agreed on a voluntary target to cut electricity use by 10% and a mandatory energy savings target of 5% during peak hours. The mandatory peak hours target was deemed necessary to avoid power being simply moved from most to least efficient countries in the EU’s shared electricity market. The 10% cut in electricity use is meant to be achieved between 1 December and the end of March. A 15% voluntary target for cutting gas consumption over the winter was agreed in July. EU officials said if the demand-reduction plans were successful, governments would earn less than the estimated €140bn from windfall taxes, but consumers would benefit from lower bills. The emergency measures were agreed after a 37% decline in gas supplies from Russia to the EU between January and August, following the invasion of Ukraine. The risks to EU energy supply were further exposed this week when four leaks were found in two Nord Stream gas pipelines, believed by EU leaders to be acts of sabotage. Despite the consensus on a windfall tax and energy savings, ministers remain divided over plans to cap the price of gas. France, Italy, Spain and Poland were among 15 countries this week urging the European Commission to table a price cap as “the one measure that will help every member state to mitigate the inflationary pressure, manage expectations and provide a framework in case of potential supply disruptions, and limit the extra profits in the sector”. The Czech Republic’s industry minister, Jozef Síkela, who chaired Friday’s meeting, called on the commission to table additional measures targeted at reducing gas prices as soon as possible. “The households and businesses need the help now. We are in the energy war with Russia and we need to act. Now means now … Now is not in a week and definitely not in a month,” he said. Germany, the Netherlands and EU officials, however, are sceptical about a price cap, fearing it could harm the EU’s ability to secure scarce supplies of liquified natural gas in a competitive global market. Critics also say the system would require an EU authority to allocate and ration gas to member states, a politically fraught task never done at EU level. Luxembourg’s energy minister, Claude Turmes, said capping the wholesale price of gas had risks. “What happens when the clearing is not happening? Who will then decide where gas goes? [Is the] European Commission to decide? … Look, I think this is a system that can be very, very difficult to administer.” The commission continues to favour capping the price of Russian gas, a measure that has the support of only the Baltic states and is unlikely to pass. Kadri Simson, the EU energy commissioner, said the commission was “ready to develop a temporary EU-wide measure to limit the price of gas in electricity generation”, which she described as a far-reaching step. “A wholesale gas price cap is a legitimate option,” she told reporters, “but it requires a radical intervention in the market which means several non-negotiable conditions have to be met before this cap will work.” One of those conditions, she said, would be a gas-savings target going beyond the 15% already set. Riina Sikkut, Estonia’s infrastructure minister, rejected suggestions that Europeans faced a choice between heating and eating. “We can’t forget that we are in a situation of war,” she said. “Ukrainians are paying with their lives. So we may temporarily pay higher bills or prices in the food store.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/31/hopes-for-power-and-purpose-from-an-energy-industry-in-flux","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-31T16:00:22Z","webTitle":"Hopes for power and purpose from an energy industry in flux","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/31/hopes-for-power-and-purpose-from-an-energy-industry-in-flux","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/31/hopes-for-power-and-purpose-from-an-energy-industry-in-flux","fields":{"headline":"Hopes for power and purpose from an energy industry in flux","bodyText":"A tall white rig punctures the Cornish skyline, offering a hint of a new industrial era at a site near Redruth, once a copper mining capital. This year, the first power produced by a geothermal plant in the UK is expected from a project three decades in the making. The United Downs project aims to produce constant low-carbon electricity for the grid, and heat for homes, from hot rocks. Geothermal energy is an established power source in volcanically active areas of the globe, often near tectonic plate boundaries. However, it can also be used in other areas if the rock temperature is high enough, and the rocks are permeable enough for water to circulate. The project is developed by Geothermal Engineering and has received funding from the EU and Cornwall county council. Its introduction to the electricity generation mix will come in a year which could prove defining for a British energy industry that has spent the past 12 months in crisis mode. Here’s what other changes and challenges the sector can expect in 2023: Renewed impetus for renewables The importance of renewable power sources was underlined in 2022. The invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring and left countries paying through the nose for gas to replace Russian supplies, and hit household and public finances. Expect a fresh focus on new renewable projects this year, in part as a result of the lifting of the ban on onshore wind in England. Meanwhile, Scotland’s largest offshore windfarm – the £3bn Seagreen project, a joint venture between SSE Renewables and France’s TotalEnergies – is expected to be fully operational by the summer. An even bigger windfarm, at Dogger Bank 80 miles off the north-east coast of England, should also deliver its first power by the summer. And another SSE project, Coire Glas, is taking shape: it will be the first large-scale pumped hydroelectric storage scheme for more than 30 years and should provide a significant backup when wind and solar power are not available. It could also prove a crucial year for executives behind the £18bn project to connect Britain with a huge wind and solar farm in the Sahara through an undersea cable. They hope to secure a “contract for difference” with government – meaning they would receive public subsidies to give them a fixed price for power – as the clock ticks on the project. Nuclear vision The £30bn Sizewell C nuclear power station development in Suffolk became emblematic of the political tumult of 2021 – as the planning decision on its future was repeatedly delayed, before eventually being given the green light by Boris Johnson. It then looked in doubt amid Liz Truss’s mini-budget chaos before the government announced a £700m cash injection which also eased out China General Nuclear. This year, bankers will hope to finally land other backers to complement developer EDF and the government in the project. Could British Gas owner Centrica commit to investment? Rolls-Royce will hope to gain some momentum behind its long-awaited small modular reactor programme. Fossil fuels hang on The role of polluting fuels in Britain’s energy mix was high on the agenda in 2022, as fossil fuel firms faced a windfall tax on their Ukraine-inflated profits but were asked to step in to ensure security of supplies this winter. The government is set to award 130 new licences for North Sea oil and gas exploration by the summer, although the move faces a legal challenge. The futures of the huge Cambo and Rosebank fields remain uncertain but could get the green light this year. Green campaigners will also hope to see more progress in the transition away from coal after the approval of the first new coalmine for three decades, in Cumbria, and deals to keep coal plants running this winter. Britain has committed to end the use of coal power by October 2024. Regulations revamp The biggest redesign of the electricity market in a generation began this year in the form of the Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (Rema). A key part of the work will be de-linking gas and electricity prices as Britain shifts towards renewable power. Green energy suppliers have bemoaned the link between the surging cost of natural gas, after the invasion of Ukraine, and high power prices. Policymakers are attempting to create a market better suited to a greater proportion of renewables, by improving grid connections for windfarms and battery storage sites. Significant proposals for reform are expected in 2023. Heavy industrial companies are hoping new regulations, designed to encourage investment in hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, are completed to ease the path to decarbonisation. Generation flex Industry watchers have long predicted that consumers could take a more active role in Britain’s energy network. This year saw the introduction of a National Grid scheme, first trialled by Octopus, which saw households paid to turn limit energy usage at peak times. And with electric vehicle ownership increasing, the potential is growing for drivers to play a part in storing and pushing power back to the grid with car batteries. Octopus’s bosses will hope it can keep pushing innovation in these areas while integrating Bulb, the bust energy supplier which it has acquired in the face of a legal challenge from rivals. Counting the cost The biggest unknown for the energy industry this year is how gas prices will fare. While prices have begun easing in recent weeks thanks to warmer than average weather, wholesale natural gas costs are forecast to remain high across Europe in 2023, with few cheap options to replace the huge volume of Russian fuel lost to the market. Those prices will affect the cost of the energy price guarantee, the government’s measure to protect households from huge bills, which becomes less generous from April. However, signs of a global recession could further pull down the price of oil and fuel. Ministers may feel the energy crisis is under control, but it looks far from over. • This article was amended on 4 January 2023. An earlier version referred to volcanic activity “near to tectonic plates”. However, plates cover the surface of the earth, so volcanic areas are on, rather than near, plates. It has been corrected to convey that geothermal resources are often found “near tectonic plate boundaries”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/06/ukraine-motivational-messaging-maintains-morale-as-winter-bites","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T13:47:55Z","webTitle":"Ukraine’s motivational messaging maintains morale as winter bites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/06/ukraine-motivational-messaging-maintains-morale-as-winter-bites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/06/ukraine-motivational-messaging-maintains-morale-as-winter-bites","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine’s motivational messaging maintains morale as winter bites","bodyText":"Adverts on Ukraine’s underground system carry motivational messaging: “Together to the victory”, “Bravery is carrying on” or “Just a bit more and it will get easier”. Psychologists are invited on to television shows almost daily to offer tips on how to manage anxiety and the breaks are filled with videos in support of the army. Positive messaging, mental health advice, and examples of how to “do your bit” are all part of the information ecosystem helping Ukrainians sustain their morale throughout the war. Experts say this partly top-down, partly organic approach will play a significant role in supporting Ukrainians through what is likely to be a punishing winter. Ukrainian TV channels are running a series of adverts on how people can save energy amid government pleas for consumers to reduce usage. Under the slogan “The rules of a warm country”, one video advises people to use alternative methods to keep warm, including using hot water bottles and cats, as well as getting together with neighbours. There are also several segments a day featuring Ukrainians across the country demonstrating how they have prepared for winter. One man recently interviewed said in the event of no electricity or gas, he would pitch a tent inside his flat and sleep in a sleeping bag. Breathing inside a small tent, he said, will maintain the heat better than a room. On social media, Ukrainians are sharing infographics on which appliances use the most electricity and videos of the recent trend of making candles-come-stoves for soldiers in the trenches. This winter, Ukraine is facing the frightening prospect of sub-zero temperatures with bouts of no electricity, water and even heating. For the last month, Russia has been targeting critical elements of Ukraine’s energy sector with a combination of missiles, rockets, and Iranian-supplied drones. On Monday alone, Russia targeted at least seven regional power stations and since then they have attacked at least another three, according to Ukraine’s authorities. Ukrainian repair workers and energy dispatchers have been quick to reconnect and reroute supplies and scheduled blackouts have been rolled out in several regions, including the capital, Kyiv, to stabilise the electricity grid. But Ukraine’s officials have warned that these short shutdowns are probably just a small taste of what’s to come. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the head of Ukraine’s state energy company, Ukrenergo, said this week that if the Russian attacks continued, “power cuts in Ukraine will become longer and longer”. Kudrytskyi said Ukrenergo could not repair the grid as quickly as it was being destroyed. According to him, “virtually all” major non-nuclear power stations in the country have been hit, including 30% of the substations. The head of Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said his office was preparing for the event that blackouts may last as long as two weeks. The news of yet more bad times ahead has, however, not made a discernible dent in the country’s morale. According to Volodymyr Kulyk, a leading professor of sociology, Ukrainians remain defiant and want to demonstrate that. “People increasingly perceive Russia as a genocidal actor … [and] are ready to sacrifice to remain free and remain themselves,” said Kulyk. “[Messages of defiance] are both stemming from people themselves and also disseminated centrally from the government, the media and influencers.” The top-down messages – particularly those from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the daily update from Ukraine’s general staff – play a therapeutic role for many Ukrainians, Kulyk said. “We need this news to know that everything is OK and there is no disaster with the Ukrainian army,” he said. All of the state agencies make their own motivational videos – the fire services, police, the ministry of defence, as well as the TV channels and private companies. “These societal adverts that show heroism, of course, make [people] proud,” said Ostapa, the head of Detector Media, a media-monitoring organisation. Psychiatrists and psychologists are regularly invited on Ukrainian TV to discuss how people can identify mental health problems in themselves and their loved ones. How to talk to children about the war is a particularly prominent topic. Oleh Chuban, the head of psychiatry at a leading medical university in Ukraine and a regular guest on TV, said he aimed to tell people that what they are feeling was normal. “The fact that people are worried and anxious, chopping firewood, buying up all the generators, is a normal reaction. Only an idiot wouldn’t react to someone telling them that there will be power, water and heating outages,” said Chaban. “People are saving themselves, just like during Covid 19.” “The media has a big influence [on people] so I try to give them optimism and explain their worries are natural and demonstrate that they living people with (functioning) emotions,” said Chaban. On Tuesday, Zelenskiy spoke to the nation stressing the need for perseverance. “Instead of overcoming poverty in their country, the Russian leadership spends everything not to admit what a historical mistake they made with this war against Ukraine,” he said. “Patience is needed to prove that the hope for the winter for Russian terrorists will not come true. I am sure we will get through this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/10/the-disastrous-bursting-of-ukraines-nova-kakhovka-dam-and-the-battle-that-is-to-come","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-10T18:16:25Z","webTitle":"The disastrous bursting of Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam – and the battle that is to come","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/10/the-disastrous-bursting-of-ukraines-nova-kakhovka-dam-and-the-battle-that-is-to-come","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/10/the-disastrous-bursting-of-ukraines-nova-kakhovka-dam-and-the-battle-that-is-to-come","fields":{"headline":"The disastrous bursting of Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam – and the battle that is to come","bodyText":"Four-and-a-half days after Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam burst, the longer-term scale of the flooding disaster is gradually becoming apparent. In the station at Mykolaiv, the first city inland, pensioner Olena Lysiuk, says she had no choice but to quit her apartment in Kherson, even though it was too high up to be flooded. “It’s not just that we don’t have any water, gas or electricity. We have also got used to not having those during the Russian occupation. But now the sewage doesn’t work. That’s the new problem,” Lysiuk says. Now she plans to stay in Mykolaiv with relatives, with the state having given her about 10,000 hryvnia (£215) in support. Vasyl Chornyi gets off an evacuation carriage from Kherson while the train is joined with another and lights a cigarette. The Inhulets river flooded part of his village, Fedorivka, 18 miles (29km) north-east of Kherson, and while his house wasn’t directly affected, he too was leaving because “we are fearing a pandemic”. “The cemetery is drowned, the sewers have been drowned,” Chornyi says, even claiming to have seen coffins floating downstream. “When the waters go down, there will be lots of dead fish, other decay. In Kherson the wells are spoiled. Outside toilets are flooded,” he says, and acknowledges that while the Russian occupation between March and November did not force him out, the flooding disaster has. Whole houses are being washed into the Black Sea. On Friday an intact roof ended up on a beach in Odesa, 130 miles away. Locals in the city have been told not to try to clean up the rubbish, reeds and other waterborne detritus amid concern that landmines, some made of light plastic, could be floating dangerously within. That though, leaves the clean-up to the already stretched state emergency services. Kyiv’s interior ministry counts 27 people missing so far, although the true figure is likely to be far higher, following a disaster that came at the most critical point in the war since Russian troops were repelled from Kyiv. A day earlier, on Monday, Ukraine started, albeit without any fanfare, its long awaited counter-offensive on which the future of the war, of Ukraine and perhaps even Russia, hinges. Then at 2.50am on Tuesday, cataclysm struck the Nova Kakhovka dam. Locals reported hearing a deafening explosion with the “sky turning to white” in the small hours. Subsequent seismic analysis by Norsar of Norway, relying on sensors in Romania, has so far borne that out, while US media report that spy satellites also detected a blast around that time. Experts add that it would have been very much harder to destroy the dam from outside, than to have blown it up from the inside. If it was Russia, as seems most likely, what motive could its forces have? One explanation is that it was an instinctive defensive response to the threat of an amphibious attack in Kherson oblast across the Dnipro, a fearful reaction to the possibility of a surprise strike by Kyiv across the country’s central, defining river. Certainly, a marine assault is now more difficult for Ukraine, and the building of a pontoon bridge across the widened Dnipro is all but impossible. But if there was an attempt to emulate Stalin’s destruction of the larger Zaporizhzhia dam in the face of the advancing German army in 1941, the consequences of Tuesday’s events would be borne largely by civilians, and paradoxically Russian soldiers, on the left, southern bank of the Dnipro, the side held by the invaders. A group of Russian anti-war groups reported that 1,842 residents in and around the flooded town of Oleshky, across the Dnipro river from Kherson, are “currently not allowed to leave by the Russian military” of which 338 are in need of urgent assistance with water and food supplies running dangerously short. The Red Cross has been prevented from reaching the area, prompting the groups to appeal on Saturday to the US government to use “diplomatic means” to ease the crisis. Nevertheless, it was the Russians who held the hydroelectric station perched on the top of the dam. Under the occupation Nova Kakhovka had long since stopped generating power and had been turned into a garrison, from which the Russians could fend off any attempt by Ukrainian forces to approach the dam from the right bank. There are other signs that Russia saw the dam as a chip in a military game, without clear regard for the consequences. The Russian occupiers had allowed water levels in the Kakhovka reservoir behind the dam to build up to a 30-year high, filling the reservoir with more than 18m cubic metres of water, the size of Utah’s Great Salt Lake. Also concerned was the Ukrainian power company that used to run the hydro plant before it was overrun. “At the end of September, beginning of October, the Ukrainian workers at the station spotted that the Russians brought a lot of explosive material inside,” said Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukrhydroenergo. “But later in October, the Ukrainian workers were sent away and it became a military headquarters for the Russians.” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told an online meeting with environmental activists on Thursday: “We warned the world about the mining of the dam and other facilities. It was obvious that Russia had an intent to cause disaster.” Another possibility has been raised by the publication by the Ukrainian security service on Friday of a recording of what it claimed was an intercepted conversation between two Russian soldiers, in which one reveals to the other that it was a sabotage unit from their own side that set off the explosion, and that the resulting devastation had been far greater than intended. “Our saboteur group is there. They wanted to cause fear with this dam. It did not go according to the plan. More than they planned,” the soldier said. The authenticity of the call is unverified and probably unverifiable. If authentic though, it adds weight to the screw-up version of history, that the intention had been to wash Ukrainian forces off the river islands which made up the no man’s land between the two banks, and the saboteurs got their calculations wrong. Whatever the motives, there is no doubt about the consequences. While the immediate attention in the past week has been on the human and environmental tragedy unfolding downstream, an even greater catastrophe may be looming upstream in the coming months and years. By the end of the week, the water level in the Kakhovka reservoir sank below 12 metres, entering what Ukrainian officials called the “dead zone”. That meant it was too low to feed the four Soviet-era canal systems that feed the entire region, particularly Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts and Crimea. Together those regions represent one of the world’s breadbaskets, and the Ukrainian agriculture ministry warned that, without those life-giving canals, they could become “deserts” as early as next year. The sinking water levels in the reservoir also threaten drinking water supplies to cities, towns and villages all along the course of lower Dnipro. And there is another threat, less certain but potentially even more catastrophic. The level of the Kakhovka reservoir is now well below the 13.3 metres required to reach the intake channel for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, about 125 miles upstream from the dam. Normally, water would be sucked up from the reservoir into spray ponds used to cool the six reactor cores and the spent fuel stored at the plant. The draining of the reservoir is not an immediate threat, because all six reactors at Zaporizhzhia had been shut down after the plant’s occupation by Russian forces and its transformation into a garrison and military depot. One of the reactors had been kept in “hot shutdown”, kept warmer than the others to help with heating to the adjacent town of Enerhodar. That has now been put on cold shutdown. The water needs of the plant are far less than when it was functioning. Furthermore, there is a sizeable cooling pond for emergencies. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) estimates that it contains enough water to keep cooling operations going for several months. Ukrainian officials from the Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, believe it is enough for several years. However, it emerged last week that studies commissioned by Energoatom after the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in 2011 found that, without the counteracting force of the waters of the Kakhovka reservoir on the other side, the dyke around the cooling pond could burst from the pressure of the water inside. Energoatom’s president, Petro Kotin, played down that scenario, and reassured Ukrainians there were other sources of water in an emergency to prevent a meltdown of the radioactive fuel at the plant. “These are mobile pumping units that can be deployed if necessary, and the last frontier is the use of underground drinking water wells,” Kotin said on Friday. The real threat, Kotin said, was that of deliberate sabotage by the plant’s Russian occupiers. If the Russians did indeed blow up the Kakhovka dam, it raises fears they could also blow up the Zaporizhzhia plant, regardless of the consequences that would almost certainly spill onto Russian territory. At present, the waters have hardly receded from their peak – and the situation is complicated by the fact that, after a one-day pause on Wednesday, Russian shelling and Ukrainian retaliation resumed. Two rescuers were wounded in the Ukrainian-held city on Saturday, emphasising the dangers, while the security situation was too serious for another group to brief the Observer on their latest emergency efforts. Islands in the Dnipro delta, previously occupied by the Russians, have been submerged, and drone footage shows that former shoreline settlements such as Hola Prystan are also inundated. A humanitarian disaster on the Russian-held left bank “would undoubtedly heighten the risk” of an outbreak of cholera or other intestinal infections, says Prof Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia and adviser to the World Health Organization. “Flooding could wash sewage into water extracted for drinking, which if not adequately treated could lead to a whole range of water-borne problems, of which the scariest is in cholera,” Hunter says. Cholera has not appeared in Ukraine so far, he adds, but the disease has a history of surfacing in and around wars, most recently in Syria. To avoid problems, Ukraine will help with medical surveillance, vaccinations and ensuring that when people get ill they can get good healthcare, he adds. Meanwhile, with terrible effect, the destruction of the Kakhovka dam raises the already enormous stakes riding on the Ukrainian counter-offensive. Already the challenge facing Ukrainian troops as they try to storm well-prepared Russian defensive lines was daunting, and pictures began to circulate on social media of the first losses of western armour, German Leopard tanks and US-made Bradley fighting vehicles. “With the exception of the US, no other western-style military can conduct sustained combined arms operations at scale. So Ukrainian forces are attempting to do something at the tactical level that no other European Nato member is currently capable of,” Franz-Stefan Gady, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote on Twitter. But now the flooding has deepened the crisis in Ukraine. The dramatic moments in the small hours of Tuesday morning mean the country is no longer just fighting a war, but also grappling what is almost certain to have been a human-made and entirely unnecessary environmental and humanitarian catastrophe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/18/ukraine-says-30-of-its-power-plants-destroyed-in-last-eight-days","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-18T17:00:27Z","webTitle":"Ukraine says 30% of its power plants destroyed in last eight days","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/18/ukraine-says-30-of-its-power-plants-destroyed-in-last-eight-days","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/18/ukraine-says-30-of-its-power-plants-destroyed-in-last-eight-days","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine says 30% of its power plants destroyed in last eight days","bodyText":"Nearly a third of Ukraine’s power stations have been destroyed by Russian attacks since Monday last week – prompting Nato’s secretary general to announce that new counter-drone defences would be delivered within days. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of engaging in “terrorist attacks” with its missiles and Iranian-made drones, while British ministers attended emergency meetings in Washington on how to counteract them. Zelenskiy tweeted: “Since Oct 10, 30% of Ukraine’s power stations have been destroyed, causing massive blackouts across the country.” Attacks on civilian infrastructure meant there was “no space left for negotiations with Putin’s regime”. The bombing is often inaccurate and civilians have been killed in residential buildings in Kyiv and other big cities. But enough have got through to cause problems for a power grid already short of generation after the Zaprorizhzhia nuclear power plant was shut down. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidential office, said energy infrastructure and power supply were targeted overnight in an eastern district of Kyiv, where two people were killed, and in the cities of Dnipro and Zhytomyr. “The situation is critical now across the country because our regions are dependent on one another … it’s necessary for the whole country to prepare for electricity, water and heating outages,” Tymoshenko told Ukrainian television. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said member countries would “step up” and deliver more air defences to help stabilise the situation. “Nato will in the coming days deliver counter-drone systems to counter the specific threat of drones, including those from Iran,” he said. Russia has been targeting Ukraine with a mixture of missiles and, more recently, Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones, rebranded as Geran-2 by the attackers. Although there are signs that Moscow is running short on guided missiles, it has acquired up to 2,400 of the drones, according to Ukraine, and is using them as cheaper substitutes to hit the energy targets and strike fear into civilians. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he did not have any information about their origin. “Russian equipment with Russian names is being used,” Peskov said. Ukraine, experts and western governments believe the Gerans are rebranded Shahed drones, identifiable by their distinctive delta wing shape and from an examination of fragments recovered from the ground. A western official, speaking on condition of anonymity in a briefing on Tuesday, said they believed Russia was “pursuing a deliberate strategy of attempting to destroy Ukraine’s electricity network”. It was “not in doubt”, the official said, “where these weapons were coming from”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he would ask Zelenskiy to cut diplomatic ties with Tehran – while presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak asked what Iran had got in return from Russia, speculating that it could be uranium, “nuclear technologies”, or some other guarantee. Reuters reported that Iran had promised to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles, in addition to more drones, citing two senior Iranian officials and two Iranian diplomats. Germany said that Iran should be punished with “further sanctions” after the recent spate of drone attacks. Its ambassador to the UK, Miguel Berger, said Tehran had helped Russia “terrorise civilians in Ukraine with their kamikaze drones” and there were “worrying reports” that Iran might sell missiles to Moscow. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, flew to Washington on Tuesday to discuss how to respond to Iran’s intervention, as officials briefed that a new air defence package for Ukraine was being prepared. A western official said a lot of colleagues within the western alliance were “looking at what the right package might be to support the Ukrainians”. Last week Germany delivered the first of four Iris-T air defence systems it had promised to supply Ukraine, but the US has been wary of strengthening Ukraine’s air force and defences for fear it would be seen as an escalation. Two “objects of critical infrastructure” were damaged in Kyiv on Tuesday, said the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and electricity and water supply in “many houses” in east Kyiv was “partially limited”. The mayor appealed to residents to conserve electricity by turning off air conditioners, electric kettles and microwaves, and said houses experiencing reduced water pressure should use water as “economically as possible”. All of Zhytomyr was without electricity and water after a double missile strike on an energy facility, said the mayor, Serhiy Sukhomlyn. Hospitals were running on backup power, he said. Russia said on Tuesday that its forces were maintaining strikes against military and energy infrastructure targets, and that it had used what it described as high-precision, long-range air- and sea-based weapons. The targets were “military command and energy infrastructure of Ukraine, as well as arsenals with ammunition and foreign-made weapons”, it said. “All assigned objects were hit,” it added. Klitschko said a fifth person, an elderly woman, had been found dead after a wave of drone attacks in the centre of Kyiv on Monday morning. She died after a residential building was hit by a drone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/oct/18/amol-rajan-interviews-greta-thunberg-review-she-is-doomed-to-the-pure-hell-of-arguing-with-people","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-18T19:15:03Z","webTitle":"Amol Rajan Interviews Greta Thunberg review – she is doomed to the pure hell of arguing with people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/oct/18/amol-rajan-interviews-greta-thunberg-review-she-is-doomed-to-the-pure-hell-of-arguing-with-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/oct/18/amol-rajan-interviews-greta-thunberg-review-she-is-doomed-to-the-pure-hell-of-arguing-with-people","fields":{"headline":"Amol Rajan Interviews Greta Thunberg review – she is doomed to the pure hell of arguing with people","bodyText":"What must it be like to be Greta Thunberg? To be, at 19 years of age, the most recognised climate crisis campaigner in the world, shouldering the burden of averting – or at this late stage, merely softening – the biggest calamity humanity has ever faced? What can that possibly feel like? At the end of Amol Rajan Interviews Greta Thunberg (BBC Two), the conversation becomes more personal and we get a few answers: how Thunberg doesn’t enjoy being stopped in the street and certainly doesn’t appreciate threats to her family; how she despairs at being told her presence reassures people about the future of the planet, because it implies they are outsourcing their individual responsibility to her. But a fundamental insight into Thunberg’s existence has already been provided by the previous half-hour of questions about her advocacy of “annual, drastic, immediate emissions cuts, on a scale unlike anything the world has ever seen”. Thunberg has sacrificed her youth to tackle the climate emergency, having realised that it demands a radical reimagining of our whole way of life. Now she is doomed to the pure hell of arguing with people who cannot conceive of that way of life changing. Rajan, who asserts in his introduction that Thunberg’s influence must be acknowledged “whether you admire her or despair of her”, spends large parts of the interview reflecting mainstream discourse on climate – which is to say, he risks sounding ignorant in order to give commonplace gotchas and canards an airing. The sport is in how efficiently Thunberg can knock down questions we should, by now, have moved beyond asking. Early on, she is pressed for an opinion on nuclear power and shale gas. Aren’t they important components of a strategy to hit net zero by 2050, as per the Paris Agreement? Thunberg does say that the former is too slow and the latter is, er, a fossil fuel and thus not a cracking idea, but stresses that her concern is driving awareness of the extent of the problem, not getting bogged down in hot-button issues: arguments about which bucket of water to use will dissipate once people agree that the house is on fire. Unskewing our priorities is also the rejoinder to Rajan’s question, steeped in conservative attitudes towards which expenditures are inevitable and which must be interrogated, about how we would “pay for” free public transport, a key Thunberg objective, during a “cost of living crisis”. Thunberg is presented with several versions of the same argument: we can’t do that, because it would cost money or be inconvenient in the short term. At a time when both main UK political parties have recently used the slogan “growth, growth, growth”, Thunberg’s contention that the endless pursuit of economic expansion might just be, you know, suicidal feels like listening to an intelligent alien who is beamed down to sort us out. Rajan’s question on the topic is remarkable: “Economic growth creates leisure time, it creates opportunities for new experiences – some of which will have a negative impact on the environment, but a lot of which people really enjoy. Flying is one of those … do you think flying should be illegal?” More credibly, Rajan asks how Thunberg can call capitalism a failed ideology, when life expectancy and infant survival rates in China and India have risen as those countries have commercialised. Delicately, Thunberg observes that the collapse of life-support systems, wars for resources and other likely effects of out-of-control global warming might soon cause those graphs to slope back down. It’s not all such a struggle. Thunberg often has a refreshingly unguarded response to daft statements: her reaction to Rajan sincerely intoning that “There is one individual looming over this debate – and that’s Elon Musk” is untrammelled giggling. And, in this extended format, Rajan has time to include more profound questions. An inquiry about whether the gap between what we’re doing and what we need to do is widening (yes) is valuable, as is a discussion about whether Thunberg ought not to encourage blanket cynicism towards politicians, and should consider going into politics herself. She counters that although politicians will ultimately implement the required action, public opinion will be what compels them to act, and protest is an effective way of amplifying that consensus. The politicians themselves then become irrelevant, and we can “reconsider what is politically possible” – the payment of reparations to poorer countries deeply affected by a changing climate they have done little to cause, to take the example Rajan puts forward of a demand that is absurdly unrealistic, might well become feasible. Her main point is that this needs to happen soon. We are desperately short of time, and Thunberg has given herself the task of communicating that urgency. As this programme shows, it is a terribly difficult job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2021/apr/22/israel-confirms-syrian-missile-landed-near-dimona-nuclear-reactor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-22T16:19:34Z","webTitle":"Israel confirms Syrian missile landed near Dimona nuclear reactor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/22/israel-confirms-syrian-missile-landed-near-dimona-nuclear-reactor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/apr/22/israel-confirms-syrian-missile-landed-near-dimona-nuclear-reactor","fields":{"headline":"Israel confirms Syrian missile landed near Dimona nuclear reactor","bodyText":"Israel has acknowledged that its air defences failed to intercept a missile fired from Syria overnight that traversed 125 miles of its highly protected airspace and landed near its secretive Dimona nuclear reactor. The surface-to-air missile was believed to have been fired by Syrian air defences against Israeli jets that were bombing a site near Damascus, but the path it flew initially led to speculation that Israel’s most sensitive site may have instead been a target. The defence minister, Benny Gantz, claimed the missile had landed in Israel as a result of errant Syrian anti-aircraft fire. In doing so he raised concerns about the effectiveness of his country’s vaunted air defence capabilities, which have been entrusted to counter such threats. Gantz said Israel’s anti-missile systems had attempted to intercept the SA-5 but were unsuccessful. “In most cases we achieve other results. This is a slightly more complex case. We will investigate it and move on,” he said The incident follows the publication of an analysis in an Iranian newspaper at the weekend that called for the Dimona reactor to be targeted to avenge an apparent Israeli sabotage operation at the Natanz nuclear site in Iran a fortnight ago. Syria is a staunch ally of Iran, and Iranian forces use Syrian territory to stockpile weapons to supply to its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah. However, despite hundreds of Israeli attacks targeting Iranian interests, Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, has remained reluctant to launch offensive attacks against Israel, fearing his war-ravaged country could be drawn into a broader conflict with a technically superior foe. Directly firing a large missile at Dimona could have been a trigger for such an escalation. Instead, Israeli officials claim that the impact of the missile was likely to have been inadvertent, and are now focusing on how its various defence systems failed to intercept it. The missile landed around 20 miles short of the Dimona site, in Israel’s Negev desert. Israel has some of the most tightly protected airspace in the world and has shot down drones and missiles at various points over the past decade, including during a similar incident in early 2017 in which one Syrian missile downed an Israeli jet and another landed in the country’s north. Air raid sirens sounded at about 1.30am in Abu Krinat, a village in Israel’s desert. Security sources said the projectile exploded in mid-air – a common technique used by anti-aircraft missiles to guarantee they hit jets – and that fragments landing on the ground. Israel’s military said its forces responded to the missile by bombing the “battery from which the missile was launched and additional Syrian surface-to-air batteries in the area”. With tensions already high with Iran, Israel may be seen as wanting to play down any attempted attack or risk a confrontation. Still, Israel has in the past been quick to blame Syria or Iran for other alleged strikes, including when it accused Iranian forces of firing rockets at its troops in 2018. Israel and Iran have fought an increasingly open war across the region in the past three years, with more than 1,000 airstrikes inside Syria and Iraq, missiles fired, and mines placed by both sides against commercial shipping, and the assassination of Iranian nuclear officials, which western intelligence agencies have blamed on Israel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/apr/25/poland-change-europe-high-achievers-country","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-25T12:36:17Z","webTitle":"Poland has changed beyond recognition – and so has its place in Europe's pecking order | Anna Gromada","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/poland-change-europe-high-achievers-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/poland-change-europe-high-achievers-country","fields":{"headline":"Poland has changed beyond recognition – and so has its place in Europe’s pecking order","bodyText":"When the iron curtain was swept away on that miraculous night of 9 November 1989, it exposed some of the deepest differences between geographical neighbours the world has ever recorded. The 13:1 GDP per capita gap between Poland and soon-to-be united Germany was twice that between the US and Mexico. That same night, my pregnant mother and her brothers were workers in the shadow economy on an eco-farm near Frankfurt, helping to meet the needs of a newly minted class of environmentally aware Germans. My family admired that country where “you never got lost on a highway”. People in Germany drove immaculately clean cars and manual labourers could play Stille Nacht on several instruments – which they did at the farm for Christmas 1989 – leading my mother to marvel at an education system that could so universally equip people not just with marketable skills but also with an ingrained sense of beauty. Neighbouring countries tend to have comparable levels of development. A common security context, investment spillovers, migration, remittances and regional supply chains create geographical pockets of welfare or poverty that transcend borders on the map. It takes a solid physical barrier – the Himalayas between China and Nepal for instance, the barbed wire that runs along the Korean border, or the Berlin Wall – to maintain economic chasms such as those that existed between the Poland and Germany of my mother’s era. But eastern Europe’s economic prospects were rapidly revived by the economic integration that took off in Europe in the 1990s. Reunified Germany wanted to have something akin to “the west” in its immediate eastern neighbourhood even if this required a degree of political heavy-lifting elsewhere in the EU. France was much less keen on adopting post-communist orphans in a united Europe. Like China in the 1990s, eastern Europe embarked on its capitalist journey as a simple subcontractor. Ready parts would be parachuted in like sealed Lego sets to be assembled by a cheap and docile workforce that simply followed the instructions before exporting the completed products with low added value to richer countries. At this stage, the low cost of labour drove foreign investment. From 1992 to 2014, wages in Poland slid from 63% of GDP – the level of today’s unionised Germany – to 46%, second lowest in the EU. Car factories in Germany paid workers €3,122 a month, almost four times as much as their Polish, Czech, Slovak or Hungarian colleagues, who made €835 for similar work. “We built capitalism without capital,” Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, who was Poland’s prime minister in 1991, told me a quarter of a century later – when I questioned what appeared to my generation to be an economic model based willingly on semi-dependency. It replaced a communist-era coerced economic dependency on the east – courtesy of Soviet tanks. In the early 2000s, about to join the ranks of EU citizens, my greatest personal hope was for a world-class education. I was trying to learn more languages, cracking my head against German grammar from the aptly named textbook Deutsch – deine Chance (German – Your Chance). Polish eco-farm workers were just hoping to move out of the shadows and into the legal, tax-paying economy. But the farm in Germany, devoted to environmental ethics, showed less commitment to its human equivalent. The illegal workers were pulling double shifts on little sleep, with inadequate health and safety protection on machines operated 24/7. One of those machines fatally injured my uncle. The employer offered to pay to have the coffin taken back to Poland. We, his family, offered to forget about the case. Back then, we assumed this was an acceptable deal. Maybe it was because we preserved some of the thought patterns that had served us well in the past. We clung to them until our operating system got an update. For eastern Europe, the 2004 accession to the EU came as a long-awaited escape from the trap of history. It opened a cashflow for governments, freedom of movement and a vast labour market for workers, and elite universities for overeager girls like me. Others benefited even more. Between 2010 and 2016, Poland received 2.7% of GDP as EU transfers annually, and sent 4.7% as profits to western investors. The gaps were even larger for smaller countries: 2% to 7.5% for the Czech Republic, and 4% to 7.2% for Hungary. From 2004, Poland’s and Germany’s economic cycles intimately aligned, as if in a compatible but unequal marriage. This paid off during the 2008 financial crash: Poland remained an island of growth in a sea of continental recession – largely because Germany, its main contractor, weathered the storm. Germany is almost as important to Poland as the next six of its trade partners put together. Fully 28% of Poland’s exports go to Germany. Less than 6% of German exports go to Poland. My private misgivings about our treatment didn’t germinate until the next decade, by which time I was a poster child for western integration after an educational grand tour through Oxbridge, the Ivy League and grande école. It was 2014 and I was sitting in my best friend’s dorm in Geneva, surrounded by human rights adepts, when this very upper-middle-class question popped into my head: why hadn’t we sued that eco-farm owner back then for such a preventable accident? This question foreshadowed the emergence of a newly entitled ego which regarded the law as a legitimate tool in its playbook, and ahistorically flagellated its past self for not considering what now appeared obvious. Like my sense of entitlement, my country has changed beyond recognition. Poland has experienced uninterrupted growth over three decades, the longest in European history. Its GDP has increased tenfold nominally, sixfold when corrected for the cost of living. It has a record low unemployment rate of 3%, lower infant mortality than Canada, higher female life expectancy than the US and less violent crime than the UK . And now you don’t get lost on Polish highways either. The change is symbolised by, guess what, the car industry. It turned out that eastern Europe did not after all have to be just the assembly line: it could do without the Lego sets. Poland, and others, started clambering up the value chain. Our factories were soon producing high-quality components on the spot rather than importing them from somewhere in Bavaria or Hessen. Poland began to export not just finished cars, but engines, then electric car batteries. The country’s organic move up the supply chain, gave rise to a question: if we have all the human and technical components for car production, why don’t we do it ourselves? This question was a real-world illustration of what theorists such as Joseph Schumpeter said happens in globalised capitalism when technological progress overtakes and destroys established industrial monopolies (such as those of western Europe) turning them into the dinosaurs and giving newcomers (such as eastern Europe) a chance to sneak in. In 2004, joining the EU meant higher standards of living, unprecedented economic growth and life chances. For years, it also meant accepting an inbuilt bias in rule-making towards the old-timers: France and Germany. The EU-funded highway system in Poland for example, primarily developed the west-east axis, promoting German trade and North Sea ports, rather than the north-south axis which would boost Poland as an eastern European trade hub along with its Baltic ports. When Poland became a leader in European road haulage services, Germany pushed for common EU rules for truck drivers which harmed the competitiveness of Polish transport companies which employ half a million workers and account for 6% of GDP. To many in Poland, the reform looked like a selective application of rules in the service of richer countries. But the balance of power is steadily shifting in ways that some may find uncomfortable. The last few years have been marked by political and economic ruptures in the Poland-Germany relationship. Politically, the feeling that Germany failed to take Ukraine’s sovereignty seriously – until its own supply of Russian gas was threatened – has provoked angst throughout the region. What if, one day, they don’t take our sovereignty seriously either? Economically, the surface current still looks like the old model of Polish subcontracting, relatively cheaper labour and a slow clamber up the value chain. But it masks undertows of a new economic relationship in which Germany faces competition from its eastern back yard. A Polish-Finnish firm recently launched pioneering satellites with cloud-penetrating technology. The US army has just procured 10,000 Polish Manpad missiles (man-portable air-defence systems) after they proved more effective than American Stingers. The Polish army sourced nanosatellites newly invented by a local company. Some Polish start-ups, such as molecular diagnostics firms, are being sold for hundreds of millions of dollars. And the Polish electric car Izera will hit the market in 2026 with plans to produce 60% of components locally. No wonder that, although it does so with velvet gloves, Germany uses its EU muscle to try to impede Polish strategic infrastructural investments such as new nuclear power plants, inland waterways and the development of a container port in Szczecin-Świnoujscie – an obvious competitive threat to German ports. Globally and locally, economic cooperation based on a centre-periphery division of labour is being challenged. When your assembly line grows in power, it starts coming up with its own Lego sets. China-US rivalry may soon be echoed in regional (and friendlier) miniatures, such as a Polish-German divide. As eastern Europe grows in power, it is questioning its role in the pecking order. The region has learned the hard way that if you are not at the negotiating table, you are on the menu.

Firearms police from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) are to be posted on ferries out of Dover, as well as on passenger ships between Newcastle and the Netherlands. The move will tighten security on British ferries, which are unguarded and seen as vulnerable, with passengers not individually searched or given body scans when boarding, unlike those on planes or Eurostar trains. A government spokesperson said: “The government will always take the strongest possible action to protect our national security and our priority remains maintaining the safety and security of our citizens. “We are constantly developing protection for UK citizens against the threat of terrorism. This includes strengthening security by fully equipping law enforcement and emergency responders to respond to terrorist incidents, no matter where they occur.” It is understood about 40 CNC officers will be posted on a rotation basis on ferries with a trial starting in July. The CNC has officers available as a result of nuclear power stations being decommissioned. A senior counter-terrorism source told the Times that ferries were seen as extremely vulnerable and “completely unguarded”. “Ferries are the weak link when it comes to policing transport against terror attacks. Moving a handful of CNC officers to ferries makes sense and they will be a visible deterrent,” the source said. A government source confirmed to the Guardian there was “no specific threat to passenger vessels” and the treaty and other cooperation with France formed part of the UK government’s wider strategy to ensure it was able to protect UK citizens against terrorism “no matter where it occurs”. With the decommissioning of nuclear power stations, the number of officers required to protect them is falling. The decision to redeploy CNC officers is part of a plan to extend the force’s remit to enable them to offer services beyond the civil nuclear sector and provide support to other police forces. A UK-France maritime security treaty was signed in July to improve joint working. It will come into force once the UK and France have completed ratification procedures and is designed to mitigate against a high-threat security incident on a ferry or other large vessel in the Channel. The treaty includes provisions that would enable the UK and France to share security information concerning potential threats, mount swifter and stronger initial responses to serious security incidents, coordinate more efficient joint responses and cooperate more effectively in the aftermath of an attack or incident, a spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jun/15/two-us-volunteers-in-ukraine-feared-taken-prisoner-by-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-16T00:12:21Z","webTitle":"Two US volunteers in Ukraine feared taken prisoner by Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/15/two-us-volunteers-in-ukraine-feared-taken-prisoner-by-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jun/15/two-us-volunteers-in-ukraine-feared-taken-prisoner-by-russia","fields":{"headline":"Two US volunteers in Ukraine feared taken prisoner by Russia","bodyText":"Two American volunteers in Ukraine have gone missing and are feared to have been taken prisoner by Russia, officials and family members said on Wednesday. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, 27, are both US military veterans who had been living in Alabama and went to Ukraine to assist with war efforts. Relatives have been in contact with Senate and House offices seeking information on the men’s whereabouts. The pair haven’t been heard from in days, members of the state’s congressional delegation have said. Captive Americans would add another layer of complexity to efforts by the US, which is pumping billions of dollars into Ukraine but trying to steer clear of direct confrontation with Russia. If confirmed, they would be the first Americans fighting for Ukraine known to have been captured since the war began in February. Drueke’s mother reached out earlier this week, said Terri Sewell, her local congresswoman. “According to his family, they have not heard from Drueke in several days,” Sewell said in a statement. “We will continue to do everything in our power to assist in locating him and finding answers for his family.” White House spokesman John Kirby said he could not confirm the disappearance of the two Americans but said, “If it’s true, we’ll do everything we can to get them safely back home.” He said that the US discouraged Americans from traveling to Ukraine, which has endured a nearly four-month war against invading Russian forces. “It is a war zone. It is combat. And if you feel passionate about supporting Ukraine, there’s any number of other ways to do that that are safer and just as effective,” Kirby told reporters. The Telegraph, which first reported their disappearances, quoted an unnamed fellow fighter who said the two men were captured after running into a larger Russian force during a 9 June battle north-east of Kharkiv. Drueke’s mother, Lois Drueke, said her son told his family that he was teaching Ukrainian troops how to use US-made weapons. “Alex felt very strongly that he had been trained in ways that he could help the Ukrainians be strong and push Putin back,” she told the Washington Post, referring to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Two British nationals have been reported killed in the fighting and another two Britons are facing the death penalty after being captured and convicted as mercenaries by a pro-Russian court. Joe Biden earlier Wednesday announced another $1bn in military aid to Ukraine but has said that US forces will not directly engage Russia, a fellow nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/08/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-197-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T00:33:25Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 197 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/08/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-197-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/08/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-197-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 197 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine has recaptured several settlements in the north-eastern Kharkiv region as part of a surprise counterattack, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed. “This week we have good news from Kharkiv region,” he said in his Wednesday evening address, adding that “now is not the right time to name those settlements where the Ukrainian flag has returned”. An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. US intelligence says Ukrainian forces are making “slow but meaningful progress” on the battlefield. “We’ll see how things pan out,” defence undersecretary Colin Kahl said. “But I certainly think things are going better on the Ukrainian side right now in the south than is true on the Russian side.” The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based thinktank, reported on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces probably captured Verbivka, less than two miles (3.2km) north-west of Balakliia, on Tuesday, citing geo-locatable images posted by Ukrainian soldiers. Shelling resumed near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Wednesday. Ukrainian officials accused Russian forces of firing on the city of Nikopol, across from the plant, as well as in Enerhodar, where the power plant is located. “Employees of communal and other services simply do not have time to complete emergency and restoration work, as another shelling reduces their work to zero,” the Ukrainian mayor of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, said on Telegram. The UN has accused Moscow of forcing Ukrainians into detention camps and even prisons via a Kremlin-directed “filtration” program, and removing children from the war zone to hand over to adoptive parents inside Russia. “We are concerned that the Russian authorities have adopted a simplified procedure to grant Russian citizenship to children without parental care, and that these children would be eligible for adoption by Russian families,” Ilze Brands Kehris, assistant UN secretary-general for human rights, told the security council. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the council that estimates indicate authorities have “interrogated, detained, and forcibly deported” between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainians to Russia since late February in an attempt “to prepare for an attempted annexation”. The body of a British aid worker who was captured by Russian proxies in April has been handed to Ukraine with “possible signs of unspeakable torture”, according to the country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. Paul Urey, 45, from Warrington, Cheshire, was captured along with another Briton, Dylan Healey. The two men were charged with “mercenary activities” by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, but in July the Russian proxy authorities announced that Urey had died as a result of “illness and stress”. Kuleba said Urey’s body had been returned, showing possible signs of torture. Vladimir Putin has threatened to tear up a fragile Ukraine grain deal allowing exports from the Black Sea. During a bellicose speech at an economic conference in Vladivostok, Putin said he would speak with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, about “limiting the destinations for grain exports”, claiming that only two of 87 ships leaving Ukraine with grain had gone to developing countries. Data from the UN showed the claim was false by a factor of at least 10. Putin also threatened to cut off all deliveries of gas, oil, and coal to Europe if they imposed a price cap on Russian energy imports. “Will there be any political decisions that contradict the contracts? Yes, we just won’t fulfil them. We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests,” he said, according to a Reuters translation of his remarks. “We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil – we will not supply anything.” Recalling a Russian fairytale, he said that Europeans could “freeze like the wolf’s tail”. Putin declared that Russia had “lost nothing” in launching a war on Ukraine during a belligerent and defiant speech at the Russian Eastern Economic Forum on Wednesday. “We haven’t lost anything and we won’t lose anything,” he said, when asked about the cost of the invasion. “The main gain is the strengthening of our sovereignty.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/mar/27/boris-johnson-to-confront-bitter-tory-splits-over-uk-energy-strategy-and-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-27T08:15:20Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson to confront bitter Tory splits over UK energy strategy and bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/27/boris-johnson-to-confront-bitter-tory-splits-over-uk-energy-strategy-and-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/mar/27/boris-johnson-to-confront-bitter-tory-splits-over-uk-energy-strategy-and-bills","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson to confront bitter Tory splits over UK energy strategy and bills","bodyText":"Boris Johnson is expected to hold crunch talks with senior cabinet ministers this week to resolve fractious talks over plans to tackle rising bills and boost the country’s energy security. The government’s energy strategy has been delayed by cabinet splits over onshore wind, funding for nuclear energy and the role fracking should play given spiralling energy prices and the Ukraine invasion. It is understood that major disagreements still remain between the prime minister, chancellor Rishi Sunak and Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary. The cabinet tensions have only grown since the chancellor’s spring statement last week, which drew criticism for failing to do enough on the cost of living. Sunak now faces pressure from Number 10 to sanction spending on new nuclear power and renewables projects. Kwarteng’s department is said to be keen on schemes that would boost onshore wind by giving energy bill discounts for those who live near turbines – a scheme that has been run successfully by Octopus Energy. The prime minister is also said to favour accelerating the creation of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) produced by Rolls-Royce, but Sunak has been warning about the long-term costs involved in a big expansion of nuclear power. Voters now regard energy as the second most important issue facing the UK, even ahead of the economy. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer found that 48% of voters flagged it as an important issue, up 17 points from a month ago. Only health and the NHS are greater concerns. The disputes are rumbling on alongside concerns that some of the help already offered by the chancellor on household bills will not reach vulnerable households. The Observer has been told that more than a million households are set to miss out on one of the main measures. An official assessment of its much-vaunted £150 council tax rebate predicted that 1.3m households won’t receive it. In its assessment of the spring statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted that a fifth of those who did not pay their council tax by direct debit would not take up the rebate, thereby saving the exchequer £195m. Local councils warned they had not been given the resources to deliver the rebate. The most vulnerable households are more likely to be among those who do not receive the tax cut automatically. The government has said it is the job of local councils to ensure that those who do not receive the rebate automatically do not miss out. However, the Observer has seen pleas from councils to ministers that they have not been given the resources to help them ensure no one misses out. One council leader said distributing the rebate would cost it “in the region of £450,000, with no government funding to assist”. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said: “It is staggering that more than a million families are set to miss out because of this Conservative government’s half-baked plans. Often those who don’t pay council tax by direct debit are older and more deprived, meaning some of these households are likely to be among the most vulnerable in the country. “People are facing sky-rocketing bills and plummeting living standards, but it looks like even the meagre support on offer from the Conservatives won’t reach those who need it most. Rishi Sunak must confirm that anyone who misses out on the rebate will get their £150 cheque in the post. No one should go without the help they need because of this Conservative government’s incompetence.” A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “Direct debit is the quickest and easiest way to pay council tax, and the best way for most people to get the rebate. Councils are responsible for making sure eligible households who don’t pay their council tax by direct debit receive the rebate and we have suggested a range of payment options. With the support of councils, we are confident that all those eligible for a rebate will receive their payments in good time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
