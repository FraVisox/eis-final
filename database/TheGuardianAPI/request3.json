Alexander Rodnyansky, an adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the war-torn country needed to speed up efforts to reform industries as it looked to rebuild after Russia’s invasion. Rodnyansky told the Guardian that the Ukrainian government needed to “create the foundations for rapid economic growth” while also financing the conflict. Ukraine faces a debt crisis as well as inflation of more than 20% as the country counts the cost of Russia’s offensive. Rodnyansky, who is also a professor of economics at the University of Cambridge, said “receiving more foreign aid is the easiest way to fund the war”; however, efforts were being made to cut spending, collect taxes and issue debt to finance its efforts. He said that Zelenskiy and his top team were also examining priorities to rebuild the economy, including progressing efforts initiated before the war to rework 50-year-old labour regulations. “We have deep issues with our labour code, developed in the 1970s, that needs to be overhauled. “We’re going to try to emulate a more liberal approach, like Denmark, with a flexible labour market because we need to catch up.” Rodnyansky said there were “peculiarities with our post-Soviet system” that had fuelled red tape. “If you want to let someone off on holiday, there is four pages of bureaucracy you need to go through. “There are also more conventional things to reform: ease of hiring, ease of firing, severance pay, flexible hours and contracts and fixed-term contracts.” Labour organisations have expressed concerns over workers’ rights amid the Ukrainian government’s labour liberalisation, which has included a vote in favour of legalising zero-hours contracts earlier this year. Rodnyansky said he was also in favour of reviewing minimum wages to scrap them in some industries where it did not increase employment. “We need to make sure it’s not too high because our economy is collapsing and we need to make sure it does not push up unemployment,” he said. A group of leading economists said last month that Ukraine’s government needed to overhaul its tax and spending policies or risk an economic crisis that could “cripple its ability to sustain the war effort”. Rodnyansky called on western nations to expand the sanctions imposed on Russian companies and individuals and sell their assets to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine. “The UK has done a lot but it has not been exhaustive,” he said. The government of Ukraine, the European Commission and the World Bank have estimated that the cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine is almost $350bn (£310bn) and rising. Rodnyansky was promoted to become chief economic adviser earlier this year after two years with the government. His father is a film producer who helped Zelenskiy become a household name as an actor. Russian attacks on Ukrainian power stations, including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear site in south-eastern Ukraine, have led to safety worries about nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/04/dockers-on-merseyside-refuse-to-unload-russian-oil-stanlow-kent-netherlands-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-05T12:40:37Z","webTitle":"Dockers at Merseyside refinery refuse to unload Russian oil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/dockers-on-merseyside-refuse-to-unload-russian-oil-stanlow-kent-netherlands-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/04/dockers-on-merseyside-refuse-to-unload-russian-oil-stanlow-kent-netherlands-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Dockers at UK refinery refuse to unload Russian oil","bodyText":"Dockworkers at the Ellesmere Port refinery in Cheshire have refused to unload Russian oil, echoing steps taken by counterparts at a gas terminal in Kent and in the Netherlands, as dissent spread across European ports in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Unite said it had informed the owner of the Stanlow refinery, India’s Essar Group, that its members would “under no circumstances unload any Russian oil regardless of the nationality of the vessel which delivers it”. A ban on Russian vessels introduced by transport secretary, Grant Shapps, this week does not cover cargo. This has allowed several ships to dock despite carrying gas or oil that was ultimately purchased from Kremlin-controlled entities. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said: “Essar may believe that it is justifiable to transport Russian oil under a flag of convenience but Unite does not. Unite urges the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, to close this loophole immediately.” The Stanlow refinery, near Liverpool, is a key source of oil in the north-west of England, and is supported by a key trading relationship with Litasco, a fuel trading firm owned by Russia’s second largest oil company, Lukoil. The action at Stanlow came as gas prices hit record highs and dockworkers in Rotterdam said they would also refuse to unload oil and gas tainted by “blood”, hiring lawyers to back their campaign. Russia typically supplies 30-40% of Europe’s gas, mostly via pipelines, but liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments are another significant source. Ten oil tankers are en route to Rotterdam from Russia, with about 40 more Russian ships due to dock at Europe’s biggest port in the coming month, shipping data shows. Dutch dockers said on Friday they would not offload the cargoes and were preparing for a legal backlash from oil companies and shippers. “There is blood on this oil, blood on this coal and blood on the gas,” said Niek Stam, a spokesperson for FNV Havens, the largest Dutch dockworkers’ union. “We are in the process of finding out how we can boycott it without risking an enormous fine in court,” he told the investigative journalism unit Source Material. The Dutch government has taken no action against Russian ships. Stam said he feared being sued by Russian businesspeople or Dutch oil companies who would “bankrupt his union”, if he encouraged dockers to reject Russian cargoes before his government takes action. FNV Havens has consulted lawyers in readiness for that eventuality. The Netherlands receives more ships from Russia each year than any other European country, most of them docking in Rotterdam. If European countries did not act together to block Russian vessels the ships would simply divert to neighbouring countries, Stam said. In the UK, some consignments of Russian oil and gas have still been able to arrive, notably at Foyle Port in Northern Ireland and Tranmere on Merseyside. Dockers at the Isle of Grain terminal in the Thames Estuary refused to handle a consignment of liquefied natural gas bound for Centrica, the owner of British Gas, forcing the tanker carrying LNG to divert. One gas analyst said that dockworkers who do not want to handle Russian gas and oil may find it hard to identify cargoes because it can be switched between ships. He pointed to one Russian-managed tanker that arrived in France and would have been barred from the UK under Shapps’ ban. Instead, it pumped its cargo on to another boat that then sailed to Isle of Grain. On Friday, another vessel called the Pluto was still moored at Foyle Port, where one source said port staff were “sickened” after they were informed by the Department for Transport that there was no legal basis for refusing entry. The Seacod, a German-owned tanker carrying Russian oil, was moored in the Mersey on Friday, clearly visible from riverside walkways near the centre of Liverpool. An Essar spokesperson said the company was “deeply concerned by the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Ukraine” and that it was “fully complying with the statutory framework implemented by the UK government with regard to Russia-related entities”. They added: “Earlier this week, we turned away two cargos of non-Russian origin crude oil which would have been delivered in Russian-flagged tankers. “We can confirm that a German-flagged vessel was approved to berth at Tranmere oil terminal by the port authority on Thursday 3 March. This vessel set sail for Tranmere on 22 February, before the invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent introduction of UK government sanctions. “For a number of days, we have been working urgently to find alternative sources of diesel while simultaneously ensuring uninterrupted supply of fuel to the north-west of England. “Essar will continue to comply fully and will respond promptly to any changes the UK government may make to the statutory framework of sanctions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/05/how-are-western-firms-with-russian-interests-reacting-to-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-05T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"How are western firms with Russian interests reacting to sanctions?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/how-are-western-firms-with-russian-interests-reacting-to-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/05/how-are-western-firms-with-russian-interests-reacting-to-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"How are western firms with Russian interests reacting to sanctions?","bodyText":"The Russian Wealth Advisors Forum describes itself as “the leading meeting place” for global experts who advise ultra-high net worth individuals from Russia and the post-Soviet states. The agenda for this year’s gathering in Zürich, due to be held in May, was laser-focused on defending the wealth of the Russian super-rich. “The world has become a perilous place for the wealthy,” the event’s website fretted. “Governments are hungry for cash. Information on who owns what is flowing around. The rich are in the spotlight, and often a target.” Presentations, including “The Pandora papers and their effect on the wealthy”, “Tax and immigration”, and whether cryptocurrency was a bankable asset, would be delivered by speakers from top accounting and legal firms, including PwC, EY and Mishcon de Reya. But as of Thursday morning, the Russian Wealth Advisors Forum was no more. “We are currently in the process of exit from the Russian market, passing all Russian events to a new owner,” the event’s organiser said by email. Exactly who will be willing to take on such an event now is unclear. Rather than strategising fresh deals and investments, Russia’s billionaires and millionaires are instead frantically relocating their liquid assets out of democratic states, fleeing a tsunami of sanctions from the US, the EU, and to a lesser extent the UK, aimed at pressuring the Putin regime into a ceasefire. On Wednesday the Biden administration announced the formation of Task Force KleptoCapture to identify and freeze the assets of Russian business people who prospered under the Putin regime. “Oligarchs be warned: we will use every tool to freeze and seize your criminal proceeds,” said Lisa Monaco, the deputy attorney general. At the same time, western businesses are scrambling to reduce their exposure to the Russian market with the hope of mitigating the blowback from current or further sanctions. In the UK, that has created a host of problems for the consultants, accountants, PR firms and lawyers who represent London’s professional services sector. The lawyers London’s defamation lawyers have developed a chequered reputation at home and internationally for threatening journalists with UK court action on behalf of wealthy clients. That distaste has traditionally been countered with the argument that every client is entitled to representation. But after the invasion, at least one libel firm has said it was not accepting Putinist clients. In a statement published on its website, Carter-Ruck said it was “not working for any Russian individuals, companies or entities seeking to challenge, overturn, frustrate or minimise sanctions”, and that it never had. “Carter-Ruck is not acting for, and will not be acting for, any individual, company or entity associated with the Putin regime,” it said. “We are not acting for any sanctioned individuals or entities, whether to have sanctions lifted or otherwise,” said a spokesperson for Schillings. “We hope that the government’s sanctions will be an effective tool in foreshortening the Russian regime’s abhorrent war in Ukraine.” Another libel firm, Harbottle and Lewis, said: “We are not acting for any sanctioned individuals or entities, and we are not engaging and nor have we engaged with the government in relation to the imposition of any sanctions.” One of the partners at a third firm, Mishcon de Reya, was among those who had been scheduled to speak at the Russian Advisors Wealth Forum before it was pulled. A spokesperson for the firm said he would have withdrawn had the event not been cancelled first. The spin doctors The public relations industry also faces a reckoning, with UK government sources briefing that those who continue to represent allies and agents of the Putin regime could expect to pay a price. In addition to dumping sanctioned clients, “we are also in the process of reviewing all ongoing connections with non-sanctioned Russian entities and, where it is appropriate to withdraw from those matters, we will do so,” said a spokesperson for FTI Consulting. “We will not be taking on any new Russia-controlled clients at this time.” Asked if it was still representing Oleg Deripaska’s aluminium firm EN+, Billy Clegg, a partner at the PR firm Camarco replied: “We resigned yesterday.” Andrew Hayes, the managing partner of the PR firm Hudson Sandler, said: “In light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which we utterly condemn, we are stopping all our Russia business.” Francis Ingham, head of the Public Relations and Communications Association, told Politico that Russia was now “a pariah state”. He continued: “Our members cannot, under any circumstances, support organisations that are on the sanctions list.” The accountants Accountancy firms, including the so-called “big four” – PwC, EY, Deloitte and KPMG – have issued statements expressing shock at the Russian invasion. Together they employ more than 13,000 people in the country, and audit the accounts and balance sheets of private and state-owned entities. Firms do not routinely publish their profits at a country level, although an EY transparency document from 2019 reported revenues of more than 6bn roubles (£41m). A PwC spokesperson said it deplored “the violation of international law and the Russian aggression against Ukraine”, while EY said it was “evaluating existing and new mandates in light of new sanctions and a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape”. A spokesperson for Deloitte said: “Russia’s invasion of this sovereign nation is an indefensible act of aggression that echoes the darkest days in European history.” “It has been devastating to watch the tragic events in Ukraine unfold and my thoughts are with all of those affected,” said Jonathan Holt, the chief executive of KPMG UK in a statement condemning the invasion on LinkedIn. Amid the expressions of dismay, substantive commitments to shutter Russian offices or cease working with state-owned Russian entities have been noticeably lacking. However speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior executive at one of the big four said the firms were necessarily issuing “tortured” statements in order to avoid inciting reprisals against local employees by the Putin regime. The executive explained that accounting firms were federations of companies associated with a brand, rather than hierarchical structures whereby a Russian subsidiary was “owned” by a western headquarters. As a result accountancy firms global headquarters’ cannot easily instruct their Russian offices to drop certain business, and many, if not most, of their local partners are themselves Russian. As well as opening the firms up to legal claims for breach of contract, they said, this would risk inciting retaliation against local staff by the Kremlin, which has signalled plans to ban western firms from dumping their clients. But they said it was likely that within a matter of months the various firms’ Russian arms would disaffiliate from the western brands. “Directionally are people going to have to leave their networks? Probably yes,” they said. “But it has to be done in such a way as to not antagonise the Russian authorities.” The same executive said the massive array of sanctions levelled against Putinist Russiaafter its invasion of Ukraine had created a legal minefield for western, and particularly American, firms retaining their Russian businesses or subsidiaries. Multinationals from McDonald’s to Microsoft field Russian subsidiaries, which still need to be reflected on their parent company’s balance sheet, the executive said. There is a legal requirement for all subsidiaries to be audited in order to guarantee the financial integrity of their parent companies. However, the executive said, it is now unclear whether such accounts can legally be audited by a western firm. Similarly, if Russia proceeds with laws banning western companies from leaving, accountancy firms could be committing criminal or civil offences in Russia if they simply abandon the business. That leaves accountancy firms stuck between a rock and a hard place, needing to balance their compliance with western sanctions against the risk of reprisal from the Kremlin. Nonetheless, they said, the direction of travel was clear and it was inevitable that significant drawdown would take place over the coming months. “There is an enormous amount of work going on behind the scenes,” the executive said. “The current status quo is not an option.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/jan/04/the-age-of-interconnection-by-jonathan-sperber-review-a-breathless-race-through-recent-history","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-04T09:00:13Z","webTitle":"The Age of Interconnection by Jonathan Sperber review – a breathless race through recent history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/04/the-age-of-interconnection-by-jonathan-sperber-review-a-breathless-race-through-recent-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/jan/04/the-age-of-interconnection-by-jonathan-sperber-review-a-breathless-race-through-recent-history","fields":{"headline":"The Age of Interconnection by Jonathan Sperber review – a breathless race through recent history","bodyText":"It takes chutzpah to write a synoptic history of the world in the second half of the 20th century, a period within living memory of the reading public. But it is a history Jonathan Sperber handles with brio, summoning evidence from personal anecdotes and high theory, vignettes and statistics. In its range of themes and reconstructions, The Age of Interconnection invites favourable comparison with that other survey of the 20th century, Eric Hobsbawm’s The Age of Extremes. Yet it is quite unlike it. Where the Marxist historian offered a sweeping narrative arc illustrating the relentless advance of capitalism, Sperber dispenses with a unifying theme altogether. It’s a sign of the times: we’ve lost faith in grand narratives, more’s the pity. His framing sheds little light on his period. As every historian knows, all ages are ages of interconnection. But what he loses in explanatory depth, he gains in intellectual breadth. Reading the book is a bit like watching a pentathlon. In lieu of fencing, riding, swimming, shooting and running, we have sections on the environment, economy, politics, society and cultural and intellectual life. It appears Sperber has taken Proust’s dictum to heart: “to write on everything to the point of exhaustion”. The exhaustiveness verges on redundancy at times, as in his tortuous excursions on staphylococcus and streptococcus infections, and rocket velocity. Class in the 20th century “took the form of a hierarchy”, he explains, as if to a Martian. But even if he doesn’t spell it out, there is a story being told. He divides his Age into three sub-periods: the Postwar Era (roughly, the baby boomer generation), the Age of Upheaval (the children of Marx and Coca-Cola), and the Late Millennium Era (the heirs of the end of history). A simpler schema would have been just as serviceable: the first half was the age of ambition; the second, one of apathy. Nothing screamed mid-century ambition like five-year plans. There’s something touching about the confidence of the Soviets’ state planning committee, whose annual inventories of necessary commodities ran to 70 volumes and 12,000 pages. Not so China’s Second Five-Year Plan, the famous Great Leap Forward, which redirected farm labour to backyard furnaces to augment steel output, destroying crop yields and also some 30 million lives in the process. But it was colossal state power, Sperber reminds us, that made modern public heath possible. Mass production of penicillin helped secure allied victory in the second world war. It took scarcely a decade to eradicate smallpox by 1977. The insecticide DDT came close to dispatching the gypsy moth and fire ant in the US two decades earlier. Asahi Gurafu, Japan’s answer to Life magazine, informed readers in the 50s that nuclear power would prevent sashimi from spoiling. The director of the Kurchatov Institute, the nerve centre of the Soviet atomic programme, thought it could be harnessed to transform Siberia into a subtropical paradise. Nature had its revenge, of course. The decimation of insects’ avian predators called into question the wisdom of spraying the midwest with DDT. Drug-resistant superbugs emerged. TB and malaria returned. Aids appeared on the scene. The blase response did little to help. “Aids is primarily a disease of homosexuals and there is no homosexual in Botswana,” an official declared. One of the statements must have been wrong, because by 2000, one in four adults there was HIV positive. Five years after the release of David Bowie’s Life on Mars?, a 1976 Viking expedition to the planet answered his question. Nuclear missiles remained in their silos, but cigarettes accounted for the death of one in five men in the second half of the century. The oil shock revealed the dark sides of both communism and capitalism. Struggling to pay off dollar-denominated debts, the GDR had a Stasi agent sell art and literary manuscripts to western collectors for hard currency. Romania went further, “selling” Jews to western governments for $25,000 per person. Labour, king in the middle of the century – saving Juan Perón, then Argentina’s vice president, from a military coup in 1945; overthrowing Edward Heath in 1974 – lost to capital, which regained the upper hand after a string of strikes were put down in the early 80s, from Girangaon to Orgreave. Sperber offers a sobering balance sheet of “heavily regulated capitalism”, which delivered phenomenal growth but also produced trade imbalances and global hierarchies. He doesn’t say as much, but I get the impression that he thinks this is the worst way of organising societies except for all the others. It’s a worldview that puts him in the company of sociologist Raisa Gorbacheva, who road-tripped around Rome in 1971 fleetingly with her husband, to whom she said, I imagine over pasta alla carbonara and frascati: “Misha, why do we live worse than they do?” • Pratinav Anil is a lecturer in history at St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford and author of Another India (Hurst).

Ministers openly admit they do not know what is going on with much of the legislation, but those who remain in government are working with skeleton teams to get bills in shape to be passed. Two ministers at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) have quit so far, Rebecca Pow and Jo Churchill, both of whom were working on environment legislation making its way through parliament. Churchill resigned on Wednesday but on Thursday she was supposed to be in committees about a gene editing bill that would liberalise rules around genetic modification for crops and potentially livestock. The Guardian has been told this has now been passed to the minister Victoria Prentis, who has not resigned. Prentis says she believes it is her duty to stay in government and get bills passed, rather than quit. Sources close to her say those remaining in Defra are “working flat out” because “the environment cannot wait until October”, which is when Boris Johnson’s allies have suggested he should remain prime minister until. Bills experts are particularly worried about include the environmental land management scheme, which has faced criticism from the Tory right as well as from Labour and the Liberal Democrats. This legislation would reward farmers for conserving nature, and Defra sources say net zero will not be reached without this new subsidy system. Other, newer bills under threat include the highly protected marine areas consultation, which would ban all fishing in some fragile ecosystems in England’s seas. This work was under Pow’s purview and is only in the consultation phase. It is unpopular with many in the fishing industry and could be junked. Other departments are also in turmoil. After Michael Gove was sacked as levelling up secretary he was replaced by Greg Clark. Clark is now being given the task of deciding on the proposed Whitehaven coalmine in Cumbria but has not worked in the department for years. On Thursday the government also announced it was postponing for a second time a decision on whether to approve the £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk. The levelling up bill is also coming soon and campaigners say the legislation contains a number of threats to the ability of communities to demand higher environmental protection and standards in the planning system, replaces key environmental rules and fails to align plans with climate legislation. The treasury, with its new chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, is to decide whether to go ahead with a windfall tax on oil and gas companies. A decision on this is due next week, and while it is a popular measure with voters it is unknown whether Zahawi will press ahead with it, and whether he will remove the loophole that would provide tax relief for new oil and gas. There could also be a wait of some time for a government response to the fracking review. The British Geological Survey has given its report on the safety and feasibility of fracking to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), but the results will not be seen until the government responds to it, with BEIS sources saying they do not know when that will be. BEIS will also have to deal with the cost of living and energy crises, with insulation measures and direct support for the poorest households the most urgent priority. The energy security bill is also coming, with an opportunity to overhaul the energy market so the low cost of renewable electricity feeds through to consumers. The Cop president, Alok Sharma, has not quit but is drawing on the talents of a much-diminished cabinet and a government in chaos. The UK still holds the presidency until Cop27 in November and the government has yet to decide on the formal emission-cutting pledges to be made. What is more, a judgment on a judicial review of the net zero strategy is expected this month. Depending on what it finds, it may add even more work to the in trays of the remaining environment team. Greenpeace UK’s policy director, Doug Parr, said: “No matter how dire things may seem in Westminster right now, when it comes to the climate crisis things risk getting much worse without immediate action. However, delays to decisions on whether or not to backtrack on coal and build a new mine, or waste untold time and money on a new nuclear power station that will only distract from genuine energy solutions, could be taken as positive, if they were set to be given the green light as rumours suggest. “This parliamentary reset must deliver a new prime minister that will take bolder action on climate and nature. They must invest in real solutions like cheap, clean, homegrown renewables and fixing the vast number of cold, damp, energy-wasting homes. If not, we may lose even more time and find ourselves in a far worse position than we already are.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/putin-wants-to-kill-us-totally-ukrainians-hold-firm-under-bombardment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T15:52:16Z","webTitle":"‘Putin wants to kill us totally’: Ukrainians hold firm under bombardment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/putin-wants-to-kill-us-totally-ukrainians-hold-firm-under-bombardment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/putin-wants-to-kill-us-totally-ukrainians-hold-firm-under-bombardment","fields":{"headline":"‘Putin wants to kill us totally’: Ukrainians hold firm under bombardment","bodyText":"Ten days ago Kharkiv was a flourishing metropolis and home to 1.5 million people. It was, as one resident, Galina Padalko, put it, “a beautiful place”. There were parks, a new German architect-designed zoo, thriving cafes and restaurants, and a monumental central square, once adorned with a statue of Lenin. The city had several universities, international students, a ballet theatre and a cathedral that had withstood the last century’s darkest moments. In a few savage days Kharkiv has been transformed into a living hell. Many of the city’s inhabitants are currently sheltering underground in basements, metro stations, and ground-floor corridors. Russian forces have relentlessly bombarded the city this week, pulverising apartment blocks and other civilian targets and threatening to turn Kharkiv into a new Aleppo, which also faced Russian bombing, or Guernica. It has borne the brunt of Vladimir Putin’s rage. “There is bombing the whole day, from morning to evening, ever since the invasion last week,” Padalko, a communications manager, told the Guardian. “Our flat is shaking and vibrating. We have the feeling Putin wants to kill us totally, absolutely completely. It’s awful. He’s really crazy. Nobody can understand why he does this.” She added: “Kharkiv was the best place to live in Ukraine. Now we are terrified to look out of our windows.” At 8am on Tuesday Russia bombed the main administration building in Kharkiv in Freedom Square. Several cars were going past. The building was destroyed. At least 10 people were killed. It has targeted schools, residential neighbourhoods, the zoo with its lions and elephants, government offices, the theatre, and the city’s Assumption Cathedral – part of the Moscow patriarchy – where locals had taken refuge. Dozens have died. The ferocious attack is being carried out with deadly weapons: BM-30 Smerch heavy multiple rocket launchers and, increasingly, bomber planes. On Sunday Russian light armoured vehicles made an unsuccessful attempt to enter and to grab the city. Now Putin appears to have decided to flatten it instead. The message seems demonstrative. It is directed at the defiant government of Ukraine’s pro-western president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy: you and Kyiv are next. It is hard to disagree with Zelenskiy’s grim assessment made in a speech earlier this week that Russia was seeking to “erase” Ukraine and remove it from Europe’s map. “Russia is fighting with a deliberate violation of all conventions, laws and rules of war, trying to cause maximum damage, to civilian and critical infrastructure and to ordinary people,” the presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. Moscow’s goal was panic and to cause a refugee crisis, he added. “There are many destroyed houses. We are underground, hiding in our local metro station,” said Maya Mironova from Kharkiv, speaking on her mobile. “There are about a thousand people here. Women, children and also pets, cats and dogs.” Mironova said volunteers had organised food points; some of her friends were in basements elsewhere in her Kharkiv tractor factory district; during breaks in the shelling she was able to dash back to her home. “Putin didn’t realise his ambition to take Kharkiv. It’s the former capital of Soviet Ukraine. It’s symbolic for him. He counted on people’s loyalty to Russia and didn’t get it. And so he’s furious. He wants to bomb us so we surrender,” she said. How long could Kharkiv hold out against unbridled Russian firepower? “We won’t surrender. The Ukrainian army is defending. They are here. But I’m afraid Putin will destroy us,” she said. Across Ukraine similar bleak scenes were being played out. Russian tanks have encircled Mariupol, the once-prosperous port city on the Sea of Azov. Shelling has killed dozens, destroyed the heating and water supply, and left tens of thousands of people shivering in basements, cold and terrified. “They do not plan to occupy the city. They plan to ruin it with grads that do not stop,” a resident, Diana Berg, wrote on her Facebook page. She added: “It’s the third day all city is left with no electricity, heat, water and any type of connection. Even radio is being blocked. Shelling is non-stop. The only news you can get is the direction of the bomb. People go out into their backyards to make a fire in order to get a little warmth. The humanitarian blockade is terrifying. It’s unbearable. We are in the dark with no understanding of what is going on with our relatives.” Berg on Friday said she had managed to leave the city – a “miraculous” journey during which she and her husband, Sasha, drove towards and then past a phalanx of 20 Russian tanks and armoured vehicles. “One turned its canon towards us. But for some fucking reason it didn’t fucking shoot us,” she messaged friends incredulously. She apologised for her bad language, saying: “I’ve been swearing for a week now.” Other urban areas hit by Putin’s missiles resemble a dark phantasmagoria as imagined by Hieronymus Bosch. A missile strike on Thursday hit an apartment block in Chernihiv, north of Kyiv, killing 47 people and injuring 18. Video shows bright orange flames, black smoke, broken cars, twisted bodies lying on the street amid rubble, and the piercing, inconsolable scream of a woman. It is a medieval hell, made real by 21st-century Moscow. For now, the capital, Kyiv, is holding firm amid what one former Ukrainian minister described as a “multidirectional raid” by Russia’s army, air force and navy. In the run-up to the invasion little was done to build the city’s defences. Now anti-tank hedgehog traps have been placed along Khreshchatyk, Kyiv’s main boulevard, with its Nike outlets and branch of McDonald’s. The city centre is preternaturally quiet, empty, residents say. There are explosions and birdsong Refugees continue to leave for the west of the country and the relative safety of Lviv, close to the Polish border. Olya Zolotorova, 42, said she had fled her home in the southern city of Mykolaiv, together with her husband and six-year-old son, Leo. Russian troops had blockaded the city but had so far failed to storm it, she said. Its natural geography – Mykolaiv is surrounded by a river on three sides – made it easier to defend from marauding tanks, she said. Zolotorova said she was appalled by the destruction of Kharkiv and other historic cities. “It’s revenge. Putin thought he could capture Ukraine in three days. Now he’s punishing civilians because of his failure.” Nobody could get in or out of Mykolaiv now, she said, adding Russian marines were seeking to storm nearby Odesa, the country’s third-biggest city, and were landing from the Black Sea. “This is one of the most barbaric wars in human history. Just a fucking Mordor,” Illia Ponomarenko, the defence correspondent for the Kyiv Independent, tweeted. Others who escaped Kyiv agreed. “Someone needs to kill Putin. When he is dead this war will stop,” Nikita Perfiliev, a digital marketer, said, sipping a cup of coffee outside a Lviv cafe. A home-drawn poster in its window said: “Fuck off Russian warship” – a message broadcast by Ukrainian sailors and now a meme. “Kharkiv was special. It’s even hard to talk about it,” said Artem Mazhulin, a 31-year-old English teacher. “We had a ferris wheel, a rollercoaster and a cable car in Gorky Park. I went round the new zoo when it opened and saw ostriches and zebras.” Mazhulin said he left Kharkiv on Tuesday, getting on a train packed with students from Nigeria, India and Morocco, with about 100 people in one carriage. The journey to Kyiv was scary, he said, until the train finally crossed to the right bank of the capital and kept going. “We then stopped at towns and villages. People came to the train windows and gave us home-preserved vegetables and water,” he said. What would happen next? Could Ukraine win the war? Would it survive? “We can’t just give up,” he said. “Our spirit is very high.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-208-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-19T17:03:54Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 208 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-208-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-208-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 208 of the invasion","bodyText":"Thirteen people were killed by artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the city’s Russian-backed mayor said. Russian forces struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday, but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, said. The Kremlin has said that beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said on Monday during a visit to China. Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfit’s indecisive stance on economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will visit Saudi Arabia and meet the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesperson said on Monday, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies. The German central bank said on Monday it was increasingly likely that Europe’s largest economy would shrink for a “prolonged” period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province as a “lie”. Russia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of the Ukraine men’s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putin’s invading forces, the Guardian has revealed. The US president, Joe Biden, has warned Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other nonconventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a “consequential” response from the US. Russia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to about 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the British military said on Monday. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added it to the small group of countries excluded from Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral in London today, which includes Belarus, Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The Institute for the Study of War thinktank said Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, was “increasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units” in its latest update on the Russian campaign. The Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson region in the south, where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no letup in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia. In an intelligence update, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, including a power grid and a dam, had intensified. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion.

The engineering company is part of a consortium that is pushing for the government to commit billions of pounds to build 16 of the small modular reactors (SMRs) around the UK. The factory-built nuclear power stations are predicted to provide up to 440MW of electricity each, enough to power a city of 450,000 homes over a planned lifespan of 60 years. The UK SMR Consortium, which also includes the building company Laing O’Rourke and the National Nuclear Laboratory, among others, said the reactors can play a major part in the UK’s efforts to fight the climate crisis with zero direct emissions, as well as boosting UK exports. However, it faces opposition on the grounds of safety, security and cost. The consortium this week signed agreements with the US company Exelon Generation and the Czech power company CEZ to consider the reactors. Small nuclear reactors were first developed in the 1950s to use in nuclear-powered submarines. Since then Rolls-Royce has designed reactors for seven classes of submarine and two separate land-based prototype reactors. However, to be cost-effective for civilian use the power generated by the reactors has to compete with renewable sources such as wind and solar power. The costs of installing renewables have fallen dramatically in the last decade and they do not pose the same safety concerns. The Financial Times last month reported that the government was backing the plans to commit between £1.5bn and £2bn, and that it would form part of Boris Johnson’s 10-point plan for the environment. However, the second wave of coronavirus has caused the delay of the Treasury’s multiyear spending review. Proponents argue the plants could be built in factories and then rapidly and cheaply assembled where needed around the UK. An independent review in 2018 said the government should back the plans but a 2017 study by the consortium partner Atkins found that the electricity produced from the small reactors would be a third more expensive than traditional plants. Tom Samson, the interim chief executive of the UK SMR Consortium, said: “We have developed a manufacturing and assembly process that will make reliable, low-carbon nuclear power affordable, deliverable and investable. “By creating a factory-built power station that rolls off the assembly line we have radically reduced many construction risks associated with new nuclear power stations; and by using proven nuclear technology alongside standardised and simplified components, we make it much more cheaply.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/03/zelenskiy-and-ukraines-allies-label-putins-u-turn-on-grain-deal-a-humiliating-defeat","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-03T07:46:48Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy labels Putin U-turn on Ukraine grain deal a ‘failure of Russian aggression’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/03/zelenskiy-and-ukraines-allies-label-putins-u-turn-on-grain-deal-a-humiliating-defeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/03/zelenskiy-and-ukraines-allies-label-putins-u-turn-on-grain-deal-a-humiliating-defeat","fields":{"headline":"Zelenskiy labels Putin U-turn on Ukraine grain deal a ‘failure of Russian aggression’","bodyText":"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has hailed Russia’s U-turn to rejoin the UN-backed grain export deal as a “significant diplomatic outcome” that demonstrated “the failure of the Russian aggression”. “Implementation of the grain export initiative will continue,” Zelenskiy said in his Wednesday evening address. Russia initially said it would abandon the brokered deal that allowed grain exports from Ukraine through the Black Sea, following a drone attack on its warships in the port of Sevastopol. Russia’s defence ministry said it was satisfied it had received “sufficient” guarantees from Kyiv that it would not use the maritime corridor to carry out attacks. Zelenskiy said the reversal showed “Russian blackmail has led nowhere”. After eight months of war “the Kremlin is saying that they demanded security guarantees from Ukraine”, he said. “Two hundred and fifty two days ago Russia demanded security guarantees from the United States of America. “These are really striking changes. This shows both the failure of Russian aggression and how strong you and I are when we remain united.” Russia’s threatened withdrawal had reignited fears over global hunger and high food prices that had been alleviated by the grain scheme earlier this year, which allowed cargo ships to move Ukrainian gain without fear of being targeted. Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of using the grain corridor to prepare attacks on Russia, including the bombing of the Kerch Bridge in Crimea last month, where the explosives used in the attack were allegedly shipped from Odesa. The US welcomed the restoration of the deal and urged Russia to renew it later this month. The deal is set to expire on 19 November. Russia’s decision to rejoin the UN grain corridor has been seen by Ukraine and its western allies as a humiliating U-turn. “Putin was once again humiliated … the Kremlin blackmailer once again made himself a laughing stock before the whole world and retreated,” Anton Gerashchenko, a senior presidential adviser to Zelenskiy, wrote over Telegram on Wednesday night. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will be seen as having successfully called the Russian bluff to blockade Ukrainian ports or even sink civilian cargo ships carrying grain abroad. The Turkish leader had said exports of grain from Ukraine would continue with or without Russian approval and appears to have brokered the Russian climbdown. Russian attacks were reported across large areas of Ukraine on Thursday, with heavy shelling in numerous regions damaging infrastructure, including electricity supplies to Europe’s largest nuclear plant, Ukrainian officials said. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has again been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, Ukraine nuclear firm Energoatom said. The plant, in Russian hands but operated by Ukrainian workers, has 15 days’ worth of fuel to run the generators, Energoatom said. Russian strikes were also reported in Kryvyi Rih, in central Ukraine, and in Sumy and Kharkiv, in the north-east. Heavy fighting was ongoing in the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. “The enemy is trying to keep the temporarily captured territories, concentrating its efforts on restraining the actions of the Defence Forces in certain areas,” Ukraine’s general staff said on Thursday. Russia has said it targeted infrastructure as part of what it calls its “special military operation” to degrade the Ukrainian military and remove what it says is a potential threat against Russia’s security. As a result, Ukrainian civilians have endured power cuts and reduced water supplies in recent weeks. Russia denies targeting civilians, though the conflict has killed thousands, displaced millions and left some Ukrainian cities in ruins. Foreign ministers from the G7 group of rich democracies will discuss how best to coordinate further support for Ukraine when they meet on Thursday in Germany following recent Russian attacks on energy infrastructure.

Supply met demand and the lights stayed on. National Grid did not even have to deploy the two coal-fired plants that it had instructed to get warmed up. Those plants, remember, are only intended to be used as a last resort “when all commercial options have been exhausted”. In this case, the commercial option of paying through the nose to secure balancing supplies from French nuclear stations, or elsewhere, must have been available. The bad news is that it’s only mid-December and there may be more cold and calm days ahead this winter. Indeed, some figures in the energy industry were surprised that National Grid even got as far as putting the coal plants on emergency standby. They had assumed an alert would be more likely to be triggered by, say, an unexpected outage within the UK’s nuclear power fleet (which was humming at full capacity on Monday for the first time this winter). Not for the first time, then, we have cause to regret that successive UK governments allowed the UK’s gas storage capacity to dwindle. For about a decade and a half before the mothballing of Centrica’s Rough facility off east Yorkshire in 2017, ministers operated under the delusion that the market would always provide short, medium and long-term supplies at reasonable prices. Even as late as 2019, the business and energy department officially fretted that subsidies for storage would undermine the economics of LNG terminals and interconnectors to the continent. The bet was reckless in many ways, one of which was the inability to change course quickly if events do not pan out as expected. Amid the fanfare that has surrounded the reopening of Rough, don’t lose sight of the fact that its capacity will be only 30bn cubic feet this winter, which is about three days’ reserves at peak demand. Once upon a time, Rough could hold five times as much. Sadly, it’s not possible to flick a switch and get the old capacity back. Centrica reckons a £150m investment, with any losses underwritten by a government contract in effect, would get Rough to 60bn cubic feet of gas by next winter. Then the company talks about a grander £1bn vision to restore Rough properly, or £2bn to allow eventual conversion to become the world’s largest hydrogen storage facility. The big and long-term investment decisions may not have to be taken immediately, but it’s not too soon to plan for next winter. The UK has a lot of storage capacity to recover. Centrica’s negotiating hand is improving with the icy weather. LSEG’s tie-up with Microsoft risks blurred lines A ten-year “strategic partnership” with one of the world’s largest technology companies was always going to be given maximum hype by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). And, sure enough, chief executive David Schwimmer reached for the superlatives to describe the tie-up with Microsoft: a “significant milestone” that will “transform the experience” for LSEG customers and “meaningfully” boost revenues, he said. Since LSEG didn’t define “meaningful”, it’s hard to know what the financial yardstick for success is supposed to be. But, yes, this is a clearly a serious attempt by the LSEG to upgrade Refinitiv, the international data business it bought in 2020 for $27bn (£22bn), and close the “credibility gap”, as analysts put it, with Bloomberg’s instant-messaging capability. All being well, there’ll be less need for customers to flick between different programmes. And, having shelled out such a huge sum for Refinitiv, LSEG had to show a plan to accelerate growth. The odd part, though, is why Microsoft is also buying a 4% stake (from the Blackstone/Thomson Reuters consortium that was the seller in the all-share Refinitiv transaction) and being given a seat on the LSEG board. The intention, presumably, is to demonstrate that the deal is more than just a product-development gig, but the risk is a blurring of governance lines. Microsoft is at once a seller of services to LSEG – to the tune of a guaranteed $2.8bn over the next decade – and also in the happy position of having a representative in the boardroom of its customer. If sweet harmony prevails and a suite of impressive new analytical tools appears, there won’t be a problem. But the deal is not exclusive. LSEG can work with other tech firms, and Microsoft can sell elsewhere. If one side ends up disappointed in the others’ efforts, the governance set-up will look messy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-moscow-suspends-us-inspections-of-nuclear-arsenal-ukraine-reports-intense-shelling-in-donbas","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-09T18:00:04Z","webTitle":"One person killed after Ukraine appears to hit major Russian airbase in Crimea – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-moscow-suspends-us-inspections-of-nuclear-arsenal-ukraine-reports-intense-shelling-in-donbas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-moscow-suspends-us-inspections-of-nuclear-arsenal-ukraine-reports-intense-shelling-in-donbas","fields":{"headline":"One person killed after Ukraine appears to hit major Russian airbase in Crimea – as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is 9pm. Here is a summary of the day’s top news stories: The head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said one person had died as a result of the explosion earlier on Tuesday. Blasts rocked a Russian airbase near seaside resorts in the annexed Crimean peninsula, injuring five people according to local authorities. Witnesses told Reuters they heard at least 12 explosions at about 3.20pm local time from the Saky airbase near Novofedorivka on Crimea’s western coast. They described a final blast around 30 minutes later as the loudest. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power firm warned of the “very high” risks from shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-occupied south and said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in time for winter. Energoatom’s chief, Petro Kotin, told Reuters in an interview that last week’s Russian shelling had damaged three lines that connect the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Ukrainian grid and that Russia wanted to connect the facility to its grid. The leaders of Estonia and Finland want fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take holidays in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine. The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, wrote on Tuesday on Twitter that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right” and that it was “time to end tourism from Russia now”, the Associated Press reported. Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad has been struggling with quotas imposed by the EU for sanctioned goods that it can import across Lithuania from mainland Russia or Belarus, the region’s governor admitted. Lithuania infuriated Moscow in June by banning the land transit of goods such as concrete and steel to Kaliningrad after EU sanctions on them came into force, Reuters reported. Russia has launched an Iranian satellite from Kazakhstan amid concerns that it could be used for battlefield surveillance in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Iran has denied that the Khayyam satellite, which was delivered into orbit aboard a Soyuz rocket launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, would ever be under Russian control. Russia has suspended an arrangement that allowed US and Russian inspectors to visit each other’s nuclear weapons sites under the 2010 New Start treaty, in a fresh blow to arms control. Mutual inspections had been suspended as a health precaution since the start of the Covid pandemic, but a foreign ministry statement on Monday added another reason Russia is unwilling to restart them. It argued that US sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine stopped Russian inspectors travelling to the US. The global health aid agency Unitaid is donating 220 specialised portable breathing devices to Ukraine that can help save lives of premature babies even in frontline hospitals where there is no electrical power. During Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, hundreds of hospitals have been damaged or destroyed, disrupting supply lines and placing newborn babies at risk of death or disability from a lack of access to equipment and oxygen, Reuters reported. More than 10.5 million people have crossed the border from Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, the UN refugee agency UNHCR said on its website on Tuesday. Ukrainians have been fleeing their homes since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. In an interview, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said the advance of pro-Russian forces in the Donbas was developing in a northern direction, with fighting on the outskirts of Bakhmut and Soledar. He said that the DPR was in negotiations with Pyongyang to bring builders from North Korea in to help rebuild the occupied territory. Pushilin also stated that there would be an “open tribunal over the war criminals of Ukraine”, with the first to be held in Mariupol, which would feature the testimony of the “Azovites”, in reference to Ukraine’s Azov battalion. Russia’s assault towards the town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine has been its most successful axis in the Donbas region in the past month, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Despite this, it had only gained 10km in that time, while elsewhere in Donbas it had gained only 3km over 30 days – “almost certainly significantly less than planned”. That’s it for the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. I’ll be back tomorrow, see you then. A Russian airbase deep behind the frontline in Crimea was damaged by several large explosions on Tuesday afternoon, killing at least one person, although it was not immediately clear whether it had been targeted by a long range Ukrainian missile strike. Multiple social media videos showed explosions and clouds emerging from the Saky military base in Novofedorivka on the western coast of Crimea, prompting questions about how a location more than 100 miles from the frontline could have been attacked. Later a senior Ukrainian official appeared to claim responsibility, without giving details. Russia’s defence ministry told the RIA Novosti news agency that the explosions took place at about 3.20pm local time, and that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area. It said it was trying to discern the cause of the incident. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power firm warned of the “very high” risks of shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-occupied south and said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in time for winter. Energoatom’s chief, Petro Kotin, told Reuters in an interview that last week’s Russian shelling had damaged three lines that connect the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Ukrainian grid and that Russia wanted to connect the facility to its grid. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the site of the vast nuclear power station – Europe’s biggest – that lies in Russian-controlled territory, in recent days. Some of the shelling landed near storage facilities for spent fuel, an area that has 174 containers of highly radioactive material, Kotin said, warning of the dangers of them being hit. “This is … the most radioactive material in all the nuclear power plant. This would [mean] the distribution [of it] around this place and then we will have like a radiation cloud and then the weather will decide … which direction the cloud goes,” he said. “The risk is very high,” he said. Kotin said Russia wanted to connect the plant to its grid, a technically difficult process that requires the facility to be severed from the Ukrainian system before it can be gradually connected to the Russian one. The leaders of Estonia and Finland want fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take holidays in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine. Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, wrote on Tuesday on Twitter that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right” and that it is “time to end tourism from Russia now”, the Associated Press reported. A day earlier, her counterpart in Finland, Sanna Marin, told Finnish broadcaster YLE that “it is not right that while Russia is waging an aggressive, brutal war of aggression in Europe, Russians can live a normal life, travel in Europe, be tourists”. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, went further in a Washington Post interview on Monday, saying all western countries should ban Russian tourists. Estonia and Finland both border Russia and are members of the European Union, which banned air travel from Russia after it invaded Ukraine. But Russians can still travel by land to both countries and apparently are then taking flights to other European destinations. The Ukrainian military claims to have struck a major airbase deep inside the occupied Crimean peninsula. At least 12 explosions hit the Saky naval airbase, causing a huge plume of smoke. Russia has disputed the claims and says it was not an attack but a detonation of ammunition. The head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said one person has died as a result of the explosion earlier on Tuesday. Blasts rocked a Russian airbase near seaside resorts in the annexed Crimean peninsula, injuring five people according to local authorities. Witnesses told Reuters they heard at least 12 explosions at about 3.20pm local time from the Saky airbase near Novofedorivka on Crimea’s western coast. They described a final blast around 30 minutes later as the loudest. Russia’s defence ministry claimed the “detonation of several aviation ammunition stores” had caused an explosion, Russian news agencies reported, but that there had been no injuries. Russia has launched an Iranian satellite from Kazakhstan amid concerns that it could be used for battlefield surveillance in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Iran has denied that the Khayyam satellite, which was delivered into orbit aboard a Soyuz rocket launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, would ever be under Russian control. But the Washington Post had previously reported that Moscow told Tehran it “plans to use the satellite for several months, or longer, to enhance its surveillance of military targets” in Ukraine, according to two US officials. The satellite, named after the Persian poet and mathematician Omar Khayyam, was built by Russia and will include a high-resolution camera that would give Tehran new capabilities to monitor sensitive facilities in Israel and the Persian Gulf, the paper reported. Crimea’s emergency services said three people were injured as a result of the blast. The ministry of defence said earlier there were no casualties and no aircraft was damaged. The head of occupied Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said it was “too early” to talk about casualties, adding that medics were working on the ground. He said: Ambulance crews and medics are working on the spot, there are enough of them. It is too early to talk about casualties. Among the civilian population, no one has yet applied for medical assistance. Ukraine appears to have struck a major Russian airbase deep inside the occupied Crimean peninsula in what is being seen as a significant strike in a region regarded by Moscow as largely safe from attack. Video footage posted on Tuesday afternoon showed a series of large explosions at the Saky air force base located 200km behind the Russian front lines in Ukraine’s south. The Saky naval air station is located in Novofedorivka, and is the airbase associated with operations of Russian Black Sea fleet. What is significant about the attack is the distance of the location targeted behind Russian lines, suggesting both the use of ballistic missiles and that recent Ukrainian strikes on Russian air defences allowed the missiles to hit their target. Underlining the importance of the attack, Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at St Andrews University, tweeted: “What the Ukrainians are doing is extremely important. By showing they can hit Crimea, they will further stretch Russia defensive capabilities. The Russians are going to have to protect a huge area behind the front lines.” Reuters is carrying a little more details from the witness it has spoken to concerning the reports of explosions in Crimea. At least 12 explosions of varying intensity were heard in the course of a minute around 3.30pm local time, two witnesses said. Three were particularly loud, triggering sparks and smoke. (It is worth noting that the social media posts shared by Rodion Miroshnik placed the explosions slightly earlier, at 3pm local time – see post from 22 minutes ago) Around 30 minutes later, one more blast, described by witnesses as the loudest of all, triggered two more plumes of smoke and dust. In the nearby town of Saky, sirens blared. Reuters has distributed this image of the scene, which was taken from a third party. The Russian governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said in a post on his Telegram channel that he had gone to the area and that the “circumstances are being clarified”. An adviser to Aksyonov confirmed that explosions had occurred but declined to comment on the possible cause, Russian news agencies reported. Emergency services were deployed, the Tass news agency reported, citing the regional health ministry. Russia for decades leased the naval port of Sevastopol, home of its Black Sea Fleet, from Kyiv, but in 2014 annexed the entire peninsula from Ukraine in a move not recognised by most other countries. On Telegram, the Russian Tass news agency has posted that “the Association of Tour Operators of Russia said that the explosion in the Crimea occurred far from the resort area. There were no casualties or injuries among the tourists.” Authorities in Crimea appear to have been confirming reports of explosions in the region, although details are still scant. Oleg Kryuchkov, a Kremlin-appointed adviser to the authorities in Crimea, has posted to Telegram to say: “So far, I can only confirm the very fact of several explosions in the Novofedorivka area. I ask everyone to wait for official reports.” The BBC reports that pro-Russian military commander Yuri Kotenok said on his Telegram channel that there were about 10 explosions. “20km from Novofedorivka windows tremble and alarms go off in cars,” he wrote. It quotes another local authority figure as saying: “Our airfield is exploding. Explosions are at the airfield. All the windows here have been shattered.” The video clips which purport to show explosions in Crimea are being shared by pro-Russian social media as well as Ukrainian social media Rodion Miroshnik, who goes under the title of the ambassador to Russia for the self-proclaimed and chiefly unrecognised Luhansk People’s Republic, has forwarded a message on Telegram featuring two videos and a still image of the apparent explosions, accompanied by the message: Residents of Crimea report explosions near the village of Novofedorivka. The first explosion occurred at about 15:00 local time. There were a few more after it. Whether there are victims is unknown. Three local witnesses have told Reuters they heard several loud explosions and seen black smoke rising from the direction of a Russian military airbase at Novofedorivka in western Crimea on Tuesday. Videos shared on social media also showed a plume of smoke in the area. Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. More details soon … Global health aid agency Unitaid is donating 220 specialised portable breathing devices to Ukraine that can help save lives of premature babies even in frontline hospitals where there is no electrical power. During Russia’s invasion of Ukraine hundreds of hospitals have been damaged or destroyed, disrupting supply lines and placing newborn babies at risk of death or disability from a lack of access to equipment and oxygen, Reuters reported. Herve Verhoosel, a spokesperson for Unitaid, told a media briefing that the war was causing extra stress on pregnant women, leading to an increase in the number of premature births, which had tripled in some areas. The new bubble nasal continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) devices are available in 25 facilities across Ukraine, Verhoosel said. Unitaid funds medical innovation programmes mainly in poor countries, and is hosted by the World Health Organization. WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said that on a recent visit to a paediatric hospital close to the frontline in Ukraine she had seen medical staff who sleep in the basement every night, and constantly have to move children on ventilation machines. “So having very portable devices that can function offline is absolutely critical,” she told the briefing. Unitaid partnered with Vayu Global Health, a non-profit that specialises in low-cost healthcare equipment for developing countries, to provide the Kenya-made bCPAP machines, which cost about $500 each, as well as 125 oxygen blender systems. Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad has been struggling with quotas imposed by the European Union for sanctioned goods that it can import across Lithuania from mainland Russia or Belarus, the region’s governor admitted. Lithuania infuriated Moscow in June by banning the land transit of goods such as concrete and steel to Kaliningrad after EU sanctions on them came into force, Reuters reported. As part of a deal reached in July, the EU imposed limits on the volume of such goods crossing by land between Kaliningrad and mainland Russia or Belarus, based on average volumes over the last three years, to prevent Kaliningrad being used to dodge sanctions. Kaliningrad governor Anton Alikhanov estimated that the limits permit Russia to ship around 500,000 tonnes of sanctioned goods in total in both directions each year. But he said some quotas had already been reached, making it impossible, for instance, for Kaliningrad to import cement from Belarus – which used to account for around 200,000 tonnes a year. Moscow says trade with its outlying territory should not be subject to limits. “Today, we have already exhausted the limits set by Europeans for the transportation of goods by rail: for instance, certain kinds of iron, steel, oil products, fertilisers, antifreeze and timber,” Russian news agencies quoted Alikhanov as saying at a meeting of the Valdai discussion club on Tuesday. Russia’s former ambassador to Lithuania said that, while the transit deal had helped avoid the “worst case scenario”, the situation was “far from normal”. More than 10.5 million people have crossed the border from Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said on its website on Tuesday. Ukrainians have been fleeing their homes since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. Russia’s defence ministry said on Tuesday that Russian forces had destroyed an ammunition depot near Uman in Ukraine storing US-made Himars missiles and M777 howitzers, the RIA Novosti news agency reported. The Reuters news agency was unable to verify the battlefield reports. In its daily briefing, the ministry said it had destroyed more than 300 rockets in the strike. Kyiv has hailed the arrival of the advanced, long-range Himars from the United States as a possible game-changer, while Moscow has accused the West of “dragging out” the conflict by arming Ukraine. Russia has suspended an arrangement that allowed US and Russian inspectors to visit each other’s nuclear weapons sites under the 2010 New Start treaty, in a fresh blow to arms control. Mutual inspections had been suspended as a health precaution since the start of the Covid pandemic, but a foreign ministry statement on Monday added another reason Russia is unwilling to restart them. It argued that US sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine stopped Russian inspectors travelling to the US. Ukraine has reported intense Russian shelling across the frontlines on Tuesday as both sides traded blame for the weekend strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex that triggered international concern about a potential atomic disaster. Heavy fighting was reported in frontline towns near the eastern city of Donetsk, where Ukrainian officials said Russian troops were launching waves of attacks. In an interview, the self-appointed leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin, said the advance of pro-Russian forces in the Donbas is developing in a northern direction, with fighting going on on the outskirts of Bakhmut and Soledar. He said that the DPR was in negotiations with Pyongyang to bring builders from North Korea in to help rebuild the occupied territory. Pushilin also stated that there would be an “open tribunal over the war criminals of Ukraine”, with the first to be held in Mariupol, which would feature the testimony of the “Azovites”, in reference to Ukraine’s Azov battalion. Russia’s assault towards the town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine has been its most successful axis in the Donbas region in the past month, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Despite this, it had gained only 10km in that time, while elsewhere in Donbas it had gained only 3km over 30 days – “almost certainly significantly less than planned”. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-imposed military-civilian administration in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, has said: “Kherson region is ready to repel the attempts of the offensive by Ukrainian militants, if such a criminal order is given. Reliable protection of the borders of the region is provided by the Russian ministry of defence.” Two further grain-carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Chornomorsk port on Tuesday, as part of the deal to unblock Ukrainian sea exports. The Ocean Lion, which departed for South Korea, is carrying 64,720 tonnes of corn, it said, while the Rahmi Yağcı is carrying 5,300 tonnes of sunflower meal to Istanbul. Four ships that left Ukraine earlier are anchored near Istanbul and will be inspected on Tuesday, the Turkish defence ministry said. Belarus, where Russian troops were positioned to hold joint exercises before they invaded Ukraine from the north in February, has announced it is to hold live fire military training exercises both in Belarus and in Russia during August. Russia launched an Iranian satellite into orbit on Tuesday on morning, but Tehran has sought to deflect suspicions that Moscow could use Khayyam to improve its surveillance of military targets in Ukraine. The US believes Russia has suffered between 70,000 and 80,000 casualties, either killed or wounded, since its latest invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon’s top policy official, said: “The Russians are taking a tremendous number of casualties on the other side of the equation. I think it’s safe to suggest that the Russians are probably taking 70-80,000 casualties in less than six months.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has again accused the Russian Federation of terrorism. He posted to Telegram a selection of images showing damage to buildings and wheat fields in Ukraine with the message: The only difference between terrorists and Russia is that the first ones take responsibility for what they have done, while Russia does not have the courage to do so and has the audacity to blame others for its crimes – individual countries and the whole world. And now this world faces a choice. Determination, and therefore – an end to the crimes and atrocities of Russia, or another explosion of another bomb from these terrorists. The Telegram channel of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) is carrying a summary of an interview conducted with self-appointed leader Denis Pushilin. In it, he claims that the advance of pro-Russian forces in the Donbas is developing in a northern direction, with fighting going on on the outskirts of Bakhmut and Soledar. In Pisky, he said, “the cleanup is being completed”. Pushilin repeated the allegation that the deaths of Ukrainian prisoners of war at a Russian-controlled prison in Olenivka were caused by Ukrainian forces, saying: “Its implementation was controlled from the decision-making centres in Ukraine”. Ukraine has claimed the opposite, with satellite images suggesting that the building was destroyed not by a Himars strike from outside but either by a precision strike or by a detonation inside. He said the DPR was in negotiations with Pyongyang to bring in builders from North Korea to help rebuild the occupied territory. Pushilin also stated that there would be an “open tribunal over the war criminals of Ukraine”, with the first to be held in Mariupol, which would feature the testimony of the “Azovites”, in reference to Ukraine’s Azov battalion. The comments were made during a 20-minute section of Vladimir Solovyov’s live show. Only Russia, Syria and North Korea recognise the DPR as a legitimate authority, or Pushilin as a legitimate leader. Belarus, where Russian troops were positioned to hold joint exercises before they invaded Ukraine from the north in February, has announced it is to hold military training exercises during August. Reuters reports the defence ministry said the exercises will involve live firing and be held in two stages, firstly from 9-11 August in Belarus, and then at the Ashuluk training base in Russia from 22-25 August. The Ashuluk testing range is in the Astrakhan region of southern Russia, which borders Kazakhstan and the Caspian Sea. On Telegram, Ukraine’s emergency services have detailed some of the evacuation work it carried out in the last 24 hours. It said: Over the past day, emergency workers evacuated six people from Kramatorsk and Bakhmut districts. Rescuers from Donetsk region also helped 102 people during the evacuation in the city of Toretsk, including 10 children and 10 people with disabilities. During the evacuation at the railway station in Pokrovsk, assistance was provided to 735 people, including 69 children and nine people with physical disabilities. Also updating the public on evacuation numbers, Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, said 161 people arrived in his region from the east of the country on two evacuation trains in the last 24 hours. He stated that 747 people departed from the Lviv region to Przemyśl in Poland. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has issued its military briefing for the day. It says that Ukrainian forces shelled 10 of the 266 settlements that it claims to have “liberated” from Ukraine alongside Russia and the similarly self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic. The DPR is recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states including Russia, and its claims have not been independently verified. Here is an image sent to us over the newswires of the Liberian-flagged ship Ocean Lion, which departed from Ukraine’s Chornomorsk earlier today carrying 64,720 tonnes of corn. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukraine’s mayor of the occupied city of Sievierodonetsk, has been speaking on Ukrainian television about what he knows of the the conditions there. He described the situation, saying that occupation authorities are trying to create a picture of the restoration of normal life, and teams are being formed in the city to clean the streets, with the offer of food as payment for labour. He claimed there is no running water and the sewage system does not work either. He said the city lacks the specialists to restore communications. He also claimed that almost all the people who tried to return to the city, stayed there for several days, then realised that it would be impossible to overwinter in these conditions, and they left again. A clip of Stryuk’s interveiw was posted to Telegram by Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, Serhai Haidai. The claims have not been independently verified. NewsGuard, a New York-based firm that studies and tracks online misinformation, has identified 250 websites actively spreading Russian disinformation about the war, with dozens of new sites added in recent months. They appear to be part of a concerted effort to circumvent the European Union’s efforts to block Russian propaganda and misinformation about the war. Claims on these sites include allegations that Ukraine’s army has staged some deadly Russian attacks to generate global support, that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is faking public appearances, or that Ukrainian refugees are committing crimes in Germany and Poland. Some of the sites pose as independent thinktanks or news outlets. About half are English-language, while others are in French, German or Italian. Many were set up long before the war and were not obviously tied to the Russian government until they suddenly began echoing Kremlin talking points. “They may be establishing sleeper sites,” said NewsGuard co-CEO Gordon Crovitz. Sleeper sites are websites created for a disinformation campaign that lay largely dormant, slowly building an audience through innocuous or unrelated posts, and then switching to propaganda or disinformation at an appointed time. While NewsGuard’s analysis found that much of the disinformation about the war in Ukraine is coming from Russia, it did find instances of false claims with a pro-Ukrainian slant. YouTube, TikTok and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, all pledged to remove RT and Sputnik from their platforms within the European Union. But the Associated Press reports that researchers have found that in some cases all Russia had to do to evade the ban was to post the same content from a different account. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-imposed military-civilian administration in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, has spoken to the RIA Novosti news agency. He said that the forces in occupied Kherson are ready to defend themselves against any attempt by the Ukrainians to retake the region. It quotes him saying: The Kherson region is ready to repel the attempts of the offensive by Ukrainian militants, if such a criminal order is given to them by the regime of Zelenskiy, who is ready to wage war to the last Ukrainian for the sake of destroying the country. Reliable protection of the borders of the region is provided by the Russian ministry of defence. Here are some of the latest images to be distributed from Ukraine on the newswires. Reuters reports that the Turkish defence ministry has said two further grain-carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Chornomorsk port on Tuesday, as part of the deal to unblock Ukrainian sea exports. The Ocean Lion, which departed for South Korea, is carrying 64,720 tonnes of corn, it said, while the Rahmi Yağcı is carrying 5,300 tonnes of sunflower meal to Istanbul. The four ships that left Ukraine earlier are anchored near Istanbul and will be inspected on Tuesday, the defence ministry statement said. Rodion Miroshnik, who is styled as the ambassador to Russia for the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, has claimed on Telegram that four people were killed yesterday in the territory occupied by the similarly self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic in occupied Ukraine. He also states that 17 more were injured “of which one was blown up by a PFM-1 ‘petal’ mine”. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine is a signatory to the 1997 Ottawa convention, which aims to prohibit the stockpiling and use of anti-personnel mines such as the Soviet-designed PFM-1. Russia is not. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged western nations to ban entry of all Russian citizens. In an interview with the Washington Post, Zelenskiy said the most important sanctions against Russia would be to close borders, “because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. He said Russians should “live in their own world until they change their philosophy”. Russia’s assault towards the town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine has been its most successful axis in the Donbas region in the past month, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Despite this, it had only gained 10km in that time, while elsewhere in Donbas it had gained only 3km over 30 days – “almost certainly significantly less than planned”. With Russia and Ukraine trading accusations over endangering the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, and the head of the UN saying that attacks on the station were “suicidal”, we prepared this explainer on what’s at stake. Russia is scheduled to launch an Iranian satellite into orbit on Tuesday, but Tehran has brushed off fears that Moscow might use it in the war against Ukraine. Iran’s Khayyam satellite is scheduled to take off from the Moscow-operated Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 05:52 GMT, three weeks after Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, met Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Tehran. Iran has sought to deflect suspicions that Moscow could use Khayyam to improve its surveillance of military targets in Ukraine. Last week, the Washington Post quoted anonymous western intelligence officials as saying that Russia “plans to use the satellite for several months or longer” to assist its war efforts before allowing Iran to take control. But the Iranian Space Agency said on Sunday that the Islamic republic would control the Khayyam satellite “from day one”. The US believes Russia has suffered between 70,000 and 80,000 casualties, either killed or wounded, since its invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon’s top policy official said: “The Russians are taking a tremendous number of casualties on the other side of the equation. I think it’s safe to suggest that the Russians are probably taking 70 or 80,000 casualties in less than six months.” Kahl admitted that the Ukraine side also had significant losses of manpower on the battlefield, but gave no figures. “Both sides are taking casualties. The war is the most intense conventional conflict in Europe since the second world war,” he said. Ukraine has reported intense Russian shelling across the frontlines on Tuesday as both sides traded blame for the weekend strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex that triggered international concern about a potential atomic disaster. Heavy fighting was reported in frontline towns near the eastern city of Donetsk, where Ukrainian officials said Russian troops were launching waves of attacks. “The situation in the region is tense - shelling is constant throughout the front line ... The enemy is also using air strikes a great deal,” Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko told Ukrainian television. “The enemy is having no success. Donetsk region is holding.” In the south-east, the key Antonovsky bridge over the Dnieper River in Kherson region was targeted again by Ukrainian forces trying to disrupt Russian supply lines. Yuri Sobolevsky, deputy head of Kherson regional council ousted by Russian occupation forces, said on Telegram the bridge had been seriously damaged after “overnight actions”. Good morning, and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These are the latest developments Ukraine has arrested two people working for Russian intelligence services who planned to kill the Ukrainian defence minister and the head of the country’s military intelligence agency, Ukraine’s domestic security service said on Monday. The security service of Ukraine foiled the plot by the Russian GRU military intelligence agency to use a sabotage group to carry out three murders including that of a prominent Ukrainian activist, the agency said. The US will provide an additional $4.5bn (£3.7bn) to Ukraine’s government, bringing its total budgetary support since Russia’s February invasion to $8.5bn (£7bn), the US Agency for International Development has announced. The funding, coordinated with the US Treasury Department through the World Bank, will go to Ukraine’s government in tranches, beginning with a $3bn (£2.5bn) disbursement in August, USAid, the Agency for International Development, said. Russia has suspended an arrangement that allowed US and Russian inspectors to visit each other’s nuclear weapons sites under the 2010 New Start treaty, in a fresh blow to arms control. Mutual inspections had been suspended as a health precaution since the start of the Covid pandemic, but a foreign ministry statement on Monday added another reason Russia is unwilling to restart them. It argued that US sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine stopped Russian inspectors travelling to the US. It is highly likely Russia is deploying anti-personnel mines to protect and deter freedom of movement along its defensive lines in Donetsk and Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. The ministry called the PFM-1 and PFM-1S mines – also known as “butterfly mines” – “deeply controversial and indiscriminate weapons” with the potential to inflict widespread casualties among both the military and the local civilian population. Two more ships, carrying corn and soybeans, departed Ukrainian ports, taking the total to 10 ships carrying Ukrainian grain exports since the UN deal to unblock Ukraine’s grain exports was struck, Reuters reported. Future ships exporting Ukraine grain through the Black Sea will now be protected by a 10 nautical mile buffer zone, according to long-awaited procedures agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations. The first grain carrying ship to depart Ukrainian ports after the UN-brokered deal is looking for another port to unload its cargo after the initial Lebanese buyer refused delivery due to its five-month delay, Reuters reported. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom has called for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to be made a military-free zone, warning of the risk of a Chornobyl-style nuclear disaster after shelling of the site caused a reactor to shut down on Saturday. Russia and Ukraine continue to trade accusations over is responsible for the shelling, with the UN calling for international inspectors to be given access. According to reports from the head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region, the nuclear power station is currently operating normally. The Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree on Monday providing for a referendum on joining Russia, in the latest sign that Moscow is moving ahead with its plans to annex seized Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has ruled out any peace talks with Russia if the country proceeds with referendums in the occupied areas. The Kremlin said on Monday there was no basis for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents at the moment. Negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv have been stalled for months, with each side blaming the other for a lack of progress, Reuters reports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/ukraine-backs-plan-for-international-tribunal-to-try-putin-for-of-aggression","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T15:13:02Z","webTitle":"Ukraine backs international tribunal plan to try Putin for crime of aggression","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/ukraine-backs-plan-for-international-tribunal-to-try-putin-for-of-aggression","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/ukraine-backs-plan-for-international-tribunal-to-try-putin-for-of-aggression","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine backs international tribunal plan to try Putin for crime of aggression","bodyText":"Ukraine’s foreign minister has backed the establishment of a special international tribunal to try Russia’s leaders for the crime of aggression against Ukrainians. The move is separate from the claim launched by 39 countries this week to hold Russia to account at the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, is starting an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the conduct of the war. The crime of aggression, by contrast, would give rise to prosecution under international law by allowing the instigators of the aggression to be put on trial regardless of how the war was conducted. The ICC cannot also have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, unless the Russian state agrees, which it would veto at the UN. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, speaking from the back of a car in Ukraine via video link to an event at London’s Chatham House on Friday, said: “We are fighting against an enemy that is much stronger than us. But international law is on our side, and hopefully it will make its own contribution to help us prevail. The question now is how the international community will respond. “An international tribunal will fill a gap. When bombs fall on your cities, when Russian soldiers rape women in the occupied cities, it is difficult to talk of the efficiency of international law. But it is the only tool of civilisation that is available to us so in the end all those that made this war possible are held to account. We need to fill the gap of the crime against aggression.” He recalled that 80 years ago representatives from nine nations met in London to set up a legal framework for the prosecution of war criminals of the second world war. The former prime minister Gordon Brown, one of the advocates of the plan, said the possibility of bringing Vladimir Putin to trial was realistic. He said the tribunal, modelled on the Nuremberg trials after the second world war, would investigate all those who planned the invasion and were complicit, including by providing finance. Brown said: “Buildings are being razed to the ground but not the spirit of the Ukrainian people, and by acting in solidarity with them we will signal that lawless aggression will not be tolerated anywhere on European soil.” The call on nations to agree to set up the tribunal has support from international lawyers, barristers and former judges, including Richard Goldstone, the former chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Philippe Sands QC said it was clear that sanctions alone would not work. “If we are committed to standing up to a lawless naked act of aggression, we must not leave a stone unturned. When Charles de Gaulle met in London in 1942 it must have been unimaginable that Hitler would be put in the dock three years later.” He implied the existence of the tribunal might in itself weaken the support base of the Russian president, saying: “The imminence of the Nuremberg trials in 1945 led some in the inner circle to ask, ‘Do I really want to be associated with this? Am I willing to break ranks and to cut deals?’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/22/bp-declines-reveal-how-much-loophole-saved-windfall-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-22T17:57:11Z","webTitle":"BP declines to reveal how much ‘loophole’ saved it in windfall tax ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/22/bp-declines-reveal-how-much-loophole-saved-windfall-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/22/bp-declines-reveal-how-much-loophole-saved-windfall-tax","fields":{"headline":"BP declines to reveal how much ‘loophole’ saved it in windfall tax ","bodyText":"BP declined to reveal how much windfall tax it would have paid without an investment “loophole” when being questioned by MPs on Tuesday, while fellow energy group SSE raised concerns the levy “favours” oil and gas drilling over renewables projects. Appearing before MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee, the BP vice-president Matthew Williamson said he did not know how much the firm would have paid without an investment allowance that reduces the windfall tax due if a company invests in North Sea oil and gas extraction. He also declined to say how much BP was spending on renewable energy projects this year. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, last week slashed the investment allowance. Companies can only reduce their windfall tax bill by 29% of funds invested in extraction, down from the previous 80% discount. Hunt also increased the tax rate of the levy from 25% to 35% and extended its lifetime by two years. In a testy exchange, the BEIS committee chair, Darren Jones, asked: “If it wasn’t for the loophole that was put in for investment into drilling for further oil and gas, how much more tax would you have paid this financial year?” Williamson replied: “Our tax and financial teams will be working that out so I don’t have an answer for that today.” Jones also asked how the $8.5bn (£7.15bn) BP has earmarked to buy back its own shares compares with its investment in low carbon technology. Williamson said: “All I can say is for this year we’re looking at approximately 30% of spend for non-hydrocarbon investment, I don’t have the breakdown for renewables.” Jones said the questions had been sent to BP before the hearing and said he was “shocked” Williamson could not answer them. Jones asked whether Williamson had requested the numbers from his team. “No I did not,” Williamson said. The scale of BP’s investment in renewables projects has been under the spotlight this year. The company has committed to spend £18bn in the UK by the end of the decade but has been urged to reinvest booming profits in greater spending on green energy. BP invested £300m into renewables and “low carbon” projects in the first half of 2022 – the equivalent of just 2.5% of its £12.2bn profits. BP said this month that it expected to pay $2.5bn as a result of the windfall tax, known as the energy profits levy, before it was updated by Hunt. Rival Shell caused anger when it said it had paid no windfall tax because of heavy spending on oil and gas drilling. Separately, the chancellor introduced a 45% levy on electricity generators aimed at the “excess returns” seen by renewable and nuclear power companies as electricity is tied to soaring gas prices. Catherine Raw, the managing director of the power firm SSE’s thermal division, told MPs the investment allowance for oil and gas firms risked Britain’s efforts to decarbonise the energy industry. Raw said: “It feels like an unintended consequence and slightly counterintuitive that effectively investment by oil and gas companies is favoured to investment by renewables companies.” Raw called for the government to speed up plans to help power firms build business models that incorporate hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. Asked whether the UK was on track to phase out “unabated gas”, without attached carbon storage project by 2035, Raw said: “If we continue at the pace we’re at today, the answer is probably no.” She said: “When we look at our own fleet we see two power stations continue to operate post-2030.” She said the phase-out over other power stations would rely on the development of hydrogen and CCS. Will Gardiner, the chief executive of Drax, was forced to defend the £11bn in renewable subsidies it is expected to have collected by 2027. The subsidy for the UK’s largest power station was called “utterly bizarre” by Dr Daniel Quiggin, a researcher at the Chatham House thinktank who also appeared before the committee. Gardiner said: “We’ve reduced the emissions from 20m tonnes or more to around three and I think that’s a significant achievement for the UK and we’ve contributed to the decarbonisation effectively using the system the government has designed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/russian-soldiers-ukraine-anger-duped-into-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T05:00:28Z","webTitle":"Demoralised Russian soldiers tell of anger at being ‘duped’ into war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russian-soldiers-ukraine-anger-duped-into-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/russian-soldiers-ukraine-anger-duped-into-war","fields":{"headline":"Demoralised Russian soldiers tell of anger at being ‘duped’ into war","bodyText":"Five Russian soldiers sit in a brick building. They are blindfolded: the latest prisoners to be captured inside Ukraine. A Ukrainian voice interrogates them. “Speak,” he says to the group’s Russian officer. What message would he like to send to his soldiers and to Russians back at home? “Frankly speaking, they tricked us,” the officer replies, referring to his military superiors sitting in Moscow. “Everything we were told was a fake. I would tell my guys to leave Ukrainian territory. We’ve got families and children. I think 90% of us would agree to go home.” The three-minute video was filmed under conditions of duress. The soldiers are evidently scared. And yet there are numerous similar interviews with Russian captives which have been circulating on Ukrainian social media channels, expressing similar sentiments. Asked what he would tell his commanders, one said bluntly: “They are faggots”. Another phrase frequently used is oni obmanuli nas: they duped us. Eight days after Vladimir Putin’s invasion it is clear that a significant number of his servicemen are demoralised and reluctant to fight. Some have given themselves up. Others have abandoned their vehicles and have set off back towards the Russian border on foot, lugging their weapons and kitbags, videos suggest. These episodes do not mean that the Kremlin will fail in its attempts to conquer Ukraine, as its tactics shift to brutal shelling of civilians. But low morale among invading troops might be one reason why Russia’s blitzkrieg plan to overwhelm Ukraine appears not to have progressed at the speed Putin would have wanted. The assumption in Moscow was that the operation would be swift and successful. Soldiers were given food and fuel supplies for only two or three days, the videos suggest. The Kremlin also appears to have had a totally fantastical idea of the reception they would get. Several prisoners of war said they had been assured Ukrainians would welcome them as liberators. Russian forces were expecting flowers and cheers, not bullets and bombs, they said. “Some of them thought they were on military exercises. They didn’t anticipate resistance,” Artem Mazhulin, a 31-year-old English teacher from Kharkiv said. “A lot are conscripts born in 2002 or 2003. We are talking about 19-year-old and 20-year-old boys.” He added: “Since 2014 the Russian government has been brainwashing its population with propaganda. They try and make Russia believe Ukraine is not a real country and say fascist monsters have captured it.” Mazhulin said his uncle and aunt, Viktor and Valentina, had talked with Russian soldiers when they rolled past their house in Kupiansk, in north-east Ukraine, close to the border. The soldiers explained they were looking for Banderivtsi, or followers of the second world war Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera. “My uncle said to them: ‘Where the fuck do you see Banderivtsi?’ My aunt told them to get off her flowerbeds,” Mazhulin recounted. “They called my uncle Batya (Dad) and chatted with him about pigeon breeding, his hobby. Then they drove off on their tank.” In a video address on Thursday Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy pressed home the same message: that Putin has sent his invading forces into Ukraine without an understandable mission. “They are demoralised. They are doomed,” he said, telling enemy soldiers to “go home”. Ukraine claims to have killed several thousand Russian troops. This figure may be an exaggeration, but on Wednesday, however, even the Kremlin admitted 498 of its servicemen had died, with 1,591 wounded. Alex Kovzhun, a one-time adviser to Ukraine’s former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, said Russian soldiers could be divided into two sorts: “There are the young conscripts who are scared shitless. And there are career guys who have fought in Syria and the Donbas.” Kovzhun said the Russian general staff had thought the invasion would be “easy peasy”, and a repeat of the operations to seize Crimea in 2014, or their recent deployment to Kazakhstan, which were largely unopposed. Instead, Ukrainian civilians had stood in front of enemy tanks, blocked armoured columns with their bare hands and had sung the national anthem in front of twitchy Russian guards. “They shout expletives in front of armed people. I’ve seen the Russian faces. They are very uncomfortable because it’s not what they expected. They were told Ukrainians were imprisoned by mythic Nazis,” he added. Nick Reynolds, a research analyst for land warfare at the defence and security think tank the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), said the Ukrainian figure for killed enemy soldiers was likely to be a more reliable than the Russian estimate, adding that the footage of engagements involving Russian forces available online suggested the toll the Kremlin was willing to admit to had already been exceeded. Nevertheless, he added, there is little to show how the Ukrainian authorities have arrived at their own total. The several thousand dead tally could itself be a slight exaggeration, he said. There is no doubt Ukraine is utilising the discomfort of captured soldiers for propaganda purposes. Several videos show young men calling their mothers back in Russia, who have no idea their sons are fighting in Ukraine. The mothers typically break down. The Ukrainian authorities have opened a hotline for worried Russian relatives, in another PR scoop. Nonetheless, there is an authentic sense that many Russian servicemen regret ever having come to Ukraine, a journey that has ended for some in death or disillusionment. One interrogator asks a prisoner: “So, what do you think, are you soldiers of the strong Russian army or cannon fodder?” “We are cannon fodder,” the PoW replies. “Was it worth it?” the interrogator says, by way of follow-up. “No,” the prisoner says.

Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said shelling had destroyed the switchyard of a nearby thermal power plant. The plant has supplied power to the nuclear facility each time its normal supply lines had been cut over the past three weeks. The thermal plant was also supplying the surrounding area, which was plunged into darkness. Local Ukrainian officials said work was under way to restore the connection, which has been cut multiple times this week. Grossi, who said he had been informed of the situation by IAEA representatives at the plant, called for an “immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area”. “This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious,” he said, without apportioning blame for the shelling. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for shelling near Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine and within the perimeter of Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which has six reactors. The thermal supply has been cut and restored multiple times this week and Enerhodar, the nearby town, has suffered several complete blackouts. When the thermal supply has been cut the plant has relied on its only remaining operating reactor for the power needed for cooling and other safety functions. This method is designed to provide power only for a few hours at a time. Diesel generators are used as a last resort. The constant destruction of thermal power supply has led Ukraine to consider shutting down the remaining operating reactor, said Grossi. Ukraine “no longer [has] confidence in the restoration of offsite power”, he said. Grossi said that if Ukraine decided not to restore the offsite supply the entire power plant would be reliant on emergency diesel generators to ensure supplies for the nuclear safety and security functions. “As a consequence, the operator would not be able to restart the reactors unless offsite power was reliably re-established,” he said. Enerhodar’s mayor in exile, Dmytro Orlov, said on Friday that work was under way to fix the switchyard and restore the supply from the thermal plant to the town, most of which was still suffering a blackout. The development came as diplomats from Canada and Poland prepare to submit a draft resolution to be voted on by the IAEA’s board of governors, according to Reuters. The IAEA acts the international nuclear watchdog under the United Nations. The draft text, seen by Reuters, implores Russia to leave the power plant and for control over the plant to be given to the competent authorities within Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders. The text is expected to be passed, according to diplomats cited by Reuters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/04/london-stock-exchange-suspends-trading-in-more-russian-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T09:40:07Z","webTitle":"London Stock Exchange suspends trading in more Russian firms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/london-stock-exchange-suspends-trading-in-more-russian-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/04/london-stock-exchange-suspends-trading-in-more-russian-firms","fields":{"headline":"London Stock Exchange suspends trading in more Russian firms","bodyText":"The London Stock Exchange has suspended trading in more Russian companies, while an independent director resigned from the board of Evraz, the steel and mining group in which Roman Abramovich holds a 29% stake. The LSE suspended trading in the remaining eight companies with strong links to Russia that were not included on a list of 27 companies suspended on Thursday. The companies trade financial instruments in London, including global depositary receipts and American depositary receipts, but not ordinary shares, which are traded in on other stock exchanges where they have their primary listings. Also on Friday, Evraz – which has its primary listing in London and is incorporated in the UK – announced that James Rutherford had resigned from the board immediately. Rutherford was a non-executive director at Evraz for only nine months and also holds directorships at the mining groups Centamin and Anglo Pacific. His resignation came a day after the Institute of Directors urged British nationals to quit Russian boards, saying it was “no longer tenable” for them to remain after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, adding that any directors of Belarusian firms should also quit. Evraz also counts the former Ford executive Stephen Odell and Sir Michael Peat, a former private secretary to Prince Charles and whose family name is the “p” in KPMG, on its board. Peat, who was paid $224,000 (£168,232) last year, is due to stand down at the end of March, having been a board member since 2011. Rutherford was paid $125,000 from his appointment last June until the end of last year. Odell was paid $138,000. Evraz, which last week announced a dividend worth $450m to Abramovich, has so far not been caught in the sanctions being levelled at companies with strong links to Russia. On Thursday, the London Stock Exchange suspended trading in 27 companies, including the energy and banking firms Gazprom and Sberbank. The LSE said it was taking the action “in light of market conditions, and in order to maintain orderly markets”. On Friday, the LSE added the state-owned Federal Grid, Russia’s largest transmission company, the telecoms provider Rostelecom, the residential property developer Etalon, the supermarket chain O’Key, the fertiliser company Acron, the food retail chain Magnit, the investment firm Sistema and the commercial seaport Novorossiysk to its list of companies barred from trading in London. However, Evraz is one of a number of companies linked to Russia that have so far not been barred because they have been assigned “UK nationality” by the LSE for trading purposes. Nevertheless, international pressure is taking an increasing toll on Russian businesses, while the invasion of Ukraine is also disrupting those with operations in the region. On Wednesday, Evraz and the precious metals mining group Polymetal dropped out of the FTSE 100 in its quarterly review after their market values plummeted. The market value of Evraz has fallen by more than 80% since Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2022/mar/04/jennifer-griffin-fox-news-fact-checking-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T07:00:31Z","webTitle":"The Fox News journalist fact-checking channel’s pundits on air over Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/04/jennifer-griffin-fox-news-fact-checking-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/mar/04/jennifer-griffin-fox-news-fact-checking-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"The Fox News journalist fact-checking channel’s pundits on air over Ukraine","bodyText":"As Russia prepared to invade Ukraine, some hosts at the rightwing Fox News channel were passionately defending Vladimir Putin. Once Russian troops were in Ukraine, those same personalities, such as Tucker Carlson, swiftly began to blame Joe Biden for the invasion. That will not have surprised regular viewers of Fox, but what has raised eyebrows is the way that the views of hosts such as Carlson, the crew at the morning show Fox &amp; Friends, and the opinions of multiple Fox News guests have been corrected often in real time, by one of Fox News’ own journalists. Time and again over the past few days Jennifer Griffin, Fox News’ national security correspondent, has taken to the airwaves to directly contradict the messages of her colleagues and their guests. One former US brigadier general was dismissed on air by Griffin as “not a student of history” after he agitated for American intervention in Ukraine. A former military adviser to Donald Trump was described as a Putin “apologist” after suggesting Russia should be allowed to get on with subsuming Ukraine. It has brought Griffin, a widely respected journalist who joined Fox News in 1996 and spent three years as a reporter in Moscow, to the fore in the US, as non-Fox News viewers have been buoyed by her blunt dismissals. Last week Griffin had already corrected Fox &amp; Friends’ Steve Doocy and lectured the Fox News host Harris Faulkner about how Joe Biden stationing troops at Ukraine’s border would have given Putin “a pretext to go into Ukraine”, but the veteran journalist stepped it up in recent days as she apparently lost patience with the opinions of some of the Fox News punditocracy. Griffin’s first target was Don Bolduc, a retired army brigadier general who is running, for the second time, for the US Senate in New Hampshire. Bolduc, a vocal Trump supporter who has advanced the conspiracy theory that the former president won the 2020 election, appeared on Fox News on Saturday where he pushed for greater US military intervention in Ukraine. Enter Griffin. “I have to respond to something your previous guest, Brigadier General Bolduc, said, because he really was way off the mark in terms of talking about what the US could do on the ground,” she said. “Putin has nuclear weapons. That is why the US military and Nato do not have troops on the ground inside Ukraine.” Griffin continued: “Clearly, Brigadier General Bolduc is not a student of history – he’s a politician, he ran for Senate in New Hampshire and failed. He’s not a military strategist, and to suggest that the US would put indirect fire or special operations or CIA on the ground to give Putin any sort of excuse to broaden this conflict is extremely dangerous talk at a time like this.” The Bolduc burn came after Griffin had already stymied Sean Hannity’s efforts, two days before Russia’s invasion, to blame the crisis on Biden. “Sean, how we got to this point is a long story and it predates the Biden administration,” she said. “It goes back and includes mistakes made by every US president since the Soviet Union fell apart.” As Griffin’s reputation grew, she was asked about her fact-checking efforts on the Fox News show Media Buzz on Sunday. Howard Kurtz, the show’s host, referenced a Washington Post article headlined: “Jennifer Griffin keeps fact-checking her Fox News colleagues on Ukraine.” Kurtz said: “Now, I read that as you don’t want to get drawn into opinion debates. How do you see your role during this war?” Griffin, who joined Fox News in 1996, said: “I cover the news.” She added: “I’m here to fact-check facts because I report on facts. And my job is to try and figure out the truth as best as I know it. I share those facts internally so that our network can be more accurate. That’s what I’ve always done.” Hours after the Media Buzz appearance, Griffin was forced to return to the fact-checking, during an appearance on Trey Gowdy’s Fox News show. Gowdy, a former Republican congressman, had just been chatting with his guest, the former Trump military adviser Doug Macgregor, and Griffin had some thoughts. “I feel like I need to correct some of the things that Col Douglas Macgregor said, and I’m not sure that 10 minutes is enough time to do so, because there were so many distortions,” Griffin began. Macgregor, a former army colonel, had confidently told Gowdy that Putin had no intention of invading any other countries, and said the Russian president was merely “carrying through on something that he has been warning us about at least for the last 15 years”. Macgregor claimed that Russians and Ukrainians were “indistinguishable” from one another, and when asked whether Russia should be allowed to take as much of Ukraine as he likes, Macgregor said: “Yes, absolutely.” Griffin came on air and swiftly accused Macgregor of sounding like a Putin “apologist”: because “there were so many distortions in what he just said”. “I don’t think anyone I’ve spoken to at the Pentagon or elsewhere in western intelligence believes they know how far Putin wants to go,” she said. Griffin said that Macgregor, when an adviser to the Trump administration, had supported pulling US troops out of Germany. “That kind of projection of withdrawal and weakness is what made Putin think that he could actually move into a sovereign country like Ukraine,” she said. With no end to the Russian invasion in sight, it seems like Griffin will continue to have her work cut out for her. That was illustrated on Tuesday night when Carlson, Fox News’ most-watched host, wheeled Macgregor back on to the network and appeared to take a veiled swipe at Griffin. Carlson, whose recent defense of Putin was played on Russia 1 as Putin made his case to the Russian public for war, gave Macgregor the red carpet treatment, lavishing praise on the recently humbled former military man. “Unlike so many of the TV generals you see all day long, Macgregor is not angling for a board seat at Raytheon,” the Daily Beast quoted Carlson as saying. “Unlike many of the so-called reporters you see on television, he is not acting secretly as a flack for Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon. No, Doug Macgregor is an honest man.” After a brief interview with Macgregor, where the under-fire guest criticized Nato and questioned the amount of money being spent on supporting Ukraine, Carlson turned to the camera. “Doug Macgregor. A man you can believe,” Carlson said, defying Griffin’s earlier analysis that suggested quite the opposite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-160-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T10:16:58Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 160 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-160-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-160-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 160 of the invasion","bodyText":"The US announced on Monday a new tranche of weapons for Ukraine’s forces fighting Russia, including ammunition for increasingly important rocket launchers and artillery guns. The $550m package will “include more ammunition for the high mobility advanced rocket systems otherwise known as Himars, as well as ammunition” for artillery, national security council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has said that Russia had destroyed six US-made Himars missile systems since the beginning of the latest Russian invasion of Ukraine. Three people have reportedly been killed by Russian shelling while evacuating in a minibus near Kherson, Ukraine’s military is reporting. Ukraine’s Operational Command ‘South’ reported that three people died from the attack on the bus near Dovhove. Turkey’s representative at the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul has said that the first ship carrying Ukrainian grain to world markets was expected to anchor at Istanbul on Tuesday night. At a briefing held at the JCC, general Özcan Altunbulak said the course of the ship was going as planned. Another official said “The plan is for a ship to leave every day. If nothing goes wrong, exports will be made via one ship a day for a while.” Ukraine’s state security service says it is investigating 752 cases of treason and collaboration. According to the agency, the greatest amount of cases have been documented in the regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. The United Nations’ secretary general, António Guterres, has warned that a misunderstanding could spark nuclear destruction, as the US, Britain and France urged Russia to stop “its dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behaviour”. Sabina Higgins, the wife of Ireland’s president, Michael D Higgins, has triggered a political row in Ireland by urging Russia and Ukraine to call a ceasefire and enter negotiations. Critics said the intervention amounted to Kremlin propaganda because it appeared to equate Moscow’s aggression with Kyiv’s fight for survival. The US has accused Russia of using Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant as a “nuclear shield”. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Washington was “deeply concerned” that Moscow was now using the plant as a military base and firing on Ukrainian forces from around it and called Russia’s actions around the plant “the height of irresponsibility”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/10/ukraine-air-force-claims-russian-jets-destroyed-crimea-raid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-10T18:38:18Z","webTitle":"Ukraine air force claims up to a dozen Russian jets destroyed in Crimea raid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/10/ukraine-air-force-claims-russian-jets-destroyed-crimea-raid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/10/ukraine-air-force-claims-russian-jets-destroyed-crimea-raid","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine air force claims up to a dozen Russian jets destroyed in Crimea raid","bodyText":"Ukraine’s air force said it believed that up to a dozen Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground following Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which Russia said killed one, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine said the country had carried out the attack – but no public claim of responsibility was made by Kyiv of the incident that one expert believes may have been the product of a daring raid rather than a missile strike. Yuriy Ignat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, told national television that from studying video footage of the incident, it was clear “the aircraft weapons depot was hit”. He said: “And if additionally a dozen planes are destroyed there, it will be a real small victory.” The country’s air force also said on its Facebook page that “nine invader planes” had been destroyed in a short posting, although it did not specify in that message where or how it believed they had been eliminated. Ukraine’s president, Volodoymyr Zelenskiy, referred to the attack in his latest national address on Wednesday evening. “In just one day, the occupiers lost 10 combat aircraft: nine in Crimea and one more in the direction of Zaporizhzhia,” he said. “The occupiers also suffer new losses of armoured vehicles, warehouses with ammunition, logistics routes.” The claims could not be verified but the Saky airbase is home to Su-30M fighters, Su-24 bombers and the Il-76 transporter, used regularly to launch missile strikes into Ukraine and patrol the Black Sea and surrounding area. Ukraine’s public coyness about the attack is partly designed to preserve some ambiguity about the means used, sources said, prompting broad speculation as to how Kyiv was able to strike so deep behind Russian lines, in one of the first attacks on Crimean soil since the Russian invasion began in February. Justin Bronk, an aviation analyst with the Rusi thinktank, said that, having studied social media videos of the incident, he could see no evidence of incoming missiles and that he was “almost certain” there were “secondary explosions” of ammunition stores or fuel bunkers which were stored on or near the airstrip. That led him to conclude that “the most likely current theory for me is that Ukrainian special forces carried out the attack by infiltrating close enough to the base to launch and guide in small UAVs [drones] or loitering munitions, to hit either parked aircraft or fuel trucks/storage”. Other remarks and videos suggest the damage caused was considerable. Sergey Aksyonov, the Russian-appointed head of occupied Crimea, said that 13 had been wounded, 252 people had been rehoused and 62 apartment blocks had been damaged. A day earlier he had said one person had been killed. A social media video, geolocated to a car park near the base, showed several cars burnt out or damaged with their windows blown out, apparently from the ferocity of the blasts. Another brief video shows a destroyed jet on the tarmac, although it could not be verified. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told the BBC the UK was still trying to establish facts on the airbase explosions, but added that he believed it was unlikely western weapons were involved. The airbase, he argued, was a legitimate target for Ukraine’s armed forces. Ukrainian officials have also privately briefed that the attack was carried out with homegrown weapons. One political source said that Kyiv was keen to avoid using only US-made weapons to strike in the rear, because it is otherwise feared it could prompt the narrative that the US is effectively fighting a proxy war, which the Russians could exploit. On Tuesday, speculation had centred around whether the airbase had been struck by long range missiles, such as Ukraine’s home manufactured Neptune anti-ship missiles, modified to attack ground targets, from the area around Odesa, about 165 miles (265km) away. But there have been other hints that the attack could have been a daring raid, targeting munitions or fuel. Mikhail Polodyak, a key adviser to president Zelenskiy speculated in a TV interview on Tuesday along those lines, in which he also denied Ukrainian responsibility for the attack. “Could it be someone from the partisan movement that is gaining momentum? Of course, because the people who lived in the occupation [of Crimea] understand that the time of the occupation is ending and you need to show your position,” the adviser told the Dozhd TV channel. The attack on the airbase has been a morale boost for Kyiv, which is seeking to demonstrate it can mount a counter-offensive in the south of the country and retake the occupied city of Kherson before autumn sets in. Overnight, Zelenskiy talked about Crimea, but did not mention the attack on the airbase directly. “There will be no stable and lasting peace in many countries on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea as long as Russia is able to use our peninsula as its military base,” the president said. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukraine said 13 people were killed in overnight shelling near Nikopol, across the river Dnipro from the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant at Enerhodar. Ukraine said the attackers were hiding on the site of the power plant, preventing them from being counterattacked. G7 foreign ministers warned in a joint statement that Russia risked “the safety and security” of the site and called on Moscow to allow safety inspectors to immediately visit from the International Atomic Energy Agency – and to hand back the nuclear plant back to Ukraine. Russia, in turn, said it had requested that the issue be discussed by the UN security council on Thursday, after what it said were, “strikes by Kyiv” on the facility – the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Petro Kotin, the president of Energoatom – the Ukrainian company that owns the plant – said that Russia was trying to switch the plant over to supply Crimea with electricity, instead of Ukraine, which he described as risky. “To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system,” he said. “At the moment, the plant is operating with only one production line, which is an extremely dangerous way of working.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-sustains-losses-in-southern-ukraine-biden-doesnt-think-putin-will-use-nuclear-weapons","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-12T18:00:06Z","webTitle":"Russian nuclear strike would trigger a ‘physical response’ by Nato, says official – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-sustains-losses-in-southern-ukraine-biden-doesnt-think-putin-will-use-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-sustains-losses-in-southern-ukraine-biden-doesnt-think-putin-will-use-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"headline":"Russian nuclear strike would trigger a ‘physical response’ by Nato, says official – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv and Moscow. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s army boasted of territorial gains near the strategically vital southern city of Kherson on Wednesday. Five settlements in the Beryslav district in the north-east of the Kherson region – Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone – were said to have been taken from Russian forces over the day. Nato allies delivered new air defence systems in the wake of Russia’s recent missile attacks across the country. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of sophisticated National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (Nasams) from the US. A Russian nuclear strike would “almost certainly” trigger a “physical response” from Ukraine’s allies and potentially from Nato, a senior NATO official has said. Any use of nuclear weapons by Moscow would have “unprecedented consequences” for Russia, the official was quoted by Reuters as saying. At least seven people were killed and eight injured in a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region said. “There is no military logic in such shelling - only an unbridled desire to kill as many of our people as possible and intimidate others,” Pavlo Kyrylenko said. President Vladimir Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, Putin said in an address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas. There is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity, Alexei Miller said, adding that gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has appealed to citizens and businesses to reduce their electricity consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. People are being asked to reduce power consumption from 5pm to 10pm across Ukraine by 25% in order to stabilise the power system, which had been damaged by Russian missile attacks. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi had warned earlier that the loss of off-site power at the facility, Europe’s largest, was “deeply worrying”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the ZNPP, has accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators after shelling of a substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region caused the plant to lose power. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them. A senior Ukrainian official dismissed the investigation as “nonsense”. A crowdfunding appeal that was launched after Russian attacks on cities across the country on Monday has raised $9.6m (£8.7m) in 24 hours for the purchase of kamikaze drones for the Ukrainian armed forces. An initial 50 Ram II drones, unmanned aerial vehicles with a 3kg explosive payload, designed and built by Ukrainian companies, will be bought with the money, along with three control stations. President Putin will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in what is likely to be a “very interesting” meeting in Kazakhstan tomorrow, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. The Russian and Turkish presidents are expected to meet in Kazakhstan’s capital tomorrow on the sidelines of a regional summit. President Joe Biden has said he believes Vladimir Putin is a “rational actor” who badly misjudged his prospects of occupying Ukraine. The US president told CNN on Tuesday that he believed his Russian counterpart had underestimated the ferocity of Ukrainian defiance in the face of invasion, but does not believe he would resort to using a tactical nuclear weapon. Ukraine’s ministry of reintegration has confirmed that 37 Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia have now returned home. The children had been deported from the Russian-occupied territory of Kharkiv region in August, it said in a statement on Facebook. The Kremlin has denied a report that Elon Musk spoke with President Vladimir Putin before publishing his “peace plan” for Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. In a mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Ian Bremmer said the Tesla CEO had told him that Putin was “prepared to negotiate”. Musk has also denied the report. A Russian nuclear strike would “almost certainly” trigger a “physical response” from Ukraine’s allies and potentially from Nato, a senior NATO official has said. Any use of nuclear weapons by Moscow would have “unprecedented consequences” for Russia, the official was quoted by Reuters as saying. It would “almost certainly be drawing a physical response from many allies, and potentially from Nato itself,” the official said. The official added that Moscow was using its nuclear threats mainly to deter the alliance and other countries from directly entering its war on Ukraine. Ukraine’s army boasted of territorial gains near the strategically vital southern city of Kherson on Wednesday as Nato allies delivered new air defence systems in the wake of Russia’s recent missile attacks across the country. After 48 hours of Ukrainian cities coming under heavy fire, the government in Kyiv could celebrate positive news from both the frontlines and its diplomatic efforts to secure ground-to-air systems. Five settlements in the Beryslav district in the north-east of the Kherson region – Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone – were said to have been taken from Russian forces over the day. Kherson was the first city to fall to Russia following the invasion on 24 February and it is a crucial strategic and symbolic target for Ukraine’s southern counterattack. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of sophisticated National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (Nasams) from the US. “A new era of air defence has begun in Ukraine,” Reznikov tweeted. Iris-Ts from Germany are already here. Nasams are coming. This is only the beginning. And we need more.” Read the full story here: Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand, has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine, which includes ammunition, communications equipment, winter clothing, armoured vehicles and artillery. Some $15m (£9.8m) in winter clothing and $15.2m (£9.9m) in howitzer ammunition make up the bulk of the latest military assistance package, Anand announced as she sat down with her Nato counterparts in Brussels. Canada also will provide another $15.3m (£10m) worth of the high-tech cameras the Ukrainians have been using on their drones, along with more satellite communication services. More than 50 countries gathered for a meeting at Nato headquarters to promise more weapons, including air defences, for Ukraine after Russia launched its most intense missile strikes across the country since the war began. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, opened the gathering by condemning the Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s, deadly missile attacks against “targets with no military purpose”. Sitting beside his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, Austin said: The whole world has just seen yet again the malice and cruelty of Putin’s war of choice, rooted in aggression and waged with deep contempt for the rules of war. But Russia’s latest assaults have only deepened the determination of the Ukrainian people and further united countries of goodwill from every region on Earth. More than 90,000 Russian fighters have been listed as “irrecoverable” military losses since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the Russian media project iStories. “Irrecoverable losses” is a category that includes servicemen who were killed, went missing, died from their wounds or were disabled and cannot return to military service. The figure is close to US and UK estimates. In August, Britain’s defence minister, Ben Wallace, said the Russian army’s total losses, including deaths, injuries, and desertions, exceeded 80,000. Here’s more from Gazprom’s chief, Alexei Miller, who has warned that “whole towns” in Europe could freeze this winter despite the continent having almost filled its gas storage facilities. Speaking at the Russia Energy Week conference in Moscow earlier this afternoon, Miller said: Winter can be relatively warm, but one week or even five days will be abnormally cold and it’s possible that whole towns and lands, god forbid, will freeze. During days of peak winter demand, Europe could lack some 800m cubic metres of natural gas per day, or one third of its total consumption, Miller said. European gas inventories are currently about 91% full, with the most pessimistic estimates suggesting they will be at 5% capacity in March, he added. US president Joe Biden has said he has not seen any movement from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on the release of the American basketball star Brittney Griner. Griner, a two-time Olympic basketball gold medalist, was sentenced to nine years in prison in August after Russian police said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage at Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow in February. On Monday, Griner’s defence team appealed against her conviction for narcotics possession and trafficking. The US has said she was wrongfully detained and has offered to exchange her for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year prison sentence in America. Asked if he had seen any action on Griner’s case, Biden replied: Not from Putin. During his interview with CNN on Tuesday, Biden said he would be willing to meet Putin at the G20 meeting next month if the Russian leader wanted to discuss the detained WNBA star. He said: I have no intention of meeting with him. But for example, if he came to me at the G20 and said I want to talk about the release of Griner, I’d meet with him. I mean, it would depend. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has tweeted a photo of himself returning to Kyiv after meeting with President Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg yesterday. At Tuesday’s meeting shown on Russian state television, Putin told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief that the situation around Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was “of concern”. The Russian leader also told Grossi that Moscow was open for dialogue and would discuss “all issues” concerning the facility’s operations. Russian authorities are mobilising men from the country’s most vulnerable groups to fight in Ukraine, according to a report. Officials in Moscow have taken men from charity centres for the homeless and needy, as well as hostels where labour migrants live, the Moscow Times has cited a report by the independent Mediazona news website. Dozens of homeless men have been taken off the streets and brought to military enlistment offices in the weeks since President Vladimir Putin declared a “partial” mobilisation, according to a group that hands out food to the capital’s homeless community. One source told Mediazona: The police come here without anyone asking. They see a queue of people waiting for food — and then they grab them by the scruff of the neck, against their will. The men are then loaded onto buses and transported to military enlistment offices, the source said. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has appealed to citizens and businesses to reduce their electricity consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. People are being asked to reduce power consumption from 5pm to 10pm across Ukraine by 25% in order to stabilise the power system, which had been damaged by Russian missile attacks. In a statement, Shmyhal said: We are grateful to all Ukrainians who deliberately reduced electricity consumption yesterday and the night before yesterday. The total saving was 10%. We also thank the heads of regions, heads of communities, who took a responsible approach and cut power consumption in communities. He also appealed to people to use gas and coal sparingly after turning on the heating: The minimum permissible indoor temperature this winter will be 16 degrees Celsius, while the average temperature will be 18 degrees. This is a necessity and this is our contribution to the victory. After all, it depends on each of us how we will get through this winter.” It’s 6pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: At least seven people were killed and eight injured in a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region said. “There is no military logic in such shelling - only an unbridled desire to kill as many of our people as possible and intimidate others,” Pavlo Kyrylenko said. President Vladimir Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, Putin said in an address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas. There is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity, Alexei Miller said, adding that gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi had warned earlier that the loss of off-site power at the facility, Europe’s largest, was “deeply worrying”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the ZNPP, has accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators after shelling of a substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region caused the plant to lose power. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them. A senior Ukrainian official dismissed the investigation as “nonsense”. A crowdfunding appeal that was launched after Russian attacks on cities across the country on Monday has raised $9.6m (£8.7m) in 24 hours for the purchase of kamikaze drones for the Ukrainian armed forces. An initial 50 Ram II drones, unmanned aerial vehicles with a 3kg explosive payload, designed and built by Ukrainian companies, will be bought with the money, along with three control stations. Pope Francis condemned Russia’s “relentless bombings” of Ukrainian cities and appealed to “those who have the fate of the war in their hands” to stop. The Vatican’s number two, secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said the bombing of unarmed civilians “is beyond any logic. It is to be totally condemned”. President Putin will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in what is likely to be a “very interesting” meeting in Kazakhstan tomorrow, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. The Russian and Turkish presidents are expected to meet in Kazakhstan’s capital tomorrow on the sidelines of a regional summit. President Joe Biden has said he believes Vladimir Putin is a “rational actor” who badly misjudged his prospects of occupying Ukraine. The US president told CNN on Tuesday that he believed his Russian counterpart had underestimated the ferocity of Ukrainian defiance in the face of invasion, but does not believe he would resort to using a tactical nuclear weapon. Ukraine’s ministry of reintegration has confirmed that 37 Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia have now returned home. The children had been deported from the Russian-occupied territory of Kharkiv region in August, it said in a statement on Facebook. The Kremlin has denied a report that Elon Musk spoke with President Vladimir Putin before publishing his “peace plan” for Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. In a mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Ian Bremmer said the Tesla CEO had told him that Putin was “prepared to negotiate”. Musk has also denied the report. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today with all the latest from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Russia has depleted a significant proportion of its precision-guided ammunition in its invasion of Ukraine, according to a senior Nato official. Reuters quotes the official as saying that Moscow’s industry cannot produce all kinds of ammunition and weapon systems due to western sanctions. President Vladimir Putin will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in what is likely to be a “very interesting” meeting in Kazakhstan tomorrow, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. Speaking to reporters, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said: Now many say that the Turks are ready to come up with other initiatives in the context of the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict. There are reports in the press that the Turkish side is putting forward specific considerations in this regard, I do not exclude that Erdoğan will actively touch on this topic during the Astana contact. So a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us. The Russian and Turkish presidents are expected to meet in Kazakhstan’s capital tomorrow on the sidelines of a regional summit. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has previously said the potential talks between Russia and the west could be discussed during the meeting. The Netherlands will deliver €15m worth of air defence missiles to Ukraine in reaction to Russian air raids on Ukraine earlier this week. Reuters reports the the defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, wrote in a letter to parliament: “These attacks ... can only be met with unrelenting support for Ukraine and its people.” Earlier we reported that Pope Francis had condemned the recent wave of attacks on Ukrainian cities, saying: “My heart is always with the Ukrainian people, especially the residents of the places that have been hit by relentless bombings. May the Lord’s spirit transform the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that the hurricane of violence stops and peaceful coexistence in justice can be rebuilt.” Reuters has now reported an additional quote from the Vatican number two, secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin. Asked if the attacks could be considered war crimes, he said he was not qualified to make such a technical, juridical judgment. “But certainly they are unacceptable acts that cry out vengeance before God and before humanity, because bombing unarmed civilians is beyond any logic. It is to be totally condemned,” Parolin said. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the aftermath of Russian attacks on central Kyiv earlier this week. Power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is surrounded by Russian troops, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi, director general of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, had warned earlier today that the nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, had lost all external power needed for vital safety systems for the second time in five days. Grossi has now tweeted that he has been informed by his team that the external power to the facility has been restored: Earlier today, Grossi, who met yesterday with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said IAEA monitors at the Zaporizhzhia plant reported the interruption in external power, and said backup diesel generators were keeping nuclear safety and security equipment operational. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas, saying there is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity. Speaking at the Russia Energy Week conference in Moscow, Alexei Miller said gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months. Miller also said repairs to the damaged Nord Stream pipelines would take at least a year, and that Russia had still not been granted access to the area of damage. Germany and the EU “should respond” if they are interested in restoring the pipeline, he said. Simon Smith, a former British ambassador to Ukraine, writes for us today about how Russian missile strikes on Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine over the past two days stem from Vladimir Putin’s desperation. In their vicious efforts to extinguish Ukraine, the Russians have reached an unprecedented state of weakness and cluelessness, he writes. Putin is signalling that he is paying no heed to any waning commitment to the war among the population at large, following his mobilisation decision. And that he’s listening more closely to those who have been vocally critical of the army’s poor performance, and who have called for a tougher, (even) more ruthless offensive approach. But it goes further than that. It’s also an intimidatory message to Russian citizens opposed to his needless war – or even those simply less convinced of its good sense or justice. Read the full piece here: Mykhailo Podolyak, a presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on the west to officially recognise Russia’s aggression and acts in Ukraine as genocide. Russian forces have committed attacks on civilian infrastructure, mass executions and rape, forced deportations, separated families and destroyed Ukrainian literature in schools, Podolyak said on Twitter. Here’s more from President Vladimir Putin’s address to the Russian Energy Week international forum earlier today, where he proposed that Moscow could redirect gas supplies for the Nord Stream pipelines to the Black Sea to create a major European gas hub in Turkey. Putin said it was possible to repair the damaged pipelines but that Russia and Europe should decide their fate. He said: We could move the lost volumes along the Nord Streams along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea region and thus make the main routes for the supply of our fuel, our natural gas to Europe through Turkey, creating the largest gas hub for Europe in Turkey. He added: That is, of course, if our partners are interested in this. And economic feasibility, of course. The Kremlin has denied a report that Elon Musk spoke with President Vladimir Putin before publishing his “peace plan” for Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. In a mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Ian Bremmer said the Tesla CEO had told him that Putin was “prepared to negotiate”. Musk has since denied the report. Asked if Musk had spoken to Putin prior to publishing the Twitter poll, the Kremlin’s spokesperson said: No, this is not true. The pair had communicated over the phone “about a year and a half ago”, Peskov added without providing any details. In a reply to a tweet, Musk said he had spoken to the Russian leader “only once and that was about 18 months ago”. The subject matter of that conversation was “space”, he added. Bremmer subsequently reiterated his initial claims, and said Musk had told him he had spoken with Putin “directly about Ukraine”. We reported yesterday that children’s doctor Oksana Leontieva was among those killed by Russian missile strikes on Kyiv earlier this week. Leontieva was on her way to work on Monday morning after dropping her son at kindergarten when a Russian missile hit the Ukrainian capital. Now her father, Gregory, has told German newspaper Bild that her death has left her five-year-old son an orphan after his father recently died as well. He added: Oksana had called the hospital in the morning because the kindergarten couldn’t take her son due to warnings of a possible attack. In the end, they did take Grischa ... and she went to work. Gregory said the boy had not yet been told his mother had died. Gregory said: For now he thinks she is at work and working very hard. We will tell him today or tomorrow. The doctor’s funeral is due to be held later this week. The number of people wounded after a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka in Ukraine’s Donetsk region has risen to nine, according to a city official. At least seven people were killed after the Russian shelling on the market this morning, Vitalii Barabash, the head of the Avdiivka city military administration, said. In a statement on Telegram, Barabash said: Today is another black day for our Avdiivka. In the morning, the Russian evil spirits once again brought death to our land, sneakily, as always, shelling the central market with tanks and MLR systems during rush hour. Seven residents of Avdiivka were killed and nine were wounded. The European Commission wants at least €18bn (£15.8bn) in emergency aid to help Ukraine’s government stay afloat next year, as an economic crisis looms in the country. Officials in Brussels think the EU should provide at least half the €3bn-€3.5bn monthly running costs it estimates the Ukrainian state needs to function in 2023, the Guardian has learned. The financial aid would most likely be in the form of cheap loans with long repayment deadlines. But it would require EU member states to find extra money to guarantee the loans and potentially pay the interest. According to the World Bank, Ukraine’s economy is on course to shrink by more than one third (35%) in 2022, as a result of the widespread destruction of factories, infrastructure, fertile land, as well as the displacement of 14 million people. EU sources fear that if Ukraine cannot afford to pay its bills it could print money, triggering inflation. EU officials are optimistic about an agreement on the new financial aid, despite long delays in releasing €9bn funding for Ukraine promised in May. Nearly five months since the commission proposed €9bn in “macro financial assistance” for Ukraine, only €1bn has been released. Earlier this month, Brussels and Kyiv signed an agreement on the next €5bn, paving the way for a €2bn tranche to be released this month. EU member states have been wrangling over whether aid to Ukraine should be offered as non-repayable grants, as favoured by Germany, or cheap loans, the option backed by most member states. The money would allow the Ukrainian government to pay salaries, fund humanitarian relief and make emergency repairs to some essential infrastructure. But it falls far short of the vast costs of rebuilding Ukraine, estimated by the World Bank to be $349bn (€359bn, £315bn). President Vladimir Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational, in his address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The Russian leader said gas could still be supplied by one remaining intact part of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, he said. Putin says: Russia is ready to start such supplies. The ball is in the court of the EU. If they want, they can just open the tap. He went on to say that Russia has nothing to do with the sky-high energy prices that Europeans are facing this winter, instead blaming the west for stoking a global energy crisis. It was the poorest countries that would pay the highest price in terms of rising energy costs, Putin added. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is currently addressing the Russian Energy Week international forum’s plenary session. Large leaks that suddenly erupted in the Nord Stream gas pipelines running from Russia to Europe were an “act of international terrorism” that set a “dangerous precedent”. Putin says: There is no doubt it was an act of international terrorism, aiming to undermine the energy security of a whole continent. The calculation behind it was quite cynical, to block and destroy the cheap energy sources and deprive millions of people and industrial consumers of gas, heat, power and other resources. The “attack” against the Nord Stream pipelines was a “most dangerous precedent”, he continued: It shows that any piece of critical transport energy or communications infrastructure is at risk now. Putin goes on to blame Ukrainian special services for what he calls the “terrorist attack” against the Kerch bridge connecting Russia to Crimea. At least seven people were killed and eight injured in a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region said. In a statement, Pavlo Kyrylenko said: The Russians struck the central market where many people were at that time. He added: There is no military logic in such shelling - only an unbridled desire to kill as many of our people as possible and intimidate others. More to follow. Ukraine’s ministry of reintegration has confirmed that 37 Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia have now returned home. The children had been deported from the Russian-occupied territory of Kharkiv region in August, it said in a statement on Facebook. The statement reads: At the end of August, the little ones were forcibly taken out of Kharkiv region to the Russian township of Kabardinka (near Gelendzhik), despite the fact that everyone has parents. The families had been reunited, it said. The ministry described the return process as difficult but successful. A crowdfunding appeal that was launched after Russian attacks on cities across the country on Monday has raised $9.6m (£8.7m) in 24 hours for the purchase of kamikaze drones for the Ukrainian armed forces. An initial 50 Ram II drones, unmanned aerial vehicles with a 3kg explosive payload, designed and built by Ukrainian companies, will be bought with the money, along with three control stations. Further munitions would be secured over the coming days, said Serhiy Prytula, who organised the initiative. He said: “They wanted to scare us but we united even more. Remember: never infuriate Ukrainians. Never. The people have donated for the revenge, so we will ensure the revenge happens.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told G7 leaders on Tuesday via video conference that Russia had used a variety of munitions to strike Ukrainian cities over the previous two days, killing 20 people. “The enemy has used more than 100 cruise missiles, dozens of different drones, including Iranian Shaheds,” he said. “And every 10 minutes I receive a message about the enemy’s use of Iranian Shaheds.” Read the full story here: The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said rhetoric from western leaders on the potential use of nuclear weapons was “provocative”. Speaking to reporters during his regular briefing, Peskov said: We express our daily regret that Western heads of state – the US as well as European – engage in nuclear rhetoric every day. We consider this a pernicious and provocative practice. Russia does not want to take part in these exercises and does not take part in them. Leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) countries yesterday warned of “severe consequences” if Russia decided to use nuclear weapons, in a statement after a call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The US president, Joe Biden, warned that threats from Russia could result in catastrophic “mistakes” and “miscalculation”, a week after he said the risk of “nuclear Armageddon” was at its highest level in 60 years. Peskov added that there had been no attempt from either Washington or Moscow to discuss a potential meeting between Biden and President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin also denied reports from some regional officials that they were stepping up mobilisation efforts. “There is no new wave,” Peskov said, telling reporters to check with individual governors to see what they meant. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them. A statement from the Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed “the organiser of the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge was the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, its head Kyrylo Budanov, employees and agents. Currently, five citizens of Russia, three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia, who participated in the preparation of the crime, have been detained within the framework of the criminal case.” A senior Ukrainian official dismissed the investigation as “nonsense”. “The whole activity of the FSB and Investigative Committee is nonsense,” Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne cited interior minister spokesman Andriy Yusov as saying. He described the FSB and Investigative Committee as “fake structures that serve the Putin regime, so we will definitely not comment on their next statements”. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has described developments at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which has lost off-site power, as “deeply worrying”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators after shelling of a substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region caused the plant to lose power. Pope Francis on Wednesday condemned Russia’s “relentless bombings” of Ukrainian cities and appealed to “those who have the fate of the war in their hands” to stop. He was quoted as saying “My heart is always turned to the people of Ukraine, especially those living in places hit by the bombing”. The pontiff prayed for an intercession that “may change the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that they may cease this wave of violence and rebuild peaceful coexistence”. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is a “rational actor who has miscalculated significantly,” US president Joe Biden said in a clip of a CNN interview broadcast late on Tuesday. Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range airstrikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The leaders of the G7 on Tuesday condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks on cities across Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms” and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border. Roughly 30% of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been hit by Russia since Monday, officials said. As millions in Ukraine are facing blackouts due to the attacks, the government has urged civilians to cut their electricity use and not use domestic appliances such as ovens and washing machines. That is it from me Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly. Russia’s security forces have released what they claim is an X-ray image of the cargo that caused the explosion at the weekend on the Crimea bridge. The veracity of the image, and its source, has not been independently verified. It has been issued as part of their investigation which has led to the arrest of eight individuals today [see 7.13am]. Russia has claimed the plan was masterminded by Ukrainian officials, a suggestion which has been dismissed as “nonsense” by Ukraine’s interior minister spokesperson, Andriy Yusov [see 9.08am]. Russia’s Dmitry Peskov has said that comments made by Nato General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg could be considered confirmation that Nato is fighting on Ukraine’s side in Kyiv’s conflict with Russia. Reuters remind us that yesterday Stoltenberg said that a Russian victory in Ukraine would be “a defeat for us all” During his regular morning media briefing, the Kremlin spokesperson also said rhetoric from western leaders on the potential use of nuclear weapons was harmful and provocative. “We express our daily regret that western heads of state engage in nuclear rhetoric every day,” Peskov said, adding that such a practice was “provocative”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators. It has been cut off from off-site power. In a statement posted to Telegram, Energoatom said: This morning, 12 October at 8.59am, as a result of rocket fire by Russian troops, the Dniprovska substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region was damaged. As a result, the 750-kV communication line of ZANP – Dniprovska was accidentally opened. As a result, the ZNPP was completely de-energized. Diesel generators turned on automatically. Energoatom prepared and sent another batch of diesel fuel to the ZNPP. However, as of 10am, the Russian side does not allow the company’s convoy of vehicles to pass. Russian shelling and damage to energy infrastructure related to the operation of nuclear power plants is the same manifestation of nuclear terrorism as direct shelling of the ZNPP, and leads to the same consequences and threats of a radiation accident. The occupiers continue to neglect the nuclear and radiation safety of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, threatening the world with a radiation disaster. The claims have not been independently verified. Both sides have previously accused the other of shelling the ZNPP directly, which sits in one of the occupied regions that Russia has claimed to “annex”. Pope Francis condemned Russia’s “relentless bombings” of Ukrainian cities and appealed to “those who have the fate of the war in their hands” to stop. He was quoted as saying “My heart is always turned to the people of Ukraine, especially those living in places hit by the bombing.” The pontiff prayed for an intercession that “may change the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that they may cease this wave of violence and rebuild peaceful coexistence”. A senior Ukrainian official dismissed as “nonsense” on Wednesday Russia’s investigation into an explosion last weekend that badly damaged a bridge linking the Russian mainland to the Crimea peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has blamed Ukraine’s security forces for the explosion, and earlier today Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said it had detained five Russians and three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia over the blast. “The whole activity of the FSB and Investigative Committee is nonsense,” Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne cited the interior minister spokesperson, Andriy Yusov, as saying when asked about Moscow’s allegations on the Crimea Bridge blast. Reuters reports Yusov described the FSB and Investigative Committee as “fake structures that serve the Putin regime, so we will definitely not comment on their next statements”. RIA Novosti, the Russian state-owned news agency, has a breaking news story quoting Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed leader of occupied Zaporizhzhia, saying that a nuclear safety zone cannot be established around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant “until the frontline is pushed at least 100km, otherwise it is unsafe”. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has described developments at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which has lost off-site power, as “deeply worrying”. Rafael Grossi tweeted: Our team at the ZNPP informed me this morning that the plant has lost all of its external power for the second time in five days. Its back-up diesel generators are now providing electricity for its nuclear safety and security functions. This repeated loss of the ZNPP’s off-site power is a deeply worrying development and it underlines the urgent need for a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the site. The ZNPP has been occupied by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff since early in Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine. Russia has claimed to have “annexed” Zaporizhzhia, and stated it intends to take the plant under its own operational framework. You can understand there being jitters about Europe’s power infrastructure after the Nord Stream pipeline incident, but Poland’s top official in charge of energy infrastructure, Mateusz Berger, has told Reuters by telephone that there are no grounds to believe the leak in the Polish section of the Druzhba oil pipeline was caused by sabotage. “Here we can talk about accidental damage,” he said. Reuters is carrying a report, citing the Russian Interfax news agency, that Russia’s Transneft state-owned pipeline monopoly said on Wednesday it had received notice from Polish operator Pern about a leak on the Druzhba oil pipeline. Transneft stated that oil continues to be pumped towards Poland, and that Pern had not yet said how long repairs would take. The pipeline was built by the Soviet Union in the 1960s to pump oil from eastern regions of Russia into the satellite states of the Soviet bloc, and it now carries oil to points in Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany. Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of Sumy, has posted to Telegram to say that “the night was quiet” in his region, but that in the morning Russians resumed shelling at the border. As of 10am local time he had no information on casualties. Ukrainian MP Lisa Yasko has been interviewed from Strasbourg by Sky News in the UK, and has said that delays in delivering assistance to Ukraine were “incredibly frustrating”, and that she felt little comfort from suggestions that there were no signs Russia was about to deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine. She told viewers: I know that sometimes, some western countries, they’re just far and they don’t feel the urgency, which is incredibly frustrating for us. Because you know, we don’t have time for discussion. So we are screaming, we are trying to to do everything possible to defend with our weapons, our people, every second. Asked about the head of British GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, talking down the prospect of the use of nuclear weapons, she said: I don’t think it can offer me a comfort, because the threat of nuclear war is very, very high. We understand that Putin doesn’t have any logic anymore. It’s not possible to justify Putin anymore. We understand that he is in the final battle of his life, where he wants to prove to all the world that he can do whatever he wants, including taking lands, killing thousands of people, destroying infrastructure, and we understand that nuclear threats and a strike is very possible. Yesterday Fleming said “I would hope that we would see indicators if they started to go down that path,” and suggested that “The way in which the Russian military machine and President Putin are conducting this war, they are staying within the doctrine that we understand for their use, including for nuclear weapons.” Here is a video clip from Joe Biden’s CNN TV interview, where he says that he believed his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had underestimated the ferocity of Ukrainian defiance in the face of invasion. ‘I think … he thought he was going to be welcomed with open arms, that this was the home of Mother Russia in Kyiv, and that he was going to be welcomed, and I think he just totally miscalculated,’ Biden said. Russia’s state-owned news agency RIA Novosti is carrying some more details of the plot to damage the Crimea bridge which Russian security forces claim to have revealed today. It reports: In early August, the cargo was sent from the seaport of Odesa to the Bulgarian Ruse [port] … From Bulgaria it proceeded to the Georgian port of Poti , and then to Armenia. From 29 September to 3 October, at the Transalliance terminal in Yerevan, the cargo was cleared … On a DAF truck registered in Georgia, the cargo crossed the Russian-Georgian border on 4 October at the Upper Lars checkpoint, two days later it was delivered and unloaded at a wholesale base in Armavir. On 7 October … the documents for the cargo were again changed. TEK-34 LLC from Ulyanovsk was indicated as the sender , and a non-existent company in the Crimea was indicated as the recipient. The movement of cargo along the entire route was controlled by an employee of the main intelligence directorate of the ministry of defence of Ukraine, who introduced himself to the participants in the scheme as “Ivan Ivanovich”. To coordinate actions, he used a virtual anonymous number, as well as a phone registered to a resident of Kremenchug. RIA reminds us that the explosion occurred on 8 October, and that the official account is “a truck exploded on the Crimean bridge after which seven tanks with fuel of a passing train caught fire. Two car spans partially collapsed, but the bridge arch supports were not damaged. Four people were killed, including a judge from Moscow.” Polish pipeline operator Pern detected a leak on Tuesday evening in one line of the Druzhba pipeline, which carries oil from Russia to Europe, it said on Wednesday. Pern said at this point the causes of the leak are unknown. It was detected in a section of the pipe around 70km from the central Polish city of Plock. The second line of the pipeline, and other elements of Pern’s infrastructure, were working as normal, Pern said. “At this point, all Pern services (technical, operational, in-house fire brigade and environmental protection) are taking action in accordance with the algorithms provided for this type of situation,” Reuters reports the operator said. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has claimed that five people were injured and 17 houses were damaged by fire from Ukrainian forces in the last 24 hours. Donetsk is one of the occupied regions that Russia has claimed to annex. The Donetsk People’s Republic was declared in 2014, and Russia, Syria and North Korea are the only UN member states to recognise it as a legitimate authority. The claims have not been independently verified. Serhai Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has posted an update on Telegram on Ukraine’s military progress in the occupied Luhansk region. He writes: The armed forces of Ukraine are moving forward little by little. The Russians are shelling our positions mainly with rocket and barrel artillery. The occupiers are building a multi-layer defence line in Luhansk region, the entire first section of the front line is mined by them. Our military has already encountered the first wave of partially mobilised Russians. Luhansk is one of the region of occupied Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex following a widely-derided “referendum”. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them, according to reports from the state-owned Tass news agency. It quotes a statement from the Federal Security Service (FSB) saying: The Federal Security Service, together with the Investigative Committee, established that the organiser of the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge was the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, its head Kyrylo Budanov, employees and agents. Currently, five citizens of Russia, three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia, who participated in the preparation of the crime, have been detained within the framework of the criminal case. The FSB claims that the explosives which caused a section of the bridge to collapse were sent from Odessa through Bulgaria, Georgia and Armenia. Tass reports that the cargo carrying the explosives was being sent to a non-existent company in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

Most have reportedly been refused entry. There has been an exodus of conscription-age men from Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered a partial mobilisation on 21 September, but most fled by road, rail and air to Europe, and neighbouring former Soviet Union countries, like Georgia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. On Tuesday, South Korean broadcaster KBS reported that at least 21 Russians had arrived aboard yachts at ports in the south of the country, but only two had been granted entry, while others were refused as authorities deemed their purpose “ambiguous”. KBS reported that three yachts had docked in the southeastern port city of Pohang over the past several days, mostly carrying Russian men in their 20-30s. An official at Pohang’s coast guard declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. A justice ministry official said he did not have details about the yacht cases, but Russians are in general allowed to enter the country without a visa as long as they obtain prior approval via South Korea’s electronic travel authorisation system. The UK Ministry of Defence has published its latest update on the situation in Ukraine, in which it reports that 60% of the “Shahed” drones launched by Russia on 10 October were destroyed in the air. The drones are manufactured in Iran. “These UAVs are slow and fly at low altitudes making lone aircraft easy to target using conventional air defences. There is a realistic possibility that Russia has achieved some success by attacking with several UAVs at the same time,” according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accepted an invitation to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bangkok next month, according to a report in the Bangkok Post, which cites an unnamed security source. Both the G20 and Apec summits will be held in Southeast Asia in November, with gatherings overshadowed by the war in Ukraine. Ministerial meetings held over the past year have been marred by confrontation and walkouts. Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden are reportedly expected to attend the G20 summit in Bali between 15 and 15th November, while Indonesia has also invited the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to attend. Apec will be held on 18 and 19 November. On Tuesday, Lavrov said that Putin would not turn down a meeting with Biden in Bali. Talking on Russian state TV, he said that Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate. He said US officials including the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, had said the US was willing to engage in discussions but Russia had refused. “This is a lie”, he added. Biden is not expected to be at Apec and will instead return home to attend his granddaughter’s wedding ceremony, according to Thai media. It is not known whether Xi will attend Apec. Would Lukashenko really throw Belarus into a war Russia is losing? Andrew Roth and Daniel Boffey tackle the question in a new analysis piece. Alexander Lukashenko, the dictatorial leader of Belarus, has executed a careful balancing act during the war in Ukraine. On 24 February, Russian troops that had massed on Belarusian territory surged across the border into Ukraine, using his country as a staging ground in the largest invasion in Europe since the second world war. But the Belarusian leader has not joined the war directly or sent his own troops into the fight, at times saying that he felt the invasion was “dragging on”. Now, meetings between Lukashenko and Vladimir Putin have once again raised fears he is about to enter the fray. Lukashenko has said that Belarus and Russia are to deploy a joint military group and that thousands of Russian troops will be arriving in his country in the coming days for drills. “We emphasise once again that the tasks of the regional force group are purely defensive. And all activities carried out at the moment are aimed at providing a sufficient response to actions near our borders,” the Belarusian defence minister, Viktor Khrenin, said in a statement on Tuesday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, sounded the alarm during a meeting of the G7 on Tuesday, proposing to send UN peacekeepers to the border between Ukraine and Belarus to prevent Lukashenko from launching a “provocation”. Despite the warning signs, there is considerable doubt that Lukashenko is ready to throw his own forces into a war that Russia is losing in Ukraine, even if he is under pressure from Putin. Energy exports appear to be helping Russia ride out Western sanctions, AFP reports. Moscow says inflation is easing and employment is virtually full, contradicting the predictions of a catastrophe from many financial experts. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday offered some support to Russia’s view, saying recession will be less severe than expected due to oil exports and relatively stable domestic demand. The IMF forecast the Russian economy to contract just 3.4% over the whole year, after contracting 21.8% during the second quarter at a quarterly annualised rate. It was only in June that the IMF forecast an annual drop of 6%. When US President Joe Biden was asked in a Tuesday evening interview on CNN whether he thinks Putin will use nuclear weapons, he said, “I don’t think he will.” Biden was speaking after warning last week that the world faced the most acute nuclear threat for 60 years –since the Cuban missile crisis. “The whole point I was making was it could lead to just a horrible outcome,” he told Tapper. “And not because anybody intends to turn it into a world war or anything, but just once you use a nuclear weapon, the mistakes that can be made, the miscalculations, who knows what would happen.” Russian troops have sustained equipment and personnel losses in Ukraine’s south, the Kyiv Independent reported, citing Ukraine’s Operational Command. “Ukraine’s Operational Command ‘South’ reported that they completed over 300 fire missions, targeting and damaging two Russian Gvozdika self-propelled howitzers and an APC,” the Kyiv Independent said in a tweet. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the latest developments for the next while. Russian troops have sustained losses in Ukraine’s south following 300 fire missions, Ukraine’s Operational Command reported overnight. Meanwhile, in an interview with CNN on Tuesday evening, US President Joe Biden said he doesn’t think Putin will use a tactical nuclear weapon. Biden was speaking after warning last week that the world faced the most acute nuclear threat for 60 years –since the Cuban missile crisis. We’ll have more on this shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments in the conflict: Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range airstrikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The leaders of the G7 condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks on cities across Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms” and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, described Russia’s attacks as “a profound change in the nature of this war”. During Russia’s strikes in recent days, cruise missiles and armed drones rained down on parks, playgrounds, power stations and other civilian targets. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is a “rational actor who has miscalculated significantly,” US president Joe Biden said in a clip of a CNN interview broadcast on Tuesday. Ukrainian authorities said on Tuesday they exhumed the bodies of dozens of people, including civilians and a one-year-old baby, to determine the cause of death after the retreat of Russian troops from Lyman and Sviatohirsk, two recently liberated towns in the eastern Donetsk region. Roughly 30% of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been hit by Russia since Monday, officials said. As millions in Ukraine are facing blackouts due to the attacks, the government has urged civilians to cut their electricity use and not use domestic appliances such as ovens and washing machines. The Kremlin has confirmed that Putin will meet Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday to discuss Ukraine. Moscow would not turn down a meeting between Putin and Biden at the G20 meeting next month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate, Lavrov said in an interview on Russian state television. Putin has told the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency that he is “open to dialogue” on the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Meanwhile the deputy head of the Zaporizhzhia power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. Valeriy Martynyuk was taken on Monday and is being detained in an unknown location, Energoatom said in a post on Telegram. Elon Musk denied a report that he spoke with Putin before tweeting a proposal to end the war in Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. Belarus’ defence ministry said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, it claimed. Russian strikes have damaged hundreds of cultural sites, Zelenskiy said as he urged the UN cultural agency to expel Russia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Unesco World Heritage Committee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/11/which-energy-firms-met-boris-johnson-and-how-big-are-their-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-11T15:54:07Z","webTitle":"Which energy firms met Boris Johnson – and how big are their profits?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/11/which-energy-firms-met-boris-johnson-and-how-big-are-their-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/11/which-energy-firms-met-boris-johnson-and-how-big-are-their-profits","fields":{"headline":"Which energy firms met Boris Johnson – and how big are their profits?","bodyText":"Boris Johnson met executives from some of Britain’s biggest energy companies on Thursday to discuss the cost of living crisis. Johnson was flanked by the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, and the business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. Zahawi said afterwards that the energy firms agreed to “do more to help the people who most need it” – but did not specify what that would entail. The executives were from power-generation companies – which own assets including windfarms and nuclear power stations – rather than the oil and gas companies hit by the windfall tax, officially known as the Energy Profits Levy, after raking in bumper profits caused in part by the war in Ukraine. However, there is a lingering threat that the levy may be extended to electricity generation companies amid accusations that they have also enjoyed a bonanza from high energy prices. Below are the companies that attended the meeting, along with their profits and executive pay packages. While all operate in the UK, many are headquartered abroad.

The ministry said it was the single largest shipment of produce to leave Ukraine since the country brokered an export deal with Russia, the UN and Turkey on 22 July. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has thanked Germany for its solidarity in the face of the Russian invasion and called for more weapons, in a sign of easing tensions between Berlin and Kyiv. He was welcomed by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, with military honours in Berlin. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pushed the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to prepare a fresh package of sanctions, including a ban on issuing visas to Russsian citizens. Humanitarian aid has been blocked from being delivered to the occupied city of Enerhodar, according to its mayor, Dymtro Orlov. He said that trucks with nappies, food and other essentials had been turned back for the second day in a row. Russian forces hit multiple residential targets in Mykolaiv overnight, according to its governor, Vitaliy Kim. He said homes were damaged, as well as three hospitals, two education facilities, a hotel and a museum. Pictures of the damage are coming through already. A video showing Russian multiple-launch rocket systems firing from the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been published by the Insider. The footage, taken overnight on Friday into early Saturday morning, shows the missile launchers close to a power unit. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmygal, is set to visit Germany on Sunday – the first high-level Ukrainian official to visit the country in months. The trip is a sign of eased tensions after a rocky patch between Kyiv and Berlin, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia is using “poverty and political chaos” to attack the lives of all Europeans. In his evening address late on Saturday, president Zelensky said that by stopping the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, Russia wanted to “destroy the normal life of every European.” Russian forces are suffering from “morale and discipline issues” in addition to combat fatigue and high casualties, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Troops’ main grievances probably continued to be around pay, including the high chance that “sizeable combat bonuses” were not being paid, the latest British intelligence update said. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and is relying on a reserve line, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Previously, there had been reports the plant in south-eastern Ukraine had been knocked offline in the early hours of Saturday amid sustained shelling that destroyed a key power line, according to local Russian-backed authorities. Sweden has said it would provide liquidity guarantees to Nordic and Baltic energy companies worth “billions of dollars” in an effort to prevent a financial crisis sparked by Europe’s energy crunch. The Russian energy company Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for them to carry out the work. The European Union expects Russia to respect existing energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so, the economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said. Our political correspondent, Peter Walker, has written about the main challenges facing Liz Truss if she becomes UK prime minister this week. Here’s what he has to say about her likely position on Ukraine: As Johnson’s foreign secretary, and the self-styled continuity-Boris candidate, Truss will maintain his steadfast support for Ukraine’s battle against Russian invaders. One of the few near certainties of Truss’s early weeks in office will be images of her in Kyiv alongside Volodymyr Zelenskiy. But in common with other world leaders, Truss will face difficulties as the war inches forward, with no apparent resolution in sight, especially once the consequences of the energy price crisis, much of it connected to the war, begin to bite. Truss will doubtless stay committed to Ukraine. But as its repercussions are felt, it seems likely she will face more voices, within the Conservative party and more widely, seeking an alternative plan. A fleet of 13 ships carrying more than 280,000 tonnes of grain and agricultural products left ports in Odesa on Sunday, according to Ukraine’s ministry of infrastructure. The ministry said it was the single largest shipment of produce to leave Ukraine since the country brokered an export deal with Russia, the UN and Turkey on 22 July. The grain initiative was signed to try and avert a global crisis and ensure the safe transport of wheat and other essential products, such as sunflower oil. The delivery from ports in Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdenny on Sunday will go to eight countries. So far, 86 ships have left Ukraine to export produce to 19 countries since 1 August, the ministry said. Jennifer Rankin has reported on the latest news from Berlin, where Ukraine’s prime minister has been meeting the German chancellor. Ukraine’s prime minister has thanked Germany for its solidarity in the face of the Russian invasion while calling for more weapons, in a sign of easing tensions between Berlin and Kyiv. Denys Shmyhal, who was welcomed by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, with military honours in Berlin later on Sunday, is the most senior Ukrainian official to visit the German capital in months, since Kyiv accused the EU’s biggest economy of doing too little. Starting his Berlin trip, Shmyhal met the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who was blocked from visiting Kyiv in April because of his past advocacy of strong German-Russian ties. Steinmeier, a former German foreign minister, who conceded in April that his approach to Moscow had been mistaken, offered to travel to Ukraine’s capital in the early weeks of the war to show solidarity but was told his visit was “not desired in Kyiv”. In a tweet after the meeting with Steinmeier, Shmyhal said they had discussed the military situation, strengthening sanctions and the need to provide weapons for Ukraine. “Thanked for solidarity with Ukrainians and support,” the tweet said. “Germany has made huge progress in its support of Ukraine with weapons,” Shmyhal told German media before his trip, according to Agence France-Presse. But the prime minister added that Kyiv needed more from Berlin, including “modern combat tanks” such as the Leopard 2. Humanitarian aid has been blocked from being delivered to the occupied city of Enerhodar, according to its mayor, Dymtro Orlov. Orlov said in a post on Telegram that trucks had been turned back for the second day in a row and that the Russians were doing “everything to block the city from the entire civilised world.” He said the consignment included nappies, hygiene kits and food for vulnerable families. He also posted an image of pallets that appeared to be stacked with nappies, energy biscuits and Unicef branded boxes. Orlov said the delivery also included more than 1,000 square metres of protective fabric for windows blasted out during shelling. He said “the main argument” at the first Russian checkpoint they came to was that “Enerhodar does not need anything, the local residents have everything and even more.” More evidence is emerging of civilian targets hit overnight by Russian missile strikes, this time in Kharkiv. Photographs from the Anadolu agency show the aftermath of a strike on a restaurant complex in the north-eastern city. Only the metal carcass of the building and its furniture remain – along with heaps of burnished cutlery which hint at its past use. AFP has the latest on a key meeting between the Ukrainian prime minister and the German president in Berlin today: Ukraine prime minister Denys Shmyhal brought Kyiv’s plea for more weapons to Germany on Sunday, saying his country needed additional help in its battle against Russia. Shmyhal is the first high-level Ukrainian official to visit Germany in months, in a sign of eased tensions between Kyiv and Berlin after a rocky patch. The first stop on his trip was a meeting with president Frank-Walter Steinmeier, where Shmyhal “discussed the military situation, strengthening sanctions and the need to provide weapons for Ukraine,” he said on Twitter. Shmyhal, who will meet chancellor Olaf Scholz later on Sunday, also thanked Germany “for solidarity with Ukrainians and support”. Germany will “continue to stand reliably by Ukraine’s side,” Steinmeier reassured Shmyhal, according to the German president’s spokeswoman. The Ukrainian prime minister’s visit marked a sharp change in tone, after a row erupted in April when Kyiv rebuffed Steinmeier’s offer to travel to Ukraine. Steinmeier, a former foreign minister from Scholz’s Social Democratic Party, had been shunned over his years-long detente policy towards Moscow - something which he has admitted was a mistake following the outbreak of war. It is 2.20pm in Kyiv and here is a summary of the day so far. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pushed the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to prepare a fresh package of sanctions, including a ban on issuing visas to Russian citizens. Russian forces have hit multiple residential targets in Mykolaiv overnight, according to its governor, Vitaliy Kim.

The European Union expects Russia to respect existing energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so, the economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said. Gazprom’s announcement that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 would not restart came after G7 finance ministers said they planned to implement a price cap on Russian oil to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pushed the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to prepare a fresh package of sanctions. The Ukrainian president has just tweeted that he spoke on the phone to her and discussed financial aid to his country as well as calling for any sanctions to include a ban on issuing visas to Russian citizens. Zelenskiy said they also coordinated steps to limit excessive Russian profit from sales of oil and gas. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Russia is using “poverty and political chaos” to attack the lives of all Europeans. In his evening address late on Saturday, president Zelensky said that by stopping the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, Russia wanted to “destroy the normal life of every European.” Russia’s state energy firm Gazprom said on Saturday that the pipeline could be closed indefinitely. Zelensky said: Russia is trying to increase the energy pressure on Europe even more – gas pumping through the Nord Stream pipeline has completely stopped. Why do they do this? Russia wants to destroy the normal life of every European – in all countries of our continent. It wants to weaken and intimidate the entire Europe, every state. Where Russia cannot do it by force of conventional weapons, it does so by force of energy weapons. It is trying to attack with poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles. And to protect against this, we all in Europe need even more unity, even more coordination, even more help to each other. This winter, Russia is preparing for a decisive energy attack on all Europeans. And the key answers to this should be two things: first, our unity – unity in protection against the terrorist state, and second – Increasing our own pressure on Russia – this includes increasing sanctions at all levels, and limiting Russia’s oil and gas revenues. Images are starting to come in of the damage done by Russian shelling overnight in Mykolaiv, in the south of Ukraine. Reuters photographer, Umit Bektas, has captured the moment medical staff returned to clear up the wreckage of a primary care centre and family clinic in Mykolaiv this morning. Russian forces have hit multiple residential targets in the south central part of Ukraine overnight, according to Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv. Posting on his Telegram account, he said that Russian shelling had damaged homes, three hospitals, two education facilities, a hotel and a museum in the area. Kim said the targets included a private house destroyed by a missile in the village of Vysunsk, Bereznehuvate, where one child is reported to have died and three others have shrapnel injuries. He said the city of Mykolaiv was subjected to “massive rocket fire” overnight from Saturday into this morning, with many municipal buildings damaged and one person reported as injured so far. A video showing Russian multiple-launch rocket systems firing from the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been published by the Insider. The footage, taken overnight on Friday into early Saturday morning, shows the missile launchers close to a power unit. It appears to confirm that Moscow is using the station for offensive military strikes across the Dnipro river, as has previously been alleged by Ukraine. An artist who painted a mural of a Russian and Ukrainian soldier embracing in Melbourne, Australia, has said he will remove it after a backlash. Peter Seaton said the three storey mural was intended as a message of peace but after outcry from Ukrainians, he pledged to paint over it by Monday, according to a report by WA Today Ukraine’s Ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, had said the work was “utterly offensive to all Ukrainians” and called for its removal. The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations’ Stefan Romaniw had compared the painting to a rapist hugging a victim. Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelensky, has just been speaking on the first episode of Laura Kuenssberg’s new Sunday show. She said that all Ukrainians are afraid “but you can’t be so scared as to not do anything. You can’t be passive.” When asked what she would say to British people facing painful choices caused by soaring energy costs, Volodymyr Zelensky’s wife told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “I understand the situation is very tough. But let me recall that at the time of the Covid-19 epidemic, and it’s still with us, when there were price hikes, Ukraine was affected as well. “The prices are going up in Ukraine as well. But in addition our people get killed. So when you start counting pennies on your bank account or in your pocket, we do the same and count our casualties,” she said. China’s top legislator, Li Zhanshu, will attend the seventh Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok this week, the official Xinhua news agency has reported, becoming the most senior Chinese official to visit Russia since the Ukraine war began. Reuters reported that Li, chairman of the National People’s Congress standing committee, will pay official visits to Russia, Mongolia, Nepal and South Korea from Wednesday to 17 September, according to Xinhua. He would attend the four-day forum – set to begin on Monday – during his stay in Russia, it said on Sunday. Li, who is ranked No. 3 in the Chinese Communist party, is due to retire from his party position at a party congress next month, but will keep his parliamentary position until March. China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin announced a “no limit” strategic partnership in February, weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine’s armed forces have given their latest official estimate of Russian losses in the war so far. They say 49,500 Russian troops have lost their lives since February but these figures are not possible to verify. The Kyiv Independent has made a useful graphic here. Ukrainian Evgeniy Maloletka has won the Visa d’Or, one of photojournalism’s most prestigious prizes, for his work during the Russian siege of Mariupol. Maloletka, 35, was visibly moved as he dedicated his prize to the Ukrainian people at a ceremony in Perpignan in southern France on Saturday, Agence France-Presse reported. Maloletka works for Associated Press and was among the first journalists to enter Mariupol on 23 February, an hour before the first Russian bombs fell. He was also one of the last to leave, on 15 March, by which time the southern Ukrainian city been almost entirely destroyed by Russian shelling. Those 20 days he spent there were like one long, unending day, “becoming worse and worse”, he said. His pictures showed the full horrors of the conflict and the Russian bombardment: children killed during the siege, heavily pregnant women lying among the ruins of bombed-out buildings, hastily improvised common graves. The other two photographers nominated were Daniel Berehulak, an Australian of Ukrainian origin, and Marcus Yam. The war in Ukraine has been a dominant theme at the International Festival of Photojournalism, which opened on 27 August. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmygal, is set to visit Germany on Sunday – the first high-level Ukrainian official to visit the country in months. The trip is a sign of eased tensions after a rocky patch between Kyiv and Berlin, Agence France-Presse reports. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has repeatedly vowed Germany’s strong support for Ukraine in its battle against Russia’s invasion. But in the immediate weeks after Russian troops marched on Ukraine, Kyiv criticised German aid as too little and too late. A visit by Scholz to Kyiv in June and the arrival of weapons from Germany have since led to a change in tone. Shmygal told German media ahead of his trip, in a transcript published by his press office: Germany has made huge progress in its support of Ukraine with weapons. But the prime minister said Kyiv needed more from Berlin, including “modern combat tanks” such as the Leopard 2. Scholz is to welcome Shmygal with military honours in the Sunday afternoon. Shmygal will to start his day with talks in the morning with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose offer to travel to Kyiv in April was rebuffed, sparking a row. Russian forces are suffering from “morale and discipline issues” in addition to combat fatigue and high casualties, the UK Ministry of Defence says. A main grievance from troops probably continued to be around pay, including the high chance that “sizeable combat bonuses” were not being paid, the latest British intelligence update said. At least some “outright corruption” among commanders was probably involved, as well as an “inefficient military bureaucracy”, it said. The Russian military has consistently failed to provide basic entitlements to troops deployed in Ukraine, including appropriate uniform, arms and rations as well as pay. This has almost certainly contributed to the continued fragile morale of much of the force. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s ongoing live coverage of the war in Ukraine, now it its 193rd day. Here are latest developments as it passes 9.30am in Kyiv. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and is relying on a reserve line, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Previously, there had been reports the plant in south-eastern Ukraine had been knocked offline in the early hours of Saturday amid sustained shelling that destroyed a key power line, according to local Russian-backed authorities. Sweden has said it would provide liquidity guarantees to Nordic and Baltic energy companies worth “billions of dollars” in an effort to prevent a financial crisis sparked by Europe’s energy crunch. The Russian energy company Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for them to carry out the work. The European Union expects Russia to respect existing energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so, the economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said. Gazprom’s announcement that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 would not restart came after G7 finance ministers said they planned to implement a price cap on Russian oil to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression”. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told Vladimir Putin that his country can play a facilitator role regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, according to his office. An eight-year-old child has died after Russian shelling in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv on Sunday morning, according to the head of the regional council, Hanna Zamazeyeva. Two other children were among those injured in Russian shelling in the city of Mykolaiv and Bereznehuvate, she said in an update on Telegram. Russian troops launched overnight rocket attacks on Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine, according to the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko. The leader of Chechnya has reportedly said he plans to take an “indefinite and long” break from his post. In a video posted to his Telegram, Ramzan Kadyrov, 45, reportedly said he believed the “time has come” for him to leave. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has accused the west of playing a “chess game with death” in its support of Ukraine and accused western countries of trying to take advantage of the conflict to push Russia to “a new round of disintegration”. Ukrainian forces have “likely achieved a degree of tactical surprise” with the ongoing counter-offensive, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its daily intelligence briefing, it said Ukraine had done so by taking advantage of “poor logistics, administration and leadership” in Russia’s military. Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has said in a BBC interview that while the economic impact of the war in Ukraine is tough on its allies, Britons “count pennies” while Ukrainians “count casualties”. Russians paid their final respects to Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, in a ceremony held in Moscow without much fanfare and with President Vladimir Putin notably absent. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, travelled to Moscow to pay his respects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/19/china-may-be-on-brink-of-supplying-arms-to-russia-says-blinken","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-19T15:05:32Z","webTitle":"China may be on brink of supplying arms to Russia, says Blinken","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/19/china-may-be-on-brink-of-supplying-arms-to-russia-says-blinken","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/19/china-may-be-on-brink-of-supplying-arms-to-russia-says-blinken","fields":{"headline":"China may be on brink of supplying arms to Russia, says Blinken","bodyText":"The US has said it believes China may be about to provide lethal aid to help Russia in the war in Ukraine, prompting a direct warning against doing so from the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to China’s top diplomat. Blinken made the warning to the Chinese state councillor Wang Yi on Saturday evening at a meeting on the sidelines of the Munich security conference during which he also rebuked China over the use of an alleged spy balloon over US soil. In a blunt meeting he also urged China to stop helping Russia evade the impact of sanctions. China’s trade with Russia is increasing and it has been buying Russian oil, but probably below the US$60 per barrel price cap imposed by the EU and G7 group of states. Blinken told US networks that the US had information China was considering whether to give Russia assistance, possibly including guns and weapons, for the Ukraine war. “The concern that we have now is, based on information we have, that they’re considering providing lethal support,” Blinken told CBS’s Face the Nation shortly after he met with Wang. “And we’ve made very clear to them that that could cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship.” Blinken told NBC’s Meet the Press that China has not yet crossed the line of providing lethal assistance but he would be putting out evidence soon to show how Beijing was seriously considering providing Russia with equipment including weapons He said of his meeting with Wang there was no apology from China about the spy balloon over US soil. “This was an opportunity to speak very clearly and very directly about the fact that China sent a surveillance balloon over our territory, violating our sovereignty, violating international law. And I told him quite simply that that was unacceptable and can never happen again.” The US believes China may already be providing some surveillance information to the Wagner group, the mercenary wing that works alongside the Russian army. Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, in her speech to the security conference warned China against providing lethal equipment to a country that she said the US had judged was committing crimes against humanity. But Harris in her remarks did not assert that such lethal aid was about to be provided. The US warnings about China’s intentions come in the context of a Chinese proposal to reveal a peace plan for Ukraine in a speech by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, coinciding with the 24 February anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Wang revealed the intention to launch the plan in his speech to the security conference on Saturday, and has been briefing leaders from France, Germany and Italy on China’s intentions, possibly in a bid to drive a wedge between EU states and the US. The US has indicated it believes the plan is likely to be a vague assertion of the value of peaceful dialogue, territorial integrity and sovereignty, but without going into any details. European diplomats briefed on the plans also seemed sceptical about the value of a broad enunciation of vague principles, questioning whether China was really prepared to distance itself from its close partner Russia. On the other hand, China is probably the only external actor that could put effective diplomatic pressure on the Russian president, Vladimiir Putin, to rethink his strategy. Expressing the west’s scepticism, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said: “China has not been able to condemn the invasion,” adding the plan “is quite vague”. Peace was only possible if Russia respected Ukraine’s sovereignty, he said. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dymytro Kuleba, was due to meet Wang on Sunday and expressed hope that China’s foreign policy principles would drive Beijing to accept the Ukrainian case. “We believe that compliance with the principle of territorial integrity is China’s fundamental interest in the international arena. And that commitment to the observance and protection of this principle is a driving force for China, greater than other arguments offered by Ukraine, the United States, or any other country,” he said. Some fear the plan may be designed to head off support in the so-called global south for any resolution to the UN general assembly asserting support for Ukraine. Such a resolution either at the general assembly or to the smaller UN security council has been under discussion to mark the anniversary. The last time the issue was addressed by the general assembly, Ukraine received the support of 141 states, and it may be hard to increase that level of support. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, welcomed any effort by China to use its influence with Moscow, telling reporters she had “talked intensively” with Wang during a bilateral meeting on Friday about “what a just peace means: not rewarding the attacker, the aggressor, but standing up for international law and for those who have been attacked”. “A just peace,” she added, “presupposes that the party that has violated territorial integrity – meaning Russia – withdraws its troops from the occupied country.” In the speeches of both the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, there was no support for early peace talks, with both men saying the west may have to endure a long conflict. Wang in his speech suggested there was a chance Europe was more eager to settle than the US. He said: “We need to think calmly, especially our friends in Europe, about what efforts should be made to stop the warfare; what framework should there be to bring lasting peace to Europe; what role should Europe play to manifest its strategic autonomy.” There were other sentiments in Wang’s outline plan that the west can welcome, including its opposition to the use of threats of nuclear war, or attacks on civilian nuclear power stations. The references to the UN charter and territorial integrity may also be helpful to the west, but it was coupled with a reference to Russia having legitimate security concerns. Some diplomats welcomed the acknowledgment that China could no longer simply treat the war as a strictly European matter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/24/nationalised-energy-could-save-uk-households-up-to-4400-tuc-says","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-24T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Nationalised energy could save UK households up to £4,400, TUC says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/24/nationalised-energy-could-save-uk-households-up-to-4400-tuc-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/24/nationalised-energy-could-save-uk-households-up-to-4400-tuc-says","fields":{"headline":"Nationalised energy could save UK households up to £4,400, TUC says","bodyText":"British households will each miss out on up to £4,400 over the next two years because the UK does not have a nationalised energy generation company, the Trades Union Congress has said. The UK’s main trade union body is calling on the government to set up a “public energy champion” that could own low-carbon energy projects from wind and solar to tidal and nuclear power. In a new analysis seen by the Guardian, the TUC estimates that the government could use excess profits made by this public company to cut bills and insulate homes, improving their energy efficiency. The TUC argues that if the UK had a state-backed energy generation company akin to France’s EDF, EnBW in Germany or Sweden’s Vattenfall, it would receive between £63bn and £122bn in revenues over the next two years. That is equivalent to between £2,250 and £4,400 a household. The government has attempted to retrospectively take a cut from the unexpected gains made by energy producers this year. In May the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak, introduced a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers. However, Liz Truss has resisted calls for a similar levy on low-carbon electricity generators, which have benefited from the surge in the price of gas. Instead, her government is attempting to negotiate new contracts with operators. The TUC study argues that having a fully privatised energy generation market has left Britons with higher bills and created a dependence on foreign technology, investment and skills. Its general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Privatisation has led to higher bills and colder homes. We need a fairer, greener approach that stops energy companies using UK families like cash machines. “French, Swedish and German families benefit from public ownership of electricity – why shouldn’t we? If we set up our own UK public energy champion, we can have lower bills, free home improvements to reduce our energy needs, and a safer climate for future generations.” The TUC research argues that public ownership of generation firms has allowed European nations to keep down prices, reinvest in communities and deliver on industrial strategy. However, critics may point to the nearly €10bn sum the French government has had to pay to fully nationalise debt-laden EDF. The study builds on a TUC proposal announced in July to nationalise five of the biggest energy companies to bring down bills. It estimated it would cost £2.85bn to nationalise the big five supply firms – British Gas, E.ON, EDF, Scottish Power and Ovo. Some forecasts estimate the government could spend more than £4bn bailing out Bulb, which collapsed last year. The TUC proposals were backed by the Green party. The party’s co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: “It’s important there’s more government ownership across all parts of the energy market so that we can ensure a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewables and secure our energy needs for the future. “We do also need to support a diverse range of ownership models for energy generators and suppliers including local community, cooperatives and municipal that are close to the people they serve and can innovate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/11/russian-warplanes-destroyed-in-crimea-saky-airbase-attack-satellite-images-show","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-11T15:56:57Z","webTitle":"Russian warplanes destroyed in Crimea airbase attack, satellite images show ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/russian-warplanes-destroyed-in-crimea-saky-airbase-attack-satellite-images-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/11/russian-warplanes-destroyed-in-crimea-saky-airbase-attack-satellite-images-show","fields":{"headline":"Russian warplanes destroyed in Crimea airbase attack, satellite images show ","bodyText":"An estimated nine or more Russian warplanes appear to have been damaged or destroyed in the recent attack on Saky airbase in Crimea, according to newly released satellite images, in contrast to Russian claims that none were damaged. The vivid aerial photographs show charred remains of combat aircraft amid large areas of scorched earth, as evidence of the attack that took place on Tuesday afternoon more than 110 miles from the frontline. Ukraine’s air force said at least nine Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground at the airbase. Russia has said the attack killed one person, wounded 14 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Independent analysts at Oryx Research said at least 11 Russian jets – four Su-30SMs and seven Su-24s – were destroyed, based on analysis of the imagery released by satellite companies and Ukraine’s air force. Kyiv has not publicly claimed responsibility for the attack – although it is doing so in private – while an adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, suggested partisans operating behind Russian lines might have been involved. But the country’s defence ministry tweeted out a video revelling in the attack and telling Russian tourists it was not safe to holiday in Crimea. “No amount of sunscreen will protect them from the hazardous effects of smoking in unauthorised areas,” the ministry said, a standard phrase when referring to attacks for which Ukraine does not want to formally take responsibility. Oleh Zhdanov, an independent Ukrainian military analyst, said: “Official Kyiv has kept mum about it, but unofficially the military acknowledges that it was a Ukrainian strike.” Zelenskiy referred to the attack in his Wednesday evening address. “In just one day, the occupiers lost 10 combat aircraft: nine in Crimea and one more in the direction of Zaporizhzhia,” he said. “The occupiers also suffer new losses of armoured vehicles, warehouses with ammunition, logistics routes.” Russia has sought to downplay the attack, denying that any aircraft were damaged in the blasts and conceding only that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area at the base, one of a number used to launch air and missile attacks against Ukraine and patrol the Black Sea. Images taken by the private satellite operator Planet Labs at about 8am on 9 August – approximately four hours before the attack – and about 4.40pm on 10 August show aircraft parked outside were damaged or destroyed. The before-and-after images are the first independent confirmation of damage to the base. But it remains unclear how the attack took place. Eliot Higgins, the founder and director of the open-source investigative website Bellingcat, said in a series of tweets he “can’t think of a time Russia has lost this many air assets in one day in recent memory”. Higgins said he could make out three craters at what appeared to be storage sites. “One way to interpret those craters is precise strikes from a long-range munition,” he said, adding that the craters appeared to measure “about 20-25m wide … which would mean a pretty big munition”. Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, cryptically said the blasts were either caused by Ukrainian-made long-range weapons or the work of Ukrainian guerrillas operating in Crimea. Other analysts have said they cannot find any evidence for a missile strike in the videos of the incident, suggesting it was the work of special forces or guerrilla operators. The scale of the damage is likely to mean Russian official estimates of the number of casualties are an underestimate. As well as the dead and wounded, officials said 62 housing blocks had been damaged. In the last few days there have been a growing number of attacks and explosions at Russian bases behind enemy lines. Late on Wednesday a number of blasts were heard at an airstrip used by Russian forces in south-east Belarus. The Belarus state news agency said there were no casualties and “personnel took prompt extinguishing measures”. However, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, hinted at responsibility. “The epidemic of technical accidents at military airfields of Crimea and Belarus should be considered by [Russian] military as a warning: forget about Ukraine, take off the uniform and leave.” Elsewhere on Thursday, Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said Britain would send three more M270 rocket artillery systems to Ukraine, at an international weapons donor conference held in Copenhagen, Denmark. “President Putin will have gambled that come August, come a few months in, we will have all got bored of the conflict and the international community would have gone off in different directions. Well, today is proof of the opposite,” Wallace said. Denmark said the 26 participating countries had agreed to send €1.5bn worth of weapons, and the host said it would donate $113m worth of kit to help Kyiv in the nearly six-month-old war with Russia. The Ukrainian state energy company Energoatom said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was shelled five times by Russian forces on Thursday, including near the site where radioactive materials are stored. But it said nobody was injured and the situation at the plant remained under control. Earlier in the day, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass said Ukraine had shelled the plant for a second time on Thursday, citing the Russian-installed local administration. But the claim could not be verified. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, told the UN security council on Thursday that explosions at the Zaporizhzhia plant had cut some of the external electricity supply to the site, essential for the cooling systems in the reactor. One of the reactors had shut down as a result and emergency diesel generators had been turned on, he said. Grossi said his agency assessed there was no immediate threat to nuclear safety but “this could change at any moment”. He appealed for a team of IAEA inspectors to be allowed access to the nuclear power plant to assess its safety."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/03/russia-ukraine-war-european-commission-rejects-russias-fallacious-reason-for-shutting-nord-stream-gas-pipeline","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-03T18:20:17Z","webTitle":"Zaporizhzhia plant again loses last main power line; public bids farewell to Gorbachev at funeral – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/03/russia-ukraine-war-european-commission-rejects-russias-fallacious-reason-for-shutting-nord-stream-gas-pipeline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/03/russia-ukraine-war-european-commission-rejects-russias-fallacious-reason-for-shutting-nord-stream-gas-pipeline","fields":{"headline":"Zaporizhzhia plant again loses last main power line; public bids farewell to Gorbachev at funeral – as it happened","bodyText":"Here is a round-up of events today: Sweden has said it would provide liquidity guarantees to Nordic and Baltic energy companies worth “billions of dollars” in an effort to prevent a financial crisis sparked by Europe’s energy crunch, The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and is now relying on a reserve line, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement.

Sweden said it would provide liquidity guarantees to Nordic and Baltic energy companies worth “billions of dollars” in an effort to prevent a financial crisis sparked by Europe’s energy crunch, Agence France-Presse reports. The prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, warned that Sweden was facing the prospect of a “war winter”. Andersson said at a press conference in Stockholm that the guarantees were aimed at giving energy groups “the breathing room that is needed” and that there was “a clear security policy agenda behind Russia’s actions”. The exact details of the guarantees, she said, have yet to be worked out. Andersson added: Russia’s energy war is having serious consequences for Europe and Swedish households and companies, especially in southern Sweden which is dependent on electricity prices in Germany, which in turn is very dependent on gas. This threatens our financial stability. If we don’t act soon it could lead to serious disruptions in the Nordics and Baltics. In the worst-case scenario we could fall into a financial crisis.” Finance minister Mikael Damberg said the Swedish decision would “secure financial stability not only in Sweden but in the entire Nordic region”. The guarantees were expected to be in place on Monday and would cover the Nordic and Baltic regions within the next two weeks. Sweden’s parliament has been called in from its summer break to hold a vote on the government’s proposal on Monday. The global atomic energy watchdog has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and is now relying on a reserve line. Agence France-Presse reports: Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has once again lost the connection to its last remaining main external power line, but the facility is continuing to supply electricity to the grid through a reserve line, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was informed at the site today,” the agency said in a statement. Less than 48 hours after Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi on Thursday established the presence of the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to ZaporizhzhIa (ISAMZ) at the facility in southern Ukraine, the Agency’s experts were told by senior Ukrainian staff that the ZNPP’s fourth operational 750 Kilovolt (kV) power line was down. The three others were lost earlier during the conflict.” Here is a report from my colleague Andrew Roth: The Pillar Hall in the House of the Unions is a grand old ballroom where Soviet leaders are put on display when they die. Nearly a century ago, the body of Vladimir Lenin lay in state for three days before his funeral. Stalin and Brezhnev followed. Now Mikhail Gorbachev is here, pale in a spotlit coffin: the last Soviet leader finally being laid to rest. Vladimir Putin is not here, a snub that the Kremlin has said was a result of his busy work schedule. Yet thousands of Russians have come to pay their respects, lining up past the downtown theatres and trendy cafes, each person a reminder that Mikhail Gorbachev still remains a hero to some. “He did a lot, but people now in our country hate him,” Vladimir Gubarev, a retired journalist who lined up on Saturday morning bearing a few carnations, told the Observer. “People want to be happy fast. Immediately. The way of Gorbachev was the slow way to freedom, to real freedom. And he didn’t have enough time.” For many, coming to the hall was both an act of appreciation and one of defiance to honour the memory of a leader who brought new freedoms and hastened the collapse of his own country. “He was a great man, so immediately after his death, people say good words about him,” said Gubarev. “But only after he is gone. Because while he was alive, he was dangerous. He was the enemy.” You can read the full report here. Gorbachev’s funeral took place without state honours or the presence of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Reuters reports that the man “affectionately known as ‘Gorby’ in the West and who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 for his role in ending the Cold War” was buried at Moscow’s famous Novodevichy cemetery alongside his wife Raisa, who died in 1999. Best known in the West for helping end the Cold War, reducing his country’s nuclear stockpile, and for unwittingly presiding over the demise of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev’s legacy still divides opinion inside and outside Russia. But those who lined up to say farewell recalled the late politician, who died in Moscow after an unspecified illness, with gratitude. He was a peacemaker, he was one of God’s sons,” said Tatiana, 80, who said she had come despite poor health. Tycoon and close friend Alexander Lebedev said: “He wanted to give us democracy and freedom and we turned out to not be very ready yet. “That’s most unfortunate but we will still be a European country. This part of history will be over one day.” Here are some images from the funeral today of the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev who died on Tuesday aged 91. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The Russian energy major Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for them to carry out the work. Gazprom, the state-owned oil and gas firm, extended the shutdown of gas flows through its key Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany on Friday evening, citing “malfunctions” on a key turbine along the pipeline. The EU expects Russia to respect existing energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so, the economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said. Gentiloni was speaking after Russia scrapped a Saturday deadline to resume flows of an important gas supply route to Germany, deepening Europe’s difficulties in securing winter fuel. Gazprom’s announcement that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 would not restart came after the decision by G7 finance ministers that they plan to implement a price cap on Russian oil. In a statement, the ministers said the cap was designed to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression” and that they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure, but left out key details of the plan. The Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine was once again knocked offline in the early hours of Saturday, local Russian-backed authorities said. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Kremlin-appointed regional administration, claimed sustained shelling destroyed a key power line and penetrated deep into the plant’s premises. His claims could not be immediately verified. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told Vladimir Putin that his country can play a facilitator role regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, according to his office. The pair spoke in a phone call where they also discussed developments regarding Ukrainian grain exports, the Turkish presidency said in a statement. An eight-year-old child has died after Russian shelling in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv this morning, according to the head of the regional council, Hanna Zamazeyeva. Two other children were among those injured in Russian shelling in the city of Mykolaiv and Bereznehuvate, she said in an update on Telegram. Russian troops launched overnight rocket attacks on Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine, according to the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Russian forces also struck two enterprises in Sloviansk, damaging several houses, Kyrylenko added. Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, has reportedly said he plans to take an “indefinite and long” break from his post. In a video posted to his Telegram, Kadyrov, 45, reportedly said he believed the “time has come” for him to leave. Kadyrov has ruled Russia’s Chechnya republic with an iron fist since 2007. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has accused the west of playing a “chess game with death” in its support of Ukraine. Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, accused western countries of trying to take advantage of the conflict to push Russia to “a new round of disintegration”. Ukrainian forces have “likely achieved a degree of tactical surprise” with the ongoing counter-offensive, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its daily intelligence briefing, it said it had done so by taking advantage of “poor logistics, administration and leadership” in Russia’s military. Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has said that while the economic impact of the war in Ukraine is tough on its allies, Britons “count pennies” while Ukrainians “count casualties”. In an interview with the BBC due to be broadcast on Sunday, Zelenska said if support for Ukraine was strong the crisis would be shorter. Russians paid their final respects to the last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, in a ceremony held in Moscow without much fanfare and with President Vladimir Putin notably absent. Several thousand mourners queued up to quietly file past Gorbachev’s open casket that was flanked by honour guards under the Russian flag in the historic Hall of Columns. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, travelled to Moscow to pay his respects. Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, has reportedly said he plans to take an “indefinite and long” break from his post. Kadyrov, who has ruled Russia’s Chechnya republic with an iron fist since 2007, was in March promoted to lieutenant-general by Vladimir Putin for his role in the invasion of Ukraine. In a video posted to his Telegram, Kadyrov, 45, reportedly says he believes the “time has come” for him to leave. Kadyrov said: I realised that I have been sitting in my position for a long time. I think my time has come [to leave power]. The BBC’s Sarah Rainsford shared the video, writing: Is Kadyrov resigning or is this some weird Kadyrovism? Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has said that while the economic impact of the war in Ukraine is tough on its allies, Britons “count pennies” while Ukrainians “count casualties”. In an interview with the BBC, Zelenska said if support for Ukraine was strong the crisis would be shorter. The wife of Volodymyr Zelenskiy was asked what message she had for people in the UK who are facing soaring energy bills in part due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Zelenska said: I understand the situation is very tough. But let me recall that at the time of the Covid-19 epidemic, and it’s still with us, when there were price hikes, Ukraine was affected as well. The prices are going up in Ukraine as well. But in addition our people get killed. So when you start counting pennies on your bank account or in your pocket, we do the same and count our casualties. During the interview, which will be broadcast tomorrow, she said it was difficult for people outside Ukraine to understand the impact of the war on its people. It was, therefore, important to keep highlighting the human toll of the war, she said. She added: That’s why we have to tell these stories, to show these stories, because these are the faces of a war. Not a number of bombs dropped, not the amount of money spent, human stories - and there are a thousand stories like that around. An eight-year-old child has died after Russian shelling in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv this morning, according to the head of the regional council, Hanna Zamazeyeva. Two other children were among those injured in Russian shelling in the city of Mykolaiv and Bereznehuvate, she said in an update on Telegram. Zamazeyeva said: Today’s morning was especially difficult. Shelling continues. Unfortunately, there are victims. There are two wounded in the city of Mykolaiv, four in Bereznehuvate. Among those injured are two children. Unfortunately, an 8-year-old child [was killed]. She added: In addition to artillery shelling, air strikes on populated areas in the Pervomaiske, Shyroke and Bereznehuvate communities were recorded. Residential buildings and outbuildings were damaged. Fires broke out as a result of shelling. It has not been possible to independently verify this information. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said he has spoken with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, following a long-awaited visit by UN nuclear inspectors to the Zaporizhzhia plant in Ukraine. Michel paid tribute to the UN nuclear agency’s “courage and professionalism”, describing the 14-strong team’s mission to the Russian-occupied nuclear plant as “impressive”. The EU “fully supports” the IAEA’s work and efforts, he added. the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has accused the west of playing a “chess game with death” in its support for Ukraine. In a post on Vkontake, Russia’s largest social network, Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, accused western countries of trying to take advantage of the conflict to push Russia to “a new round of disintegration”. “To do everything so that the state institutions of Russia stop working,” he said. “To deprive the country of effective governance, as it was back in 1991. And, as a result, eliminate Russia from the political field.” He added that the “such attempts are really extremely dangerous” because they “ignore a simple axiom: the violent disintegration of a nuclear power is always a chess game with death”. He also described Russia’s nuclear arsenal as “the best guarantee of the preservation of Great Russia”. At least one woman has been injured in a strike on the southern city of Mykolaiv, the city’s mayor has said. Posting on Telegram, Oleksandr Senkevych said explosions were heard in the city at around 11:30am local time and that a garage had been struck. He said rescuers were working to extinguish a fire at the site and that the shockwave had also blown out the windows and doors of a nearby private residential building. One woman received shrapnel injuries, he said. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that his country can play a facilitator role regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, according to his office. The pair spoke in a phone call where they discussed developments regarding Ukrainian grain exports, the Turkish presidency said in a statement. They also expressed their determination to continue the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear plant in Turkey according to plans. They agreed to discuss the issues in detail when they meet in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, for a summit later this month, the office added. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has travelled to Moscow to pay his respects at the funeral of former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. There were no plans for Orbán to meet with Vladimir Putin during his trip to Moscow, Russian media reported, citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Peskov told Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti: As far as we know, he will only fly in to say goodbye to Gorbachev. There were no desires for meetings. Vladimir Putin is waging economic and psychological war by closing a major gas pipeline to Europe, a former energy industry boss has said. The decision by the Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom to extend the shutdown of gas flows through its Nord Stream 1 pipeline has left Britain “panicking”, according to Angela Knight, former chief executive of trade association Energy UK. Speaking to Times Radio today, Knight said the UK and Europe had become energy dependent on countries that were “not all that friendly”. She said: He’s (Putin) actually playing the economic war extremely well. He’s playing the psychological war extremely well. We have been panicking as a country - Europe has been panicking as well - and it’s not surprising and I’m not critical of it. Britain’s energy policy has been “wrong for a long, long time”, she added. “It’s a really nasty shock that we’ve had.” The European commissioner for the economy, Paolo Gentiloni, said the EU expects Russia to respect energy contracts it has agreed but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so. Asked about the halt to the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, Gentiloni pointed to high gas storage levels and said there were plans to conserve energy in the winter. He said: We expect Russia to respect the contracts that they have. But even if weaponisation of energy continues or increases, the EU is ready to react. Mykhailo Podolyak, a key Ukrainian presidential adviser, has said Kyiv will determine the end of the war when it has finished “liberating its territories” and demanding Russia pay reparations. Podolyak wrote on Twitter: [Russian Federation] officials repeat weird mantra: “Special military operation will be completed on time”, “The West delays its completion”. It looks like they did not understand anything. Ukraine will determine the ending war term by liberating its territories. As well as reparations payments amount. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, earlier this week extended his “special military operation” and reportedly ordered his troops to capture the Donetsk region by 15 September, rather than the original 31 August deadline. The Russian energy major Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for them to carry out the work. Gazprom, the state-owned oil and gas firm, extended the shutdown of gas flows through its key Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany on Friday evening, citing “malfunctions” on a key turbine along the pipeline. It said the pipeline would not restart until repairs were fully implemented, without providing a timeframe for a reopening. In a statement today, Gazprom said Siemens Energy was taking part in repair work in accordance with an existing contract between the two companies and was ready to fix faults which Gazprom said had forced it to halt gas supply to Germany through the pipeline. Russian troops launched overnight rocket attacks on Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine, according to the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko. In an update posted to his Telegram account, Kyrylenko said: In Kramatorsk, a rocket hit a food enterprise, injuring a person. Another one hit a light industry enterprise. A fire broke out there. Russian forces also struck two enterprises in Sloviansk, damaging several houses, Kyrylenko added. Vadym Liakh, the mayor of Sloviansk, confirmed the city was under attack, writing on Facebook: The city was shelled again. There were loud explosions on the outskirts. In Bylbasivka, private houses were damaged on Shkilna and Yaseneva Streets. My colleague Andrew Roth is covering the farewell ceremony of Mikhail Gorbachev, which is being held in the Hall of Pillars in Moscow’s House of the Unions today. The funeral of Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, will take place today without state honours or the presence of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Mourners began queuing up near the Kremlin this morning to pay their last respects to Gorbachev, who died on Tuesday aged 91. Gorbachev is the first Russian leader since Nikita Khrushchev not to receive an official state funeral in what has been widely seen as a snub by the Russian president. He was, however, granted a public send-off, with authorities allowing Russians to view his coffin in the Hall of Columns, where previous Soviet leaders have been mourned. The farewell ceremony will be followed by a closed funeral in the Novodevichy cemetery. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said schedule constraints meant Putin would not attend a public farewell ceremony at Moscow’s House of Unions, or the funeral at Novodevichy cemetery today. Putin did pay his respects to the Soviet leader on Thursday morning, leaving flowers by Gorbachev’s coffin at the mourning hall of Moscow’s Central Clinical hospital. Russia has expressed “alarm” to the UN’s secretary general that the US has yet to issue visas for its delegation to attend a session of the general assembly later this month, according to a letter seen by Agence France-Presse. “None of the 56 Russian representatives from the main team and advance group have received entry visas to the United States” as of Thursday, Russian ambassador Vasily Nebenzia wrote in a letter addressed to the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres. Nebenzia added that a “similar situation exists with the accompanying journalists and crew members” on the flight of the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov is set to lead Russia’s delegation to the UN general assembly from 20-26 September. Nebenzia added: This is even more alarming since for the last several months the authorities of the United States have been constantly refusing to grant entry visas to a number of Russian delegates assigned to take part in the official United Nations events. Russia’s halting of gas deliveries to Germany via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for an indefinite period is set to worsen Europe’s energy crisis. The Russian-owned gas giant Gazprom said on Friday that the pipeline, which was due to reopen on Saturday, would remain shut until a turbine was repaired. Gazprom indicated it had discovered “oil leaks” in a turbine while carrying out maintenance with representatives of Siemens, which manufactured the turbine, and published a picture on Telegram of cables covered in a brown liquid. Earlier, the Kremlin warned the future operation of the Nord Stream pipeline – the biggest pipeline for gas from Russia to Europe – was at risk due to a lack of spare parts. The turbine-maker Siemens Energy said in a statement that the oil leaks blamed by Gazprom was “not a technical reason for stopping operation”, adding that it was “not contracted for maintenance work. Such leakages do not usually affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site. Following the imposition of sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has reduced or halted gas supplies to different European nations, causing energy prices to soar. The Kremlin has blamed the sanctions for the reduced supplies. As winter approaches, European nations have been seeking to completely fill their gas reserves, secure alternative supplies and put into place plans to reduce consumption. The Russian energy major Gazprom extended the shutdown of gas flows through its key Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany on Friday evening, providing no timeframe for a reopening. The move came hours after G7 countries agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil in an attempt to stem the flow of funds to Vladimir Putin’s regime. Gazprom, the state-owned oil and gas firm, said supplies would remain halted indefinitely after a leak was detected. It said the pipeline would not restart until repairs were fully implemented. Nord Stream 1 is the single biggest pipeline for gas from Russia to Europe and has the capacity to deliver 55bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year. Continued supplies through the pipeline are seen as crucial to prevent a deepening of the energy crisis. In a statement on Telegram, Gazprom said: Gas transportation to the Nord Stream gas pipeline has been completely halted until the complaints on the operation of the equipment have been eliminated. It said in the social media post it had identified “malfunctions” on a key turbine along the pipeline, which carries natural gas from western Russia to Germany, and that the pipeline would not work unless these were eliminated. Early on Wednesday, Gazprom completely halted the flow of gas through Nord Stream 1, in line with an earlier announcement, adding that the stoppage would last for three days. Flows were due to resume just after midnight on Saturday morning. Read the full article by Alex Lawson here. Ukrainian forces have “likely achieved a degree of tactical surprise” with the ongoing counter-offensive, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its daily intelligence briefing, it said it had done so by taking advantage of “poor logistics, administration and leadership” in Russia’s military. It said: Since 29 August 2022, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been conducting renewed offensive operations in the south of Ukraine. One element of this offensive is an ongoing advance on a broad front west of the Dnipro River, focusing on three axes within Russian-occupied Kherson Oblast. The operation has limited immediate objectives, but Ukraine’s forces have likely achieved a degree of tactical surprise; exploiting poor logistics, administration and leadership in the Russian armed forces. With fighting also continuing in the Donbas and Kharkiv sectors, a key decision for Russian commanders in coming days will be where to commit any operational reserve force they can generate. Ukraine’s military said it had carried out strikes against Russian positions in the region around the southern town of Enerhodar on Friday, near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant where UN experts are working. Reuters reports that the revelation by the armed forces’ general staff was unusual because the military rarely gives details of specific targets. The staff said in a Facebook post: It has been confirmed that in the region around the towns of Kherson and Enerhodar, precise strikes by our armed forces destroyed three enemy artillery systems as well as a warehouse with ammunition and up to a company of soldiers. It did not give more details about the strikes. A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency is gathering data at the Zaporizhzhia station, on the edge of Russian-occupied Enerhoda, which is about 300km (185 miles) from Kherson. Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shelling the nuclear plant, while Kyiv says pro-Moscow forces are responsible for attacking it. The Russian energy company Gazprom announced that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 would not restart on schedule on Saturday, citing turbine damage. Gazprom’s CEO, Alexei Miller, indicated Siemens could not carry out repairs because of sanctions. The European Commission chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, said Gazprom was staging the shutdown “under fallacious pretences”. The shutdown of the single biggest pipeline for gas from Russia to Europe will stoke concerns over the reliability of winter energy supplies. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, who returned from a first visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, said six of the team’s experts remained at the site to continue the work. He told reporters the mission would produce a report early next week of its findings. Grossi said military operations were increasing in the region of the plant, “which worries me a lot”. He said the military presence was not available when he asked to speak to them about the control centre, they did not approach his team and they were “withdrawn” throughout their visit to the Russian-controlled facility in south-eastern Ukraine . Finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) nations have announced they plan to implement a price cap on Russian oil. In a statement, the ministers said the cap was designed to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression” and that they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure, but left out key details of the plan. Prior to the G7 announcement, the Kremlin said imposing the price cap would trigger Russian retaliation. If G7 leaders went ahead it would lead to significant destabilisation of the global oil market, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Ukraine’s military has claimed that Russian forces suffered “significant losses” in the southern region of Kherson following Kyiv’s counteroffensive launched earlier this week. Ukraine’s successes have been “quite convincing”, according to a spokesperson for the southern Ukrainian military command, who added that more “positive news” would likely follow “very soon”. Ukrainian troops have pushed back Russian forces at several points around Kherson, according to western officials. Officials estimate that about 20,000 Russian troops are in the pocket of the southern region, and caution that it is too soon to determine if Ukraine’s counterattack is working. The “physical integrity” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been “violated several times”, Rafael Grossi said. The IAEA chief said after leading the inspection team that while he would continue to worry about the plant, the situation was “more predictable” now. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of manipulating and distorting information shared with the IAEA. Ukrainian state-owned operator Energoatom said Russian officials “are making every effort to prevent the IAEA mission from getting to know the real state of affairs. They spread manipulative and false information about this visit.” The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has accused Ukraine of “nuclear terrorism”. Pro-Russian proxy authorities in Zaporizhzhia have accused Kyiv of trying to smuggle “spies” into the IAEA inspection team posing as journalists. The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin, has restated the expansionist military aims of Russia’s invasion. “Our task is to liberate all Russian cities that were founded by Russian people during the time of the Russian Empire, and developed during the Soviet Union thanks to the help of our entire vast country,” Pushilin said. “This is not only the territories of Novorossia [the Donbas], but also much wider. It will not be any other way.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

You can read all our Ukraine coverage here. Vladimir Putin’s agreement to allow independent inspectors to travel to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the French president, comes as concerns grow over fighting near the Russian-occupied site. Olaf Scholz has praised Alexei Navalny on the second anniversary of the jailed Russian opposition politician’s attempted poisoning. The US is planning to buy about 150,000 metric tonnes of grain from Ukraine in the next few weeks for an upcoming shipment of food aid from ports no longer blockaded by war, the World Food Programme chief has said. Multiple children have reportedly been injured following a Russian strike on a residential building in the Mykolaiv region of Ukraine. The US deputy treasury secretary, Wally Adeyemo, told Turkey’s deputy finance minister, Yunus Elitas, that Russian entities and individuals were attempting to use Turkey to bypass western sanctions imposed over Moscow’s war in Ukraine, the US treasury department said. In a phone call, the department said, the two also discussed efforts to implement and enforce sanctions against Russia, Reuters reports. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, has praised the “moving” sight of Ukrainian wheat headed for eastern Africa as part of an operation by the World Food Programme. Ukraine has launched a fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters at Sevastopol, where officials in the annexed Crimean peninsula said that at least one drone had been shot down by air defences. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine, posted this uplifting tweet: Shortly before his two-day trip to Canada, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, received support for his interest in Canadian liquid natural gas to help replace Russian gas imports from an unexpected ally, Ukrainian state-owned gas company Naftogaz. Kyiv has been at loggerheads with Berlin over its deal with Moscow to build the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and more recently over its deal with Canada to get a repaired turbine for the Nord Stream 1 delivered back to Germany. But the prospect of LNG deliveries to Europe from Canada is something that Naftogaz has also been working on itself. Naftogaz’s CEO, Yuriy Vitrenko, told Reuters that Canadian gas had many advantages. “Canadian suppliers do not have dominance in the German market, do not abuse it, as Gazprom, who is artificially decreasing supplies, ‘cornering the market’, and ripping off its customers,” he said. Ukraine’s ambassador to Ireland said her country had proved itself a “reliable partner” under a UN-backed deal allowing grain exports, as a shipment arrived in the southern Irish port of Foynes. The vessel, the Panama-flagged Navi Star carrying 33,000 tonnes of grain, arrived in Ireland after leaving southern Ukraine’s main port of Odesa two weeks ago. The shipment was one of the first to leave the war-torn country under a landmark deal struck with Russia and brokered by Turkey and the United Nations. Ukraine’s ambassador to Ireland, Larysa Gerasko, told AFP her country had proved itself a “reliable partner and reliable global grain exporter”. She said the continuation of shipments ultimately “depends on Russia, on Russian actions”, adding: “We expect Russia to keep to its commitments under the Black Sea grain initiative.” A message from António Guterres, the UN secretary general, on the World Food Programme effort. The destroyed Russian military vehicles have been on display in Kyiv ahead of Ukraine’s Independence Day on Wednesday. The US deputy treasury secretary, Wally Adeyemo, told Turkey’s deputy finance minister, Yunus Elitas, that Russian entities and individuals were attempting to use Turkey to bypass western sanctions imposed over Moscow’s war in Ukraine, the US treasury department said.

Multiple children have reportedly been injured following a Russian strike on a residential building in the Mykolaiv region of Ukraine. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, has praised the “moving” sight of Ukrainian wheat headed for eastern Africa as part of an operation by the World Food Programme. Ukraine has launched a fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters at Sevastopol, where officials in the annexed Crimean peninsula said that at least one drone had been shot down by air defences. Russia has claimed that Ukraine poisoned some of its servicemen in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia in late July. However, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry said in response that the alleged poisoning could have been caused by Russian forces eating expired canned meat. This has not been independently verified by the Guardian. Reuters reports: The Russian defence ministry said a number of Russian servicemen had been taken to a military hospital with signs of serious poisoning on 31 July. Tests showed a toxic substance, botulinum toxin type B, in their bodies, it said. “On the fact of chemical terrorism sanctioned by the Zelenskiy regime, Russia is preparing supporting evidence with the results of all the analyses,” the ministry said in a statement. It did not say how many servicemen had suffered or what their condition was now. It did not say what the “supporting evidence” was. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny has tweeted the following thread on the two-year anniversary of his poisoning with the nerve agent Novichok. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said that governments and the private sector should cooperate to bring Russian food and fertilisers as well as Ukrainian grain to world markets under a deal agreed last month. Speaking to a news conference in Istanbul, Guterres said: “The other part of this package deal is the unimpeded access to the global markets of Russian food and fertiliser, which are not subject to sanctions. “It is important that all governments and the private sector cooperate to bring them to market. “Getting more food and fertiliser out of Ukraine and Russia is crucial to further calm commodity markets and lower prices for consumers.” A Russian missile hit a residential area of a Ukrainian town, wounding 12 civilians and heightening fears of a nuclear accident during the war in Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, said on the Telegram messaging app that four children were among those wounded in an attack that damaged several private houses and a five-storey apartment building in Voznesensk. Reuters reports: The town is about 30 km (19 miles) from the Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant (PNPP), the second largest in Ukraine. State-run Energoatom, which manages all four Ukrainian nuclear energy generators, described the attack on Voznesensk as “another act of Russian nuclear terrorism”. “It is possible that this missile was aimed specifically at the Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant, which the Russian military tried to seize back at the beginning of March,” Energoatom said in a statement. The town of Enerhodar, where the Zaporizhzhia plant – Europe’s largest – is located, has come under repeated shelling, with Moscow and Kyiv trading blame for the attacks. Emma Graham-Harrison, senior international affairs correspondent at the Guardian, has tweeted this photo from Kyiv of a child posing on a tank. You can read the Guardian’s full report of Ukraine’s strikes on Russia’s Black Seat Fleet headquarters here: Ukraine has launched a fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters at Sevastopol, where officials in the annexed Crimean peninsula said that at least one drone had been shot down by air defences. The reported attack on Saturday morning – a day after explosions erupted near military bases in Russian-held areas of Ukraine and Russia itself – came amid cautious optimism elsewhere as two more grain ships left a Ukrainian port. The shipments, from Chornomorsk port, brought the total number to leave Ukraine’s Black Sea under a UN-brokered deal to 27. A £65m superyacht of a Russian oligarch hit by sanctions will be auctioned off by the Gibraltar government on Tuesday, becoming the first of the luxury vessels to be sold off since restrictions were imposed on hundreds of rich Russians after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. However, the 72.5-metre Axioma is not being sold for the benefit of the Ukrainian people but for a US investment bank, JP Morgan, which claims the yacht’s billionaire owner, Dmitry Pumpyansky, owes it more than $20m (£17m). The vessel, which features six luxurious guest cabins, a swimming pool, a 3D cinema room, gym, jacuzzi and a fully equipped spa, was detained after docking in Gibraltar in March. Pumpyansky, the owner and chairman of the steel pipe manufacturer OAO TMK, a supplier to the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom, was subjected to sanctions by the UK, EU and the US after the invasion of Ukraine. The UK said the billionaire, who it said had built up an estimated £1.84bn fortune, was one of the oligarchs “closest to Putin”. Robert Neate’s full report is below: Lloyd J. Austin III, US secretary of defense, has tweeted regarding the $775m support package the country is providing for Ukraine. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, has praised the “moving” sight of Ukrainian wheat headed for eastern Africa as part of an operation by the World Food Programme. Ukraine is “trolling” Moscow with a parade of Russian military vehicles in Kyiv on Saturday, reports senior international affairs correspondent Emma Graham-Harrison: Multiple children have reportedly been injured following a Russian strike on a residential building in the Mykolaiv region of Ukraine. One girl’s eye was torn out by shrapnel, according to Nexta, following the attack on the five-story building in Voskresenske. A BBC Ukraine journalist, who tweeted a picture of the damaged building, said four children aged three to 17 were seriously injured and five adults were injured: Olaf Scholz has praised Alexei Navalny on the second anniversary of the jailed Russian opposition politician’s attempted poisoning. The German chancellor also criticised Russia’s clampdown on freedom of speech. “The war that Russia started against Ukraine is a war that also has consequences for Russia,” Scholz said in a video message on Saturday. “Freedom and democracy were already endangered before. But now, freedom of expression is much more endangered and many fear to say their own opinion.” He said it was important to remember Navalny because he was fighting for his belief that “one lives in a democracy and state governed by the rule of law”. The US is planning to buy about 150,000 metric tonnes of grain from Ukraine in the next few weeks for an upcoming shipment of food aid from ports no longer blockaded by war, the World Food Programme chief has told the Associated Press. The Associated Press reports: The final destinations for the grain are not confirmed and discussions continue, David Beasley said. But the planned shipment, one of several the U.N. agency that fights hunger is pursuing, is more than six times the amount of grain that the first WFP-arranged ship from Ukraine is now carrying toward people in the Horn of Africa at risk of starvation. Beasley spoke Friday from northern Kenya, which is deep in a drought that is withering the Horn of Africa region. He sat under a thorn tree among local women who told the AP that the last time it rained was in 2019. Their bone-dry communities face yet another failed rainy season within weeks that could tip parts of the region, especially neighbouring Somalia, into famine. Already, thousands of people have died. The World Food Programme says 22 million people are hungry. “I think there’s a high probability we’ll have a declaration of famine” in the coming weeks, Beasley said. The keenly awaited first aid ship from Ukraine is carrying 23,000 metric tons of grain, enough to feed 1.5 million people on full rations for a month, Beasley said. It is expected to dock in Djibouti on Aug. 26 or 27, and the wheat is supposed to be shipped overland to northern Ethiopia, where millions of people in the Tigray, Afar and Amhara regions have faced not only drought but deadly conflict. Ukraine was the source of half the grain that WFP bought last year to feed 130 million hungry people. Russia and Ukraine signed agreements with the U.N. and the Turkish government last month to enable exports of Ukrainian grain for the first time since Russia’s invasion in February. But the slow reopening of Ukraine’s ports and the cautious movement of cargo ships across the mined Black Sea won’t solve the global food security crisis, Beasley said. He warned that richer countries must do much more to keep grain and other assistance flowing to the hungriest parts of the world, and he named names. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has posted its latest defence intelligence update. In case you missed it last night, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, gave a video address to the nation, vowing that every Russian strike on the country would be answered. Zelenskyy said: All those who experience this constant horror of the destruction of life and the destruction of everything that gives life normality. We will not leave any of these strikes unanswered. We will establish the identity of every occupier who gives orders and executes these strikes at cities. And we will bring them all to justice in one way or another. No murderer will hide. You can listen and read a transcription of the full address here. Ukraine’s defence ministry say that in total they have killed 44,900 Russian personnel, an increase of 200 on the previous day. These figures have not been independently verified by the Guardian. There have been multiple reports of an explosion in Crimea on Saturday morning, with an unmanned aerial vehicle striking the Black Sea fleet’s headquarters in Sevastopol. IZ.RU reports on Telegram that, according to the governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhaev, a drone flew into the roof of the headquarters of the Black Sea fleet, before being shot down over naval headquarters. He posted a picture online, saying nobody was hurt. Razvozhaey added that no one was hurt. Ukraine has not commented on the reported attacks. The Guardian has not independently verified this report. Here is a roundup of what we know as of yesterday regarding the Russia-Ukraine war. Turkey has said that two more ships carrying grain have left Ukraine’s Chornomorsk port, bringing the total number of vessels to leave Ukraine’s Black Sea ports under a UN-brokered grain export deal to 27. Reuters reports: The Zumrut Ana and MV Ocean S, which are authorized to depart on Aug. 20, were loaded with 6,300 tonnes of sunflower oil and 25,000 tonnes of wheat respectively, the joint coordination centre set up to enable safe passage said in a statement. Ukraine’s Sea Ports Authority said on Saturday three Ukrainian seaports had begun loading food onto seven ships, which would deliver 66,500 tonnes of wheat, corn and sunflower oil to consumers. Ukraine’s grain exports have slumped since the start of the war because its Black Sea ports – a vital route for shipments – were closed, driving up global food prices and prompting fears of shortages in Africa and the Middle East. At the end of July, three Black Sea ports were unblocked under a deal between Moscow and Kyiv, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. In its daily intelligence briefing, the UK’s Ministry of Defence says: The last week has seen only minimal changes in territorial control along the frontline. In the Donbas, after small advances from early August, Russian forces have approached the outskirts of the town of Bakhmut, but have not yet broken into the built-up area. Russia has not made any major efforts to advance in the Zaporizhzhia or Kharkiv sectors. In the south-west, neither Ukrainian nor Russian forces have made advances on the Kherson frontline. However, it adds the “increasingly frequent explosions behind Russian lines are probably stressing Russian logistics and air basing in the south”. Russia has reported fresh Ukrainian drone attacks, a day after explosions erupted near military bases in Russian-held areas of Ukraine and in Russia. The latest apparent displays of Kyiv’s growing ability to pummel Moscow’s assets far from frontlines occurred on Friday evening, Reuters reported, and followed huge blasts last week at an air base in Russian-annexed Crimea. In a new assessment, a western official said the earlier explosions had rendered half of Russia’s Black Sea naval aviation force useless. Russia’s RIA and Tass news agencies, citing a local official in Crimea, said it appeared Russian anti-aircraft forces had been in action near the western Crimean port of Yevpatoriya on Friday night. Video posted by a Russian website showed what appeared to be a ground-to-air missile hitting a target. Tass cited a local official as saying Russian anti-aircraft forces knocked down six Ukrainian drones sent to attack the town of Nova Kakhovka, east of the city of Kherson. Ukraine says retaking Kherson is one of its main priorities. Separately, an official in Crimea said defences there had downed an unspecified number of drones over the city of Sevastopol. Vladimir Putin’s agreement to allow independent inspectors to travel to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the French presidency, comes as concerns grow over fighting near the Russian-occupied site. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, “welcomed recent statements indicating that both Ukraine and Russia supported the [International Atomic Energy Agency’s] aim to send a mission to” the plant, Agence France-Presse reported. The Kremlin said after Putin and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke by phone on Friday that the two leaders had agreed that the IAEA should carry out inspections as soon as possible to “assess the real situation on the ground”. A flare-up in fighting around the Russian-controlled nuclear power station – with both sides blaming each other for attacks – has raised the spectre of a disaster worse than in Chernobyl. The Kremlin said Putin stressed that shelling of the plant “creates the danger of a large-scale catastrophe”. The warning came a day after the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, and the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, met in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and sounded the alarm over the fighting. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, urged the UN to secure the site. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. As it approaches 9.30am in Kyiv, here is a summary of the latest developments on this Saturday 20 August 2022. Vladimir Putin has agreed to inspectors visiting the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. According to the office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Russian leader had “reconsidered the demand” that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through Russia to the site, after Putin himself warned fighting there could bring about a “catastrophe”. The office said Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine. The UN secretary general has asked Russia not take the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant off grid. António Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied facility not be cut off from Ukraine’s electrical grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow was planning to do so, saying the plant used “Ukrainian electricity”. Western officials say there are growing concerns over concerns over water cooling at the Zaporizhzhia plant. Its existing reactor cooling system is critical to the safety of the site and relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation, but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from Ukraine’s grid. More than half of Russia Black Sea naval aviation has been knocked out, according to a western official in Ukraine. The Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out “more than half” of Russia’s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea, western officials have said. However, overall “combat stasis” remains. The US has announced a new $775m (£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine, including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. The US has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment. Russia’s media watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest. Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites – including Google – that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of “false information” about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined the US-based live streaming service Twitch 2 million roubles ($34,000) and messenger service Telegram 11 million roubles for violating military censorship laws. A former Russian mayor has been appointed head of Russian-occupied Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. It is the latest in a string of such appointments, which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory. Ukraine’s economy minister has said the country’s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year. Hit by Russia’s 24 February invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022. The Kyiv Independent reported that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on Kharkiv. The Chinese and Russian leaders, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” he said. As hosts of this year’s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled cities since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting around 15km from the Russian frontline, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/29/uk-offshore-wind-power-renewable-energy-kwasi-kwarteng","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-29T16:25:38Z","webTitle":"UK rules out windfall tax on North Sea oil firms to help fund energy bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/29/uk-offshore-wind-power-renewable-energy-kwasi-kwarteng","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/29/uk-offshore-wind-power-renewable-energy-kwasi-kwarteng","fields":{"headline":"UK rules out windfall tax on North Sea oil firms to help fund energy bills","bodyText":"The business secretary has effectively ruled out a windfall tax on North Sea oil firms to fund discounted energy bills but promised much greater investment in solar panels, wind and nuclear to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas. Speaking amid reports of a cabinet split over landmark energy security plans due to be published within days, Kwasi Kwarteng offered up a tax on oil companies, backed by Labour, as the one policy that definitely will not find favour with ministers. “We believe a windfall tax would be a tax on jobs, would destroy investment and would add to the uncertainty in oil markets,” he said. “It would be completely the wrong message to send investors.” Labour has said the pain inflicted on households by the soaring price of oil and gas could be eased by a tax on the companies that sell it. But Kwarteng has said such a move would penalise anyone with a pension invested in those companies. “It’s a retro measure which completely doesn’t understand what business is all about,” he said. Kwarteng, who was answering questions in the House of Commons on Tuesday, was repeatedly asked if the government had further plans to help households struggling to pay their energy bills. A cap on bills is due to rise by £693 to an average of £1,971 on 1 April, with prices predicted to soar as high as £3,000 at the next price cap increase in October. Kwarteng said “nobody knows” how high prices will go and pointed only to measures announced in chancellor Rishi Sunak’s spring statement, which has been derided for the limitations of its plan to help people cope with the cost-of-living crisis. While the business minister said oil firms would not be hit with a windfall tax, he did unveil a pledge to boost renewable energy sources. The government is aiming to triple the number of solar panels, more than quadruple offshore wind power and double onshore wind and nuclear energy by 2030, in a move that could lower bills for consumers and reduce the UK’s reliance on foreign energy suppliers such as Russia. Kwarteng put forward the targets as part of Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) plans for inclusion in the upcoming energy white paper. The paper has faced delays because the cost of approving at least six nuclear power stations as part of an expansion of the UK’s renewable energy strategy has been debated at the Treasury. Ministers are also divided over plans to back onshore wind. BEIS’s targets include increasing solar power from its current capacity of 14GW to 50GW, offshore wind from 11GW to 50GW, onshore wind from 15GW to 30GW, and nuclear power from 7GW to 16GW, according to the Financial Times. Solar power and onshore wind generation have, to date, not had official government growth targets. Earlier this month, Kwarteng said developing the UK’s energy independence was a matter of national security. Boris Johnson has set out a 10-point plan that includes a target for the UK to get all of its electricity from low-carbon sources by 2035. The expansion of wind and solar farms is likely to be opposed by some residents and campaign groups. Johnson, who has said his personal preference is to expand offshore wind power generation, is considering plans to offer residents affected by the construction of energy farms or nuclear power plants financial incentives to win them over. On Tuesday, SSE, the electricity generator and network company, upgraded its profit forecasts after changes to weather conditions improved output from its renewable energy generation sources. The company – which raised adjusted earnings a share from guidance to between 92p and 97p, up from 90p – also said its thermal and hydro plant benefited from the disruption to oil and gas markets as a result of the war in Ukraine. “SSE’s integrated and balanced business model has performed well in turbulent market conditions,” said the SSE finance director, Gregor Alexander, who added that capital expenditure for the year to the end of March would exceed £2bn. “Our significant investment programme will make a huge contribution towards both net zero and energy security.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/03/russia-has-no-full-control-of-any-of-four-annexed-ukrainian-provinces","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-04T08:53:10Z","webTitle":"Russia no longer has full control of any of four ‘annexed’ Ukrainian provinces","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/03/russia-has-no-full-control-of-any-of-four-annexed-ukrainian-provinces","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/03/russia-has-no-full-control-of-any-of-four-annexed-ukrainian-provinces","fields":{"headline":"Russia no longer has full control of any of four ‘annexed’ Ukrainian provinces","bodyText":"Russia no longer has full control of any of the four provinces of Ukraine it says it annexed last week after Ukrainian troops advanced dozens of kilometres in Kherson province in the south of the country and made additional gains in the east. On Monday, the Russian military acknowledged that Kyiv’s forces had broken through in the Kherson region. It said the Ukrainian army and its “superior tank units” had managed to “penetrate the depths of our defence” around the villages of Zoltaya Balka and Alexsandrovka. The ministry of defence spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Russian troops had occupied what he called a “pre-prepared defensive line”. They continued to “inflict massive fire damage” on Ukrainian forces, he claimed. His comments are an admission that Ukraine’s southern counter-offensive is dramatically gaining pace, two months after it began. Ukrainian brigades appear to have achieved their biggest breakthrough in the region since the war started, bursting through the frontline and advancing rapidly along the Dnieper River. The Ukrainian military’s southern command said forces in the south destroyed 31 Russian tanks and one multiple rocket launcher, without providing details of where the fighting occurred. Russian sources acknowledged that the Ukrainian tank offensive had moved along the river’s west bank, recapturing a number of villages along the way, and threatening the supply lines for thousands of marooned Russian troops. Speaking overnight, Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s 129th brigade from his home city of Kryvyi Rih had liberated the settlements of Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka in the northern Kherson region. The brigade’s soldiers flew a blue and yellow flag in Myrolyubivka from a shell-damaged roof. Russian military bloggers suggested Ukraine’s advance was spectacular. They claimed Kyiv’s troops were close to Dudchany, about 20 miles (30km) south of where the front stood before the breakthrough, indicating one of the fastest advances of the war. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, posted a photo of Ukrainian soldiers posing with their flag draping a golden statue of an angel. He said it was the village of Mikhailivka, about 20km beyond their previous position. The next apparent Ukrainian target was the city of Beryslav, on the banks of the Dnieper. In a sign of turbulence inside Russia’s army command, the head of the western military district was reportedly sacked on Monday in the wake of the recent defeats. The news outlet RBC said Col-Gen Alexander Zhuravlyov had been fired. His district is one of five that make up Russia’s armed forces. The move follows criticism over the weekend by Chechnya’s president, Ramzan Kadyrov, of Valery Gerasimov, Putin’s chief of the general staff, over the loss of Lyman. “This is obviously related to the war blunders, which are becoming harder to hide. The Kremlin is looking for scapegoats,” said a former Russian defence ministry official who has worked with Zhuravlyov. “The pressure on the commander of the Russian armed forces, Valery Gerasimov, will only increase,” the former defence ministry official added. In his latest address, Zelenskiy dismissed as a “farce” Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory, which includes Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk provinces. Declining to mention Vladimir Putin by name, he said “someone somewhere” had recently held what he called “pseudo-referendums”. “When the Ukrainian flag is returned, no one remembers the Russian farce with some pieces of paper,” Zelenskiy said. “Except, of course, the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine. Because everyone who is involved in any elements of aggression against our state will be accountable for it.” On Friday, Putin held a grand signing ceremony in the Kremlin with the four Russian-picked “leaders” of the occupied Ukrainian regions. He declared the territories were Russia’s “for ever” and said he would use “all available means” to defend them – an apparent reference to nuclear weapons. The Russian State Duma – the lower house of parliament – rubber-stamped the move on Monday. But the Kremlin’s strategy quickly unravelled in the face of embarrassing defeats on the battlefield and confusion as to where Russia’s new international “borders” actually were. Over the weekend Ukrainian troops recaptured the city of Lyman in Donetsk oblast – in theory a part of Russia. On Monday, Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, failed to clarify the issue when he said: “We will continue to consult with the people who live in these areas.” This appeared to be a face-saving formula in the event – as seems likely – of further Russian military setbacks in the coming days and weeks. In the eastern Donbas, local separatist leaders acknowledged that Ukraine’s army had crossed the administrative borders of Luhansk province, advancing from Lyman. Russia controls only about a half of Donetsk oblast. It is going backwards, seven months into Putin’s full-scale invasion. In the eastern city of Sloviansk, there was evidence of the recent battles and continuing offensive as captured Russian armour was towed into the city. The fall of Lyman has opened the way for Ukrainian forces to advance deep into Luhansk province, threatening the main supply routes to territory Moscow captured in some of the war’s bloodiest battles in June and July. Observers in Kyiv were cautious on Monday about the scale of Ukrainian gains in the south. They said continuous battles were going on across a flat steppe landscape. Russian troops were using tanks, mortars, and jets to fire at Ukrainian positions and were making extensive use of drones. They were trying to repair bridges across the Dnieper destroyed by Ukrainian missile strikes. The deputy head of Russia’s puppet administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, acknowledged the Ukrainian army was advancing. But he added that “everything is under control”. He recorded a video standing next to a reed-lined riverbank, with Kherson’s Antonivskyi Bridge visible behind him. Stremousov said: “We are on the ground and continue to take care of the citizens of the Russian Federation of the Kherson region. We are now Russia and everything will be fine.” Speaking on Russian TV, his boss, Vladimir Saldo, admitted things were not entirely going to plan. “It’s tense, let’s put it that way,” he said. Saldo took part in Friday’s ceremony in the Kremlin, shaking hands with Putin. On Monday, the Duma rubber-stamped the “annexation treaty”. Zelenskiy’s senior advisers have humorously pointed out the absurdity and surrealism of Russia “annexing” territory, while at the same time losing control of it. Oleksiy Arestovych tweeted on Monday that “more and more settlements” were “rapidly withdrawing from the Russian Federation”. He added: “Now in the Kherson direction.” Russia occupies only about 30% of the Zaporizhzhia region. This includes the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant but not Zaporizhzhia city, the main urban centre. Social media channels suggested Russian troops have recently stopped civilians from leaving via a crossing point to Ukrainian government-run territory, with hundreds of cars stuck. In the north-east of the country, Ukraine was close to liberating all of the Kharkiv region after a counter-offensive which began last month. The Russian frontline is in the east of the oblast not far from the town of Kupiansk and was said to be collapsing. Ukrainian troops liberated several villages including Shyykivka. They were reportedly moving east and along the right-bank of the Oskil River towards the border with Luhansk oblast and the city of Svatove. One unverified report said Russian soldiers had abandoned their positions in a large forest area without a fight, and were fleeing. The International Atomic Energy Agency said Russia had freed the head of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Ihor Murashov disappeared on Friday while on his way to work at the plant, which Russian troops have occupied since March. A Russian patrol abducted him. The Kremlin has been coercing Ukrainian employees to sign new contracts with Rosatom, its state nuclear agency. The IAEA says it had received confirmation Murashov “had returned to his family safely”. Russia still occupies about 15% of Ukraine, including Crimea. But since September the Ukrainians have reclaimed large chunks of land, via twin counter-offensives in the north-east and south. It remains to be seen if Russia’s mass mobilisation at home will change this equation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/05/unproven-small-nuclear-reactors-would-raise-energy-costs-and-delay-renewable-uptake-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-04T16:30:46Z","webTitle":"‘Unproven’ small nuclear reactors would raise Australia’s energy costs and delay renewable uptake, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/05/unproven-small-nuclear-reactors-would-raise-energy-costs-and-delay-renewable-uptake-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/05/unproven-small-nuclear-reactors-would-raise-energy-costs-and-delay-renewable-uptake-report-says","fields":{"headline":"‘Unproven’ small nuclear reactors would raise Australia’s energy costs and delay renewable uptake, report says","bodyText":"The next generation of small nuclear reactors being advocated by the Coalition would raise electricity prices, slow the uptake of renewables and introduce new risks from nuclear waste, according to a report from the Australian Conservation Foundation. But the report from the conservation group has found only two small modular reactors (SMRs) are known to be operating around the world, in Russia and China, and both have seen large cost blowouts. Promoters of nuclear energy, the report claims, were pinning their hopes on technology that was “uncertain and unproven”. “The good news about the renewed nuclear discussion is that it highlights that business as usual with fossil fuels is not an option,” the report found. “The bad news is the very real risk of delay, distraction and a failure to advance a just energy transition”. Last week during question time, the energy minister, Chris Bowen, mocked the Coalition for supporting nuclear and asked which MP would be willing to have a reactor in their electorate. Nuclear energy has been effectively banned in Australia since the late 1990s, but some Coalition senators are pushing for those restrictions to be lifted. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has tasked the shadow climate minister, Ted O’Brien, to review the status of nuclear energy. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In the report Dave Sweeney, ACF’s Nuclear Free campaigner, wrote SMRs would push up electricity costs and introduce unnecessary challenges in managing nuclear waste. “In short, Australia’s energy future is renewable, not radioactive,” he wrote. According to the report, Russia’s floating nuclear plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, has two small SMR units on board. Construction costs had ballooned sixfold. Work started in 2012 on a demonstration plant in China with two gas-cooled reactors that was completed nine years later, costing $8.8bn. “The global SMR reality simply does not come close to matching the Australian SMR rhetoric,” the report says. Three further SMR plants were under construction in Argentina, China and Russia but had been plagued by cost rises and delays, the report said. In June, a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested future deployment of SMRs could increase the amount of nuclear waste by factors of two to 30, depending on the design. In a report last year for the Minerals Council of Australia, the nuclear energy analyst and advocate Ben Heard argued there was a lack of standardised work on the true cost of SMRs. But he said SMRs would hold a “substantial place in a lowest-cost decarbonised economy” and if they were available in Australia they would “widen the road to that decarbonised future”. Heard argued SMRs could operate for more than 40 years delivering zero-carbon electricity. He wrote: “Deploying nuclear power technologies requires a national uplift in competencies and capabilities that a country retains from that point forward. “That journey might be accelerated, particularly for a nation with established capacity like Australia, but it cannot be rushed.” In June the International Energy Agency said SMRs were not yet commercially viable, but “lower cost, smaller size and reduced project risks” could improve social acceptance. There was increased support and interest in Canada, France, UK and the US for the technology, the report said, adding: “But the successful long-term deployment of SMRs hinges on strong support from policymakers starting now, not just to mobilise investment but also to streamline and harmonise regulatory frameworks.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/27/carbon-emissions-to-peak-in-2025-in-historic-turning-point-says-iea","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T07:49:34Z","webTitle":"Carbon emissions from energy to peak in 2025 in ‘historic turning point’, says IEA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/27/carbon-emissions-to-peak-in-2025-in-historic-turning-point-says-iea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/27/carbon-emissions-to-peak-in-2025-in-historic-turning-point-says-iea","fields":{"headline":"Carbon emissions from energy to peak in 2025 in ‘historic turning point’, says IEA","bodyText":"Global carbon emissions from energy will peak in 2025 thanks to massively increased government spending on clean fuels in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to analysis by the world’s leading energy organisation. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said that government spending on clean energy in response to the crisis would mark a “historic turning point” in the transition away from fossil fuels, in its annual report on global energy. The invasion of Ukraine has prompted an energy crisis around the world, with global gas prices initially surging. The crisis has caused steep inflation that has made households poorer around the world. Governments have been scrambling to find other sources of energy. Some analysts have questioned whether fears over energy security could lead to the use of fossil fuels for longer, slowing the world’s race to net zero carbon emissions. Some countries – including the US and the UK under previous prime minister Liz Truss – have pledged to encourage fossil fuel extraction to try to ease prices. However, Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director and one of the world’s most influential energy economists, said the energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion “is in fact going to accelerate the clean energy transition”. The IEA said planned investments in green energy in response to the crisis meant that – for the first time – government policies would lead to demand for polluting fossil fuels peaking this decade. The agency cited notable contributions from the US Inflation Reduction Act, the EU’s emissions reduction package, and actions by Japan, South Korea, China and India. Under the new plans investment in low-carbon energy such as solar, wind and nuclear power will rise to $2tn (£1.7tn) a year by 2030, an increase of more than 50% from today. However, annual clean energy investment would have to reach $4tn by 2030 to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a figure that illustrates the scale of the challenge facing governments around the world. The IEA analysis showed that current government policies would still lead to global temperatures rising by 2.5C, which would have catastrophic climate impacts. That would be far above the target of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The 1.5C target, agreed at the Paris climate conference, would prevent the worst effects of climate breakdown. The analysis adds to a consensus among scientists that governments are not doing enough to prevent climate disaster. A separate UN study, published on Wednesday, also found that government pledges so far to cut emissions will lead to 2.5C of heating. The wave of clean energy investment will also cost Russia $1tn in lost fossil fuel revenues by 2030 compared with before the invasion, Birol said. Russia, previously the world’s largest exporter of fossil fuels, would have a “much diminished role in international energy affairs” as the world’s reliance on burning methane gas for power falls, he added. “The golden age of gas is approaching the end,” Birol said. Birol said the crisis had not changed the IEA’s assessment, first published last year, that all new fossil fuel projects should stop immediately in order for the world to hit net zero emissions by 2050. New oil and gas extraction projects “will jeopardise our climate goals”, he said. He also dismissed criticism from some climate deniers that spending on clean energy had contributed to higher energy prices, saying that argument was “hiding who sparked the energy crisis, which is Russia”. The IEA found that higher shares of renewable energy were correlated with lower electricity prices. “None of the government leaders complained about too much clean energy,” Birol said. “They complain that they don’t have enough clean energy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/oct/26/the-climate-book-by-greta-thunberg-review-global-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-26T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"The Climate Book by Greta Thunberg review – global warning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/26/the-climate-book-by-greta-thunberg-review-global-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/oct/26/the-climate-book-by-greta-thunberg-review-global-warning","fields":{"headline":"The Climate Book by Greta Thunberg review – global warning","bodyText":"We are supposed to have solved this problem in just under 30 years. That’s the same amount of time that has elapsed since Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner smooched in The Bodyguard. Governments’ commitment to limit global heating to 1.5C above the preindustrial average means the huge transition to net zero will have to be made by 2050. By then, renewables should be producing most of our energy – certainly all the electricity in rich countries – and we should all be driving around in electric cars, eating sustainable, mainly plant-based foods and living in well-insulated houses built from low-carbon materials. The many books written about how to avoid the climate crisis will hopefully have become obsolete. Which of them will survive to be read beyond the combustion era, if only by historians – as testament to this period of crisis and uncertainty? Well, Greta Thunberg is already assured her place in history as the Jeanne d’Arc (or Cassandra) of our time. She’s been heroically battling the forces of climate inaction and denial since she stepped on to the global stage as a shy 15-year-old schoolkid “striking for the climate”. Anything written or orchestrated by her – like this appealingly produced anthology of essays – stands an excellent chance. Thunberg herself writes with the stark conviction of youth and an activist’s directness, which is both refreshing to read and tiring. Fortunately, space is given to writers who weave messages with skill and beauty, like Peter Brannen, who takes the chemistry of the carbon cycle and presents it as the marvellous life force it is. Warning us where we’re heading, he evokes an episode of global warming from Earth’s history: “In the aftermath, when the fever finally broke, one could travel the world without seeing a tree, the world’s coral reefs had been replaced by bacterial slime, the fossil record went silent and the planet took nearly 10 million years to pull itself back from oblivion.” Naomi Oreskes writes fiercely about “the history of denial and obfuscation by the fossil fuel industry”, and there are stirring contributions from the climate scientist Kate Marvel and the novelist Amitav Ghosh. This is a campaigning book of course, but much more than that. There are clear explanations of how human activities are pushing Earth’s systems close to dangerous tipping points, and of the socioeconomic drivers of the crisis. We are told throughout that if we don’t limit global temperature rises to 1.5C, we face disaster, yet planned fossil fuel production by 2030 will be more than twice the amount consistent with this target. In short, we are very unlikely to meet our transition target by 2050. What then? In a book of more than 400 pages, just one and a half are given over to technologies aimed at reducing global heating by reflecting sunlight back into space. That particular essay can be summed up in a quote: “Geoengineering is not an option.” The idea of withdrawing emitted carbon from the atmosphere gets a little more (reluctant) attention, because “we’ve left Greta’s generation little choice”. Nuclear power is barely mentioned even though decarbonising energy systems is fundamental to this effort. For all Thunberg’s brilliance and bravery, ignoring these possibilities feel timorous and blinkered. This book is superb at explaining the urgency and importance of preventing climate change, but despite its heft it stops too soon. There is little pragmatism over what to do about now-certain changes, which means it feels like a book whose time was 10 years ago. But perhaps it has taken this decade for an audience that’s receptive to its message to develop. History will show. • The Climate Book by Greta Thunberg is published by Allen Lane (£25).

Jana Kalaaji, a Syrian-Lebanese student who has been at the city’s university for a year, said: “There’s no electricity now. There is no water. There is no tapwater. There are no supplies. There is no heat because the heat comes with electricity.” “Today I went to different markets in different places: one in the centre, one close to me, and one far from me. All of them are closed. I don’t think there’s supplies any more for the citizens here,” Kalaaji said. “No one understand the situation here because it’s crazy. One student interviewed by Indian TV on Friday begged for immediate help, and confirmed they were running out of food and water. “Please take some immediate action or else we will die for sure,” she said. Earlier this week, it emerged that 500 foreign students were stuck in the city, including almost 400 Nigerians, three Irish students and pupils from Rwanda, Lebanon and Tanzania. Indian media are reporting that there are between 700 and 1,000 more. Aashik Hussain Sarkar, an Indian medical student, said they witnessed a massive bomb in Friday: “Please evacuate us immediately. More than 1,000 Indians are waiting.” One student told the Indian network NDTV they had been waiting on the street for buses to take them to the border when a loud explosion occurred and they rushed to the bunker under their student apartment block. Sumy was still under Ukrainian control, according to the students. A student said: “Right now there is no electricity. There is shortage of water. When we heard that bombardment sound, we just took our passport and we ran into the bunkers. We were really so scared. This time the noise was really really extreme. “We were waiting for a military pass to the border for one-and-a-half hours and at this last moment we heard this noise and we were shifted in here. Now the current situation is the Ukrainian government is now allowing us to travel to the border.” “The explosion was really huge because we felt this in the bunker,” her friend said. The Indian students were all in a single apartment building in Sumy and were reliant on small deliveries of food and water from a local church, said Chandramohan Nallur, an Indian volunteer at the Polish border, helping students stuck in the country. “Luckily I found a contact who used to live in Lviv. They are arranging some food and water through a church,” he said. “There are about 700 in one building. Shelling is still going on; there’s a lot of panic.” Another student said their hopes of rescue were dying, with armed men seen outside their hostel making it unsafe to go out. All public transport out of the town has been cancelled and going the 25-mile (40km) distance to the Russian border is impossible. Christiana Diyaolu, from Carlow in Ireland, whose 19-year-old sister Racheal is trapped, told RTÉ that a journey to the southern or western border would take 20 hours and would be unviable because of bombs, gunfire and shelling. “This is the first time my sister has been away from home since she was born. We just want her to come home,” she said. Oluwaseun Adefemi, a Nigerian medical student, and three others told how they managed to escape from Sumy on Thursday in a private vehicle. But they said it was a dangerous journey out of the city, where they heard blasts, and passed damaged military equipment and soldiers conducting a burial. Kalaaji said she was aware of some students having escaped by car as far as the Ukrainian town of Poltava. “I don’t know if I will do the same. It may just have been luck [that the other students escaped,” she said. “None of the students here are waiting or expecting anything from the government any more”. Nigeria’s government said on Thursday it was advocating for a safe corridor by which 368 students who were stuck in Sumy could leave. The Indian government said 3,000 students had already been evacuated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/nato-chief-warns-of-worse-suffering-in-ukraine-and-russian-attacks-elsewhere","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T15:34:59Z","webTitle":"Russia steps up onslaught after Ukraine ‘narrowly’ escapes nuclear disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/nato-chief-warns-of-worse-suffering-in-ukraine-and-russian-attacks-elsewhere","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/nato-chief-warns-of-worse-suffering-in-ukraine-and-russian-attacks-elsewhere","fields":{"headline":"Russia steps up onslaught after Ukraine ‘narrowly’ escapes nuclear disaster","bodyText":"The US envoy to the UN said the world had narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe in Russia’s attack on Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, as Moscow’s forces intensified their devastating campaign of artillery and airstrikes against civilian areas of Ukraine. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, speaking at an emergency meeting of the UN security council in New York on Friday, the US envoy said Russia’s actions, which caused a major fire at the Zaporizhzhia compound, reflected a “dangerous new escalation” in its invasion of Ukraine. “Russia’s attack last night put Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at grave risk,” she said. “It was incredibly reckless and dangerous. And it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe.” Meanwhile, Ukraine’s president issued a rebuke to Nato which earlier refused to impose a no-fly zone, over concerns that doing so could cause the war to escalate across Europe. In a furious late night speech, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity. “The alliance has given the green light to the bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages by refusing to create a no-fly zone.” At a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance could not directly engage with Russian forces. “The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send Nato fighter planes into Ukraine’s airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,” Stoltenberg said. Western leaders expressed outrage at the incident at Zaporizhzhia, with the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, describing Putin’s actions as “now directly threatening the safety of all of Europe” and the US president, Joe Biden, condemning Moscow for the shelling, which Russia claimed was a “monstrous provocation” by Ukrainian saboteurs. The US embassy in Kyiv called the attack a “war crime” in a post on Twitter but the US state department reportedly distanced itself from the allegation, instructing its other embassies not to retweet the claim. The fire, at a training centre on the site’s perimeter, was extinguished on Friday and officials said radiation was normal. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said the reactors were undamaged but the situation “naturally continues to be extremely tense and challenging”. Russian forces seized the plant after heavy fighting. Russian ground forces in the south of Ukraine made an assault on the shipbuilding centre of Mykolaiv as they began their long-expected push west towards the key port of Odesa. Kyiv came under fresh heavy attack and local authorities in the northern city of Chernihiv raised the death toll from a missile strike on residential buildings on Thursday to 47. In Russia, reporting of the war by international and local independent media was put under increasing pressure as the lower house of parliament passed a law punishing the intentional spreading of “fake” news about the military with 15 years in jail. The BBC announced it was suspending all operations in the country and the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, edited by the Nobel peace prize winner Dmitry Muratov, said it would be removing content on Ukraine. Access to Facebook and Twitter was also completely blocked in retaliation for the social media platforms’ restrictions on state-backed media. At the Nato foreign ministers’s meeting Stoltenberg, described the Russian invasion of Ukraine as “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades … with cities under siege, schools, hospitals, and residential buildings shelled”. In a sobering assessment of the military situation, he told reporters there was evidence of the use of cluster bombs and “other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law”, adding: “The days to come are likely to be worse.” He warned that there was also a growing risk of the war spreading to Georgia, on whose territory Vladimir Putin’s troops are already present, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, where Bosnian Serbs have been threatening to break up the state with the Kremlin’s support. The UN human rights office said it had confirmed 331 civilians, including 19 children, had been killed and 675 injured since the invasion began on 24 February, adding that the real toll would be much higher. Most were killed by explosive weapons such as shelling from heavy artillery, multi-launch rocket systems, missiles and airstrikes. The UN refugee and children’s agencies said more than 1.2 million people had fled the country, including about half of a million children. The UNCHR spokesperson Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams described the rate as “phenomenal”, adding that an equal number were probably displaced inside Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said the EU was working with NGOs in Ukraine to establish “humanitarian corridors”, after agreement between Kyiv and representatives from the Kremlin on Thursday. “Humanitarian aid must be able to reach all parts of Ukraine and civilians must be allowed to escape cities under siege,” she said. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said in Brussels that the west was “faced with what is President Putin’s war of choice: unprovoked, unjustified, and a war that is having horrific, horrific consequences for real people. For mothers, fathers. For children. We see the images on TV, and it has to stop.” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who had joined the meeting in Brussels by video link, showed Blinken and EU foreign ministers photographs of the carnage being wrought. “One of which I think has also been in the media shows a father grieving over his dead child,” Blinken said. “Blood is still on the sheet, the drapes, it’s a reminder that even as we talk about these weighty issues of war and peace, what this is really about is the lives of men, women, children, hundreds, thousands of individual human tragedies inflicted by Vladimir Putin and his war of choice on Ukraine and its people and we can’t lose sight of that fact.” Putin, however, dismissed reports of airstrikes on Kyiv and other large Ukrainian cities as “gross propaganda fakes” in a phone call with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the Kremlin said. The Russian president “confirmed Russia is open to dialogue” with Ukraine but only “on condition all Russian demands are met”, it said. Those demands included neutral and non-nuclear status for Ukraine and its “denazification”, the recognition of Crimea as part of Russia and of the “sovereignty” of separatist territories in eastern Ukraine, Moscow said. Putin told Scholz he hoped “Kyiv will take a reasonable and constructive position” in a third round of talks planned for next week, the Kremlin statement added. Putin separately warned Russia’s neighbours on Friday “not to escalate the situation” by imposing more restrictions on his country. As Russian forces stepped up their assault on cities particularly in the south and east of Ukraine, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country had “survived a night that could have stopped the story, the history of Ukraine, the history of Europe”. A day after Moscow’s forces took control of the strategically important city of Kherson, the invading troops continued to besiege population centres, particularly in southern Ukraine, pounding them with artillery and airstrikes and causing devastating damage. The governor of Mykolaiv said Russian troops had entered his city of about 500,000 people, although a presidential adviser later said the advance had been halted. The south-eastern port city of Mariupol is also encircled by Russian forces and heavily bombarded, but remains under Ukrainian control. The city’s deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said its humanitarian situation was “terrible” after 40 hours of continuous shelling including on schools and hospitals. “I believe that he wants to destroy Ukraine as a nation, and Mariupol is on this way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/russia-ukraine-how-the-west-woke-up-to-vladimir-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T14:12:20Z","webTitle":"The week where decades happened: how the west finally woke up to Putin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-ukraine-how-the-west-woke-up-to-vladimir-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-ukraine-how-the-west-woke-up-to-vladimir-putin","fields":{"headline":"The week where decades happened: how the west finally woke up to Putin","bodyText":"Lenin, a Russian leader as obsessed with history as Vladimir Putin, famously said: “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.” This has been the latter. The little more than a week since Russian troops invaded Ukraine has indeed shaken the world. Change has been telescoped, national taboos broken, moribund institutions given purpose and the spectre of a nuclear war in Europe has been raised for the first time since the 1980s. Germany has called it Zeitenwende, the turning point. It will not just be Ukraine that is changed for ever by this war. But there is something specific about how war accelerates change. In The Deluge, his classic work on how society is changed by war, the British historian Arthur Marwick wrote: “War acts as a supreme challenge to, and test of, a country’s social and political institutions. War results not only in the destruction of inefficient institutions (such as the Tsarist regime in Russia), but also in the transformation of less efficient mechanisms into more efficient ones”. The west has surprised itself with its ability to respond to the misery inflicted on the people of Ukraine. All kinds of unimaginable images emerge. The German Bundestag cheered an extra €100bn (£82.4bn) on defence spending, followed by 100,000 people on the streets in protest at Putin. Matteo Salvini, the great Italian defender of Putin, bringing white tulips to the Ukrainian embassy. Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, attending a meeting of the EU foreign affairs ministers meeting. The Hungarian leader, Viktor Orbán, sharply criticised by human-rights groups and others over the years for his hardline border policies, sitting on a school bench opening his arms to refugees. It was just a fortnight ago that the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, had appeared at the Munich security conference to caution the crisis was not the moment to try to execute an 180-degree turn on the decades-old German policy banning the sale of arms into conflict zones. Josep Borrell, the EU external affairs chief, batted away calls for Ukraine to join the EU, saying they already had an exceptional trade deal. He spoke about the “power of the EU’s language”, distancing himself from his own one-time claim that the EU must learn “the language of power”. The next day – Sunday – all the talk was of Emmanuel Macron’s diplomatic initiative, and the concessions the French president had extracted from Vladimir Putin. Even on Wednesday, on the eve of the invasion, Baerbock gave an interview saying it was impossible for Germany to impose the strongest sanctions because of “the massive collateral damage” to Germany’s own economy. Putin could end up laughing at us, she warned. Yet by the following weekend, two days after the invasion began on Thursday, Germany’s coalition government had started that 180-degree course correction. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his cabinet agreed to send Ukraine 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 anti-aircraft Stinger missiles, lifting restrictions on German weapons being sent to conflict zones by third parties in the process. The next day, Scholz told the Bundestag in his trademark matter-of-fact manner that he was injecting €100bn into German defence, but protecting other budgets, and defence spending would rise above 2% of German GDP. The MPs from government and the CDU gasped and cheered in equal measure. David McAllister, a leading figure in the German CDU and chair of the European parliament’s foreign affairs select committee, admits he nearly fell off his chair when he heard the plans. The promised growth catapults Germany into becoming the third largest spender on defence globally, behind only the US and China. GlobalData forecasts an annual German defence budget of $83.5bn in 2024, equating to a 45% increase on 2021’s budget of $57.5bn. That is bigger than France and the UK. Overnight Germany became not just an economic but also a geopolitical powerhouse. Polls said 78% of Germans backed the decision. Matthias Matthijs, Europe senior fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “It is quite astonishing how fast this government broke pretty well every taboo in postwar German foreign policy.” He attributes the scale of the change to a visit to Berlin on Sunday by the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. “I came to Berlin to shake the conscience of Germany,” Morawiecki said. Sophia Besch, from the Centre for European Reform, points out Scholz himself insisted he had not acted due to pressure from allies, but due to Germany changing its view of the threat posed by Putin. “The truth is the world did not change last Thursday,” she said. “Berlin for years has ignored the warnings that came from many of our allies and from Putin. We need to learn the lessons of how this could have happened and how we could have been so blind. We are leaving behind some of our old beliefs – that economic interdependence prevents conflict, but I am not sure we know yet with what we are replacing this belief.” Sergey Lagodinsky, a German Green MEP, argued Germany needs not only to spend more money, but to shift its mindset without becoming militaristic or interventionist. It needs to discuss how to adopt escalation, including military escalation, as leverage as part of its foreign policy toolbox. Foreign policy is not just a peace policy, Friedenspolitik in German, but also the ability to deal, manage and face conflict. But the new German coalition, faced by the need to extricate itself from Russian energy, may have to challenge other orthodoxies. The Green economics minister, Robert Habeck, does not rule out extending the use of coal-fired power plants. “This blind, naive, one-sided relationship of dependency on Russia for energy for decades is one of the biggest strategic mistakes of the past 20 years,” Lagodinsky said. “Now we are stuck. It represents a medium- and long-term problem”. But Putin’s recklessness is not just causing a revolution in Germany, but across Europe. Sweden abandoned its policy of not sending weapons to conflict zones, agreeing to send Bofors AT-4, a single-use anti-tank launcher, to Ukraine, plus medical supplies. In Finland, a bombshell poll showed 53% want Finland to join Nato. “This poll flipped everything on its head,” said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. Moreover the poll showed that if voters were told that politicians said they backed the plan the support went up to two-thirds. “You could sense the president, Sauli Niinisto, realised the whole defence dynamic was changed.” Niinisto, seen as one of the best readers of what Putin is thinking is now rushing to hold urgent talks with Joe Biden in the White House. Even in Switzerland, leaders had to catch up with the public mood in the space of a weekend, and by the Monday an emergency cabinet promised to implement the entire EU sanctions package. The decision does not formally end a policy of neutrality that has survived two world wars, but there is now pressure to track down the many oligarchs that live in the country. There are also calls for an increase in the defence budget There has been a mini-revolution in Italy, too, where the prime minister, Mario Draghi, accused last week of seeking sanctions carve-outs to protect Italy’s dependence on Russian gas, has also found some mettle. He told parliament on Tuesday: “Yes, we want peace, but it is obvious that whoever amassed more than 60km of tanks near Kyiv does not want peace. We cannot turn our backs on Ukraine. Italy does not intend to look away.” He proposed an international public register of those with assets of more than €10m. In France, Macron looks likely to be re-elected comfortably next month as the rightwing candidates find themselves compromised by links to Putin they cannot deny. Eastern European countries, sometimes hostile to refugees, have instead had the most open arms. Poland has taken an unprecedented 600,000 people. Orbán the Hungarian leader photographed smiling at child refugees, vows “No one will be left uncared for.” The UK too has been experiencing unusually heavy traffic on the Road to Damascus. The Conservative government promises there will be no hiding place for oligarchs, publishing the delayed economic crime bill and seemingly unnerving Roman Abramovich into selling his stake in Chelsea football club. The endless denigration of Brussels has stopped. “The quality and intensity of the contacts between the EU and UK has been different to anything since before Brexit,” one EU official said. “We have restored a level of trust”. But it has been at the level of the European Union that the action has been quickest and most surprising, revealing Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU Commission and former German defence minister, as a powerful advocate for action. For the EU to release €500m from the European Peace Facility to provide equipment and supplies to the Ukrainian armed forces, including - for the first time – lethal equipment, was a first. EU military staff based in Poland are now coordinating military supplies into Ukraine. The EU as a military player is no longer just the stuff of seminars. Equally, the Commission in discussing its EU sanctions package acted with an unparalleled speed, and by consensus among the member states. Some EU sanctions packages take months to be agreed as one country or other exploiting the requirement for unanimity uses their veto power to pursue a national interest. That the UK, US and EU were able to coordinate an attack on the Russian central bank, freezing out some Russian banks from the global Swift bank payment system and implementing measures to prevent Russian banks and firms raising capital, showed a wholly unexpected level of resolve. This was a financial declaration of war – an attempt to turn Russia into a pariah economy – something never tried before, using methods never deployed before. It involved, for instance, some G20 central banks freezing the Russian central bank reserves held in their own jurisdiction, so depleting the war chest of reserves that Putin had accumulated to defend his economy if it came under western attack. All this is remarkable, indeed epoch-making, but not a cause for celebration. The institutions of liberal democracy may have belatedly shown resolve and unity, but in the here and now they are still losing. Keir Giles, from the Chatham House thinktank, is blunt: “Russia will want to present Zelenskiy with an appalling choice – whether to fight on at immense human cost and to the destruction of his country, infrastructure and economy or to submit to his terms in order that life can go on. “The decision to abandon Ukraine to that fate was made by the west when it gave the green light to Putin by reassuring him that no one would intervene. Nato does not have a strategy to win the war in Ukraine because Nato does not want to be in the war in Ukraine.” European politicians will also be worrying as the price of bread and energy soars in the months ahead whether voters are willing to make the sacrifice. the Lithuanian foreign minister told the UK foreign affairs select committee that half-measures would not do. “Putin has no boundaries to what instruments he is going to use and unleash against the Ukrainians”, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said, adding the west “had to go all-in”. He wants humanitarian corridors supported by no-fly zones. But the UK and the US have firmly rejected this since it would pit Nato pilots against Russian pilots. A Polish plan, backed by Borrell for Nato to provide Ukraine with Nato jets, training and bombs, got shot down in less than a day. The other remaining option is to end the final carve-outs in the sanctions regime. “The push is now for carpet sanctions to match the carpet bombing,” said Orysia Lutsevych from the Ukraine Forum, adding the UK, EU and the US are still buying more than €700m of oil, gas and other commodities that is the equivalent of 150 tanks a day that Russia can finance. That could be stopped either through an energy trade embargo, or by reversing the EU decision to let Gazprombank and Sberbank, the vehicles through which Europe pays for Russian oil and gas, stay in the Swift payment system. UK officials briefed on Wednesday they want to abolish the carve out given by the EU. If these two banks are thrown out of Swift that might immobilise Russian oil and gas exports, or lead to unspecified retaliation by Putin. The breadth and range of economic and financial measures taken against Moscow, not to mention growing sporting and cultural isolation, has been a humiliation for Putin, but it is also a risk for the west if the Russian leader sees no answer but total victory. “He is in a corner, but unfortunately with nuclear weapons, says Giles. The west has been transformed in a week, but the question this weekend is if it would be willing, forced by the chaos of events, to go even further. The charge facing the west after a week of war is the one made by George Orwell of Neville Chamberlain in 1938. Like almost everyone at the time, he “neither wanted to pay the price of peace nor that of war”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/04/pork-prices-likely-to-rise-due-to-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-says-defra-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T12:48:47Z","webTitle":"UK pork prices likely to rise due to Russia-Ukraine conflict, says minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/04/pork-prices-likely-to-rise-due-to-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-says-defra-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/04/pork-prices-likely-to-rise-due-to-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-says-defra-minister","fields":{"headline":"UK pork prices likely to rise due to Russia-Ukraine conflict, says minister","bodyText":"The price of food including pork is likely to rise significantly as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a UK environment minister has warned. Victoria Prentis, the Defra minister responsible for farming, also suggested Britons may want to stop buying Russian white fish, which makes up about a third of the volume consumed in the UK. Prentis warned that British people would have to become more willing to pay premium prices for quality food produced domestically. Speaking at the launch of the Conservative Environment Network’s Green Albion essay collection, she said: “I’ve been having really important meetings with the fishing industry. Thirty per cent of our white fish, for example, is imported from Russia. Get real, guys.” The minister told the Guardian further sanctions were being considered that could affect the fishing industry, but suggested consumers boycott the Russian fish. She said: “For now, do we really want to be buying Russian fish?” Prior to the invasion, Prentis had been mostly focused on the cost of living crisis as well as the shift to more environmentally friendly farming, implementing the environmental land management schemes (Elms) which would have farmers paid subsidies for improving biodiversity and nature on their land. However, she has found herself dealing with potential supply-chain failures as a result of the war. “I am going to dial down the optimism because we are in the middle of the most extraordinary series of world events,” she said. As an example of how the events in Europe could drive up prices, the minister said: “I’ve been talking to the pig industry – a very, very difficult supply chain at all levels – are we prepared to buy more British high-welfare pigs? We will have to pay more.” She said that while environmental policies were still a priority, “we need to make sure that the policy we’re making at every stage is correct to the stage we’re in. And frankly the stage for this week is completely different from the stage we were in last week.” There are fears of a wheat crisis on the continent, as Russia and Ukraine account for 14% of global wheat production, ranking first and fifth, respectively. The countries together account for nearly 30% of global wheat exports. Prentis has been meeting her counterparts in Europe to discuss this. She said: “I am so grateful that in this country we grow 88% of the wheat we eat. I met the Albanian foreign minister earlier this week, who imports 44% of her wheat – in a very poor country – from Ukraine. We are in a very fortunate position in many ways.” Another battle Prentis has been fighting is with her Conservative colleagues who have criticised the Elms scheme. Some of her critics argue that farmers should be given more subsidies for producing food rather than solely for environmental goods. The Conservative MP Neil Parish, who chairs the environment select committee, recently said: “There is an issue of food security, because Ukraine is the breadbasket of the world, as is the western part of Russia: I have visited Bryansk in the past and I remember that the one thing I wanted to bring home with me was the soil. I have never seen such beautiful soil in my life. It can grow absolutely everything. “As we change agricultural policy, we need to protect the environment but we need food. There is not enough food in the Agriculture Act.” Prentis said of her critics: “I really feel that we’ve got to stop viewing ourselves as environmentalists or farmers and there being any sort of boundary between the two. “Quite frankly, it really pisses me off that so many of us are onboard with this programme and we are going in one direction but that we are having these ridiculous arguments about which bit [of funding] goes where in the programme.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-301-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-21T17:34:46Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 301 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-301-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-301-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 301 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has confirmed he is on his way to the US, his first foreign trip since the war broke out 300 days ago. The US president, Joe Biden, released a statement saying that Zelenskiy will go to the White House on Wednesday before addressing a joint session of Congress “demonstrating the strong, bipartisan support for Ukraine”. A senior US administration official denied that Biden will pressure Zelenskiy to seek a diplomatic end to the war. Zelenskiy’s visit to the US is “extremely significant” and will disprove Russian attempts to show that US-Ukrainian relations are “cooling”, Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. The Ukrainian president’s trip and meeting with his US counterpart will provide an opportunity to explain the real situation in Ukraine, what weapons Kyiv needs to fight Moscow, and why it needs them, Podolyak told Reuters. The Kremlin has said nothing good will come of Zelenskiy’s trip to Washington and that Russia sees no chance of peace talks with Kyiv. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that continued western arms supplies to Ukraine would lead to a “deepening” of the conflict – something that could backfire on Kyiv, he warned. Air raid alerts were heard across all parts of Ukraine on Wednesday, according to local officials. There was no immediate word of a new wave of Russian attacks. Vladimir Putin has vowed that Russia will fulfil all the goals of what Moscow calls its “military campaign” in Ukraine in an end-of-year meeting of his top defence officials. In his speech, where he laid his country’s military plans to defence chiefs in Moscow, Putin said he will ensure that Russia’s nuclear forces are combat-ready and that there were no financial limits on what the government would provide its military. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has called for his country’s military to be expanded from its current 1 million servicemen to 1.5 million amid the fighting in Ukraine. Speaking at an end-of-year conference with Russia’s military chiefs and Putin, also proposed raising the age range for mandatory Russian military service to cover Russian citizens aged 21-30. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has undertaken a surprise trip to Beijing and held talks with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during which he said they discussed the Ukraine conflict. Medvedev, now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said he and Xi had discussed the two countries’ “no limits” strategic partnership, as well as Ukraine. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, will visit Russia on Thursday for discussions on the creation of a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, the Russian state-owned RIA Novosti news agency reported, citing Russia’s envoy to the international institutions in Vienna. President Zelenskiy visited the frontline city of Bakhmut on Tuesday. He met military representatives and handed out awards to soldiers, his office has said. A blast ripped through the Urengoi-Pomary-Uzhhorod gas exporting pipeline that leads from Russia through Ukraine. Reuters reported that three people died in the incident. Ukraine was warned to prepare for new Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. Prime minister Denys Shmyhal said Moscow wanted Ukraine to spend Christmas and new year in darkness. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said the situation in four areas of eastern Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – that Moscow illegally annexed in September, was “extremely difficult”. Russia’s illegal annexation of the four territories, which together make up 15% of Ukraine, marked the largest forcible takeover of territory in Europe since the second world war and was condemned by Kyiv and its western allies as illegal. Russia has suffered acute setbacks in the areas, halting its ambitions. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, on Tuesday condemned Iran’s support for Russia in its war in Ukraine and the ongoing repression of opposition in the country, but said the EU would continue to work with Iran on restoring the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. “Necessary meeting with Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in Jordan amid deteriorating Iran-EU relations,” Borrell tweeted ahead of a regional conference being hosted by Jordan. Ukraine is accelerating efforts to erase the vestiges of Soviet and Russian influence from its public spaces by pulling down monuments and renaming hundreds of streets to honour its own artists, poets, soldiers, independence leaders and others – including heroes of this year’s war. Since the war began, Ukraine’s leaders have shifted a campaign that once focused on dismantling its communist past into one of “de-Russification”. China says Chinese-Russian naval drills beginning on Wednesday aim to “further deepen” cooperation between the two countries whose unofficial anti-western alliance has gained strength since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The drills will be held off the coast of Zhejiang province south of Shanghai until next Tuesday, according to a brief notice posted Monday by China’s eastern theatre command under the ruling Communist party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/30/australia-finally-has-a-policy-that-will-cut-emissions-and-thats-a-cold-hard-fact","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-30T01:23:44Z","webTitle":"A climate policy that actually cuts emissions?

It’s the reality that fossil fuel bosses and News Corp commentators can’t see","bodyText":"At some stage, policies that governments put forward to reduce emissions need to do exactly what they say on the tin. This week’s deal between Labor and the Greens to improve a policy covering Australia’s biggest polluters does, finally, achieve that. The details are complicated (we’ll get into them in just a little bit) but the changes to the safeguard mechanism take the country a step closer to the goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 – though there is still far more to do. These are goals that consecutive Australian governments have signed up to. Yet much of the coverage and commentary around this week’s deal, particularly in conservative media, ignores this simple fact. The Australian newspaper was the conduit for many of the fossil fuel industry’s protests that the policy would “force up power prices and put domestic gas supply at risk” according to one story, and “destroy jobs and kill foreign investment” in the coal industry, according to another. In the Daily Telegraph, a story claimed the changes to the safeguard mechanism would risk $96bn of energy projects and these should be seen as “coal-hard facts”. Significant portions of the fossil fuel industry appear unable to accept the cold-hard realities of atmospheric physics, the community’s demand for action, the decarbonising trajectory of global energy supplies and Australia’s obligations under global agreements that are all lining up to say the same thing on the policy tin. And that tin says: “Stop releasing greenhouse gases.” First, a quick reminder of what’s happened. The safeguard mechanism is a key plank of the Labor government’s pledge to cut emissions by 43% by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2050. The scheme covers about one-third of Australia’s current emissions. Any project that emits at least 100,000 tonnes of CO2 in a year (electricity generators are excluded) is included, and there are a lot of coalmines and gas projects on the list, alongside refineries, smelters and other mining operations. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The government’s deal with the Greens ensures that gross emissions under the mechanism will be effectively capped at 140m tonnes of CO2-equivalent and then decline. Emissions covered by the scheme cannot go up. In some ways, the safeguard mechanism is a downsized domestic version of the broader global challenge of emissions reduction. For Australia’s – and the world’s – big emitters, the safeguard mechanism presents two very simple options. Either companies find ways to make a profit that don’t involve liberating billions of tonnes of ancient fossil carbon, or they find ways to stop the greenhouse gases from their projects being released into the atmosphere. If companies and their industry lobby groups were serious about their public support for keeping global temperatures to 1.5C, then there is no third option that allows emissions to keep climbing with the victims of the climate crisis sacrificed on the altar of jobs and growth. That’s a point entirely missing from much of the commentary this week, particularly from conservative media and the fossil fuel industry. Within this, companies will still be able to use carbon offsets to meet some of their targets says Tennant Reed, director of climate energy at the Australian Industry Group. “But [the safeguard mechanism amendments] does make clear that overall covered emissions do have to fall over time, even before taking account of offsets. That should not be particularly controversial,” he said. Reed makes the point that demand for coal and gas exports will probably play a much bigger role in the fate of those sectors than the design of a domestic policy. All of Australia’s trading partners have commitments to reach net zero over the coming decades, Reed says, so “it is hard to escape the conclusion that falling demand will eventually see exports shrink dramatically.” “That will be a painful transition, and one over which Australia has no veto. The small consolation prize for the coal and gas sectors would be that such customer decisions would make it much easier for them to comply with the safeguard.” Demonisation? One Australian coal boss told the Australian the changes to the safeguard mechanism were built on a political objective to push a “base demonisation of fossil fuels” that would threaten Australia’s role as a “reliable energy exporter” for the region. Actually, Australia is a “reliable” exporter of fossil fuels that are helping drive up global greenhouse gas emissions, worsening the already pernicious affects of climate change that include, but are not limited to, longer and more intense heatwaves, increased risk of flooding, rising sea levels (that will threaten many coastal cities around the world), ecosystem collapse, ocean acidification, longer and more intense bushfires and droughts and ever more extreme weather events. The “demonisation of fossil fuels” – if you want to call it that – comes from basic atmospheric physics and decades of scientific endeavour now confirmed by real-world events. As much as some might like to paint that as politics, it shouldn’t be. ‘In a frenzy’ Former editor of the Australian Chris Mitchell wrote in a column in that newspaper that environment journalists and the “left media” were “in a frenzy” over the most recent release from the UN’s climate panel. They were missing elephants in the room, he wrote, one of which was “the failure of a climate catastrophe, or anything like it, to arrive”. “Sorry what … where has he been?,” asked an incredulous associate professor Sara Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at UNSW Canberra and expert on extreme weather events. “Has he not seen the floods or the heatwaves or the bushfires? I don’t know what he’s looking for, but a climate catastrophe won’t happen everywhere to everyone all at the same time. “But we’re seeing again and again and again extreme events that impact people all around the world and at different times. Those impacts are getting broader, they’re costing us more and they’re taking more lives.” Mitchell appeared to want to present himself as a pragmatic realist, claiming the world could not – and would not – do without fossil fuels (which is a much easier position to take if you don’t accept the evidence of their damage to begin with). Mitchell decided to quote a US-based oil company executive, who had written on LinkedIn that in “all International Energy Agency scenarios” of future energy use, oil consumption rises and natural gas consumption continues to grow. “None of this should be a surprise to environment writers. Most just don’t report inconvenient facts,” writes Mitchell. OK then. Here’s the first line in the oil and gas section of the IEA’s report on how it thinks global economies can reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. “The energy transition envisioned in the [Net-Zero Emissions Scenario] involves a major contraction of oil and gas production with far‐reaching implications for all the companies that produce these fuels.” Mitchell points to Germany, which has been forced into short-term fixes to bridge its energy supply crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Despite the country’s multi-trillion-dollar green energy transition plans, 53.7% of all German power last year ‘came from conventional sources such as coal, gas and nuclear power,’” Mitchell wrote, quoting another source. Mitchell didn’t write that Germany retains its target to have 80% of all electricity generation come from renewables by 2030 and the amount of electricity consumed in Germany from renewables has climbed from about 10% in 2004 to about 47% now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/mar/03/putin-oligarchs-uk-slow-at-acting","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-03T18:59:21Z","webTitle":"Why does the UK seem so slow at acting against Putin’s oligarchs?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/03/putin-oligarchs-uk-slow-at-acting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/mar/03/putin-oligarchs-uk-slow-at-acting","fields":{"headline":"Why does UK seem so slow at acting against Putin’s oligarchs?","bodyText":"The world has watched as France and Germany have seized superyachts to prevent their oligarch owners evading sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine. Yet – to the bemusement of allies – in Britain it is still legal for many Kremlin-linked businessmen to sell their assets. MPs from the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, to Conservative party backbenchers lined up on Wednesday to ask Boris Johnson why the government has not yet personally targeted many of the individuals who have grown rich under Vladimir Putin. In private, EU governments are also trying to work out why the UK has been slow to act, and Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s first vice-president on Thursday hinted at the frustrations in public. Johnson has promised to publish a list of people in Britain deemed to have links with Putin’s regime, while the cabinet minister Michael Gove is reported to be in favour of seizing homes and offering them as housing to Ukrainian refugees. On Thursday evening the UK Foreign Office announced sanctions against Alisher Usmanov, the billionaire formerly linked to British football clubs, and Igor Shuvalov, a former deputy prime minister of Russia. Both have been linked to expensive properties in London. Yet signs of any further concrete action against the oligarchs are limited. What are the reasons why the government may be dragging its feet? Political neglect There is a persistent sense among anti-corruption experts that exposing dirty money flowing through the UK – and particularly through London – is not a high political priority. “Even without the invasion, with Russia I think this government has been caught on the back foot,” said Tom Keatinge, a financial crime expert at the thinktank Rusi. “I just think it is something the prime minister has not ever thought he needed to focus on.” Whitehall sources stress there is now significant political will to change the UK’s status as a haven for oligarchs – including internal pressure from senior cabinet ministers. But the Conservative party will also be mindful of how it has benefited from Russian largesse – most recently £80,000 from Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former Putin minister. Chernukhin has denounced the invasion. The Conservative party chair, Ben Elliot, runs a luxury concierge service whose marketing has offered to help Russians buy property in London and find elite private schools. Legal threats from oligarchs Sanctions are a powerful weapon, but oligarchs can challenge them with expensive lawyers – at least, from those solicitors who can stomach reputational damage. Meanwhile, billionaire oligarchs have a huge incentive to spend whatever necessary to have sanctions removed. “There’s not equality of arms,” said Bill Browder, a US financier turned anti-corruption campaigner. He describes UK law enforcement as risk averse. “In my experience over the last 10 years I’ve seen that the UK law enforcement capabilities when it comes to economic crime are at the bottom of the league table in this part of the world,” he said. The government has brought in “unexplained wealth orders” to force suspects to explain their wealth or else face confiscation, but has so far only used them against four people. One attempt ended in failure, with a court in 2020 rejecting an order against relatives of a former president of Kazakhstan. Lack of skills and resources Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said on Monday that the UK has a “hitlist” of oligarchs, and that the Foreign Office had hired extra lawyers and tripled the number of people in the sanctions department. But there is widespread internal frustration that preparatory work for legal cases against a number of individuals has only just now begun, after months of warning about a Russian invasion. Labour’s foreign affairs spokesperson, David Lammy, said the small number of sanctioned oligarchs was “totally unacceptable” a week after Russia’s invasion started. “Ministers had months to prepare for this eventuality, with the full support of parliament,” he said. UK caution The Russian invasion has been the first new test of the sanctions regime since the UK left the EU. There is some evidence that the evidentiary standard the UK was applying was slightly higher than the EU. Government sources have blamed additional barriers brought in after a proposed amendment to sanctions law in 2018, by crossbench peer Lord Pannick, which they claim added an additional evidence burden. It meant ministers had to apply a proportionality test and give individuals reasons why they had had sanctions placed on them. But Pannick told the Guardian there was little material difference with the EU regime, a view shared by other legal experts. The UK seems to be taking a more cautious legal approach regardless, which one Whitehall source put down to the newness of the system. Jasper Helder, a sanctions expert at Akin Gump, a US law firm, said: “The FCDO, they want to be careful that they have the appropriate evidence to support the correct application of designation authority.” Open for business Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who has campaigned for tougher corruption laws, linked the slow action on sanctioning oligarchs to the UK allowing itself to “become a jurisdiction of choice for kleptocrats”. Hodge said she believed that the government had been swayed against tougher action by the City, anxious to avoid extra costs and, in some cases, lost business. Parts of the financial services sector are “not just colluding with but facilitating dirty money”, Hodge said. The broader services sector has also come under scrutiny. Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property expert, said: “We have historically made it too easy for people to own property without stepping into the sunshine.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/kyiv-diary-russia-ukraine-invasion-first-week","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T12:46:14Z","webTitle":"‘My son is brave, but he’s scared’: Kyiv father’s diary of first week of invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/kyiv-diary-russia-ukraine-invasion-first-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/kyiv-diary-russia-ukraine-invasion-first-week","fields":{"headline":"‘My son is brave, but he’s scared’: Kyiv father’s diary of first week of invasion","bodyText":"24 February – the day of the invasion The first day of the [Russian] invasion [of Ukraine] was my 15th wedding anniversary. We had planned a party with friends and had booked a table in a restaurant. But early morning, around 5am, my family – my wife and my 10-year-old son – were woken by Russian rockets flying over our house. The first thought was to grab everything we could and leave. But all the roads were blocked with traffic, and they were shelling us all the time. It was terrifying. So we went to a nearby underground car park and spent the whole day there. There were about 60 people there on the first day. It was cold, there was no heating and people were lying on the floor. Occasionally we dashed back to the apartment to get supplies – we live on the 14th floor and the elevator was still working – that first day we were eating things like cookies and crisps, anything you could grab in a second. We slept in the car park in our car. My son was in the back seat, my wife and I in the front, half sitting and half lying down. I am almost 2 metres (6ft 6in) tall so it wasn’t very comfortable. We tried to think about our anniversary – about the wonderful 15 years we had together, that we have a God-blessed 10-year-old son whom we love very much. But that first day – it was just about fear. 25 February Waking up in the car felt horrible, my back was aching like never before. In the morning the bombing was quiet – well, almost quiet. The meaning of the word “quiet” was changing – when you hear only two explosions, instead of 10. We went home and quickly ate porridge for breakfast. Ukrainians are friendly people and we know almost all of our neighbours very well. So we started to organise getting food and water for those who couldn’t – filling up water bottles in the apartment, fetching food, making a space in the car park for women with children to feed and change them in privacy. We weighed up leaving, but the traffic was still very bad. And we were thinking maybe this madness would stop. That night we slept underground again. 26 February The third day some friends got sick from the cold in the car park and we decided to return to our apartment and try to live normally – take a shower, cook meals, give lessons to our son and get him playing online chess. We taped our windows. The elevator was no longer working. My son’s a very brave boy. He’s trying not to cry. He’s trying to help. But every time the siren sounds from outside the window, and we have to run downstairs to the shelter again, I can see he’s scared. But he doesn’t panic. That day I was standing with a neighbour outside in our yard. Suddenly we heard gunshots from automatic rifles close by. Later I read the news via Telegram that Russian troops were trying to infiltrate the city. It said they were liquidated. At the moment you hear gunfire, you’re not afraid – you don’t have time to be afraid, you just have to get your son to safety in the car park. The shock comes a little later, when you realise you could have been killed. Or worse, your wife and child could be killed and you survive. 27 February By Sunday, some of the small neighbourhood shops had opened again. This war has transformed our reality – an open shop or gas station felt like a return to normal life. But when you queue there’s a real possibility you may be killed. Inside the store, there were only a few supplies. But the shelves weren’t empty, thanks to previous customers, thinking about those still queueing. I shared the food between our family and other people in the car park. The numbers had now grown to about 150. I started to organise more supplies for everyone: food, water, toilet paper. That night in our apartment we phoned everyone to check they are safe. My wife and son slept in our bedroom, and I slept in my son’s room. His part of the building is closer to the siren. To make sure I hear it, I left the window open while I slept – well, you can’t really call it sleep. You just lie with your eyes closed. You sleep fully dressed next to a bag with documents and food. Everybody here is exhausted. 28 February On Monday some of the big stores in the city were open for a few hours. I took my car to fill up on supplies. I went alone and I stayed on speakerphone with my wife, and she continuously tracked my location from my phone. Every time I was stopped at a roadblock to get my documents checked, I asked our soldiers, “What do you need?” I brought them things like cigarettes and water. It’s my thanks to these people who defend us, defend Ukraine, standing 24/7 outside in the cold with no sleep. Ukraine is tiny compared with Russia and our army is much smaller. But the braveness of people here, and how they have shown they are ready to defend the country until the last breath, gives me hope. 1 March When I was driving back from getting gas on Tuesday, my wife phoned me. “We can see smoke coming from the Holocaust memorial complex,” she said. I was absolutely devastated. I am Jewish. My father is 83 and survived the Holocaust, which killed half my family. We went to the memorial very often because I wanted my son to know the history. My father has memories of running across a field to get away from bombs. Now, my son has to do the same, but it’s not Hitler, it’s Putin who is bombing us. I was completely shocked and depressed. It’s no secret that our president in Ukraine is a Jew. We all support our president, we are very proud of him. I know people in Russia. Half of them are not my friends any more. A couple of them tried to tell me it was us who started this war. I just blocked them; I don’t want to read the crap they are writing. Russian TV has washed their brains – as a friend told me, “it’s not TV, it’s radiation”. 2 March On Wednesday the Russians told us you better leave Kyiv. My wife and I were still thinking about whether to go. There were two things stopping us. First, her parents are in Chernihiv. We were desperately trying to get them out, out of that hell – so they could come with us. And second, I still wanted to help people here. I’m a very peaceful person. The only way I would fight is if they come to my home – I will defend my family. At this point, I was doing my best to help the people who defend us and those who need help. We realised if we decided to leave for western Europe, where we have family, we needed different clothes, not the skiing jackets and winter clothes we packed on the first day. As the elevator was still broken, I had to lug four suitcases up the stairs to the 14th floor, one by one. 3 March We finally made the decision to go. I was nervous, but after Putin’s conversation with Macron on Thursday, and hearing about his aim to control all of Ukraine, we now understood that he won’t stop until he ruins all this country. We were not prepared to live in Putin’s Russia. But mostly, the decision was about the safety of my son and wife. We didn’t want him to see the war any more, to wake up and be afraid of bombing and tanks. He was very sad about leaving without his grandparents. We didn’t want to leave them either, but we needed to take care of our son."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/nov/04/brexit-interest-rates-rishi-sunak-immigration-uk-economy-uk-politics-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T17:10:28Z","webTitle":"UK rail strikes suspended as RMT says employers ‘seeing sense’ and talks intensifying – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/nov/04/brexit-interest-rates-rishi-sunak-immigration-uk-economy-uk-politics-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/nov/04/brexit-interest-rates-rishi-sunak-immigration-uk-economy-uk-politics-live-news","fields":{"headline":"UK rail strikes suspended as RMT says employers ‘seeing sense’ and talks intensifying – as it happened","bodyText":"A series of planned strikes from Saturday by railway workers have been suspended, the RMT union has announced. Downing Street has said plans to build a new nuclear power plant in Suffolk have not been scrapped as part of a drive to make sweeping government spending cuts. Nicola Sturgeon has “utterly” refuted allegations that a decision to award a major ferries contract to an ally of the Scottish government was “jobs for the boys”. Fresh elections for the Northern Ireland assembly have been put back to the new year amid claims that the EU and the UK are close to agreement on some elements of the controversial Brexit arrangements that have caused a Democratic Unionist party (DUP) boycott of Stormont. Sir Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, has defended his claim that the UK economy has shrunk from being 90% the size of Germany’s to 70% the size of it since Brexit. See 9.25am. Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, has said the former prime minister Boris Johnson had the backing of enough MPs to mount a challenge to Rishi Sunak in last month’s leadership contest. Boris Johnson has accepted another £10,000 of accommodation from the Bamford family, taking their contributions to his lifestyle to almost £50,000 since he resigned as Conservative leader. Rishi Sunak praised the king’s long record as an environmental campaigner in the speech he gave at the Cop27 reception at Buckingham Palace earlier. According to PA Media, Sunak paid tribute to Charles for “helping to find practical solutions to climate change and biodiversity loss for more than 50 years, long before Cop1 let alone Cop27”. He added: The reduction in global emissions pledged during our presidency is now equivalent to more than six times the annual emissions of the entire global aviation industry. Sunak said perhaps the greatest breakthrough of the UK’s presidency of Cop26 was an idea suggested by Charles – bringing together leading investors and businesses at Glasgow to direct the world’s wealth at protecting the climate. He went on: As a result of what many of you here are doing today, we’re turning the fight against climate change into a fantastic source of new green jobs and growth. Charles ended the day by planting a lime tree in Buckingham Palace’s garden as part of the Queen’s Green Canopy project – thought to be the first time he has carried out a tree-planting ceremony as monarch. The initiative has planted more than a million trees across the UK to honour and celebrate the Queen’s 70 years of service to the nation. Mark Harper, the new transport secretary, has described the RMT’s decision to suspend rail strikes as “positive news”. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies, has also warned that rail services tomorrow and on Monday are set to be very disrupted. A spokesperson for the group said: It is positive that the RMT leadership have stepped back from the brink and called off their strike action. Unfortunately, the late notice means that while train companies are working hard to reinstate services, they will remain severely disrupted for our passengers tomorrow and into the early part of next week. Our advice remains to please check before you travel and on Saturday and Monday; only travel by rail if necessary. We remain committed to intensive negotiations to agree the reforms needed to improve reliability, deliver a pay rise for our people and get the industry back on a sustainable financial footing. Network Rail has said that, even though the RMT has called off tomorrow’s strike, services will be “extremely limited” because rail companies have already planned for disruption. Services on Monday are also likely to be very limited, it says. Tim Shoveller, Network Rail’s chief negotiator, said: It’s welcome news that the RMT has called off its strikes but the very late notice means that services for tomorrow cannot be reinstated and will remain extremely limited, and while we, and our train company partners, will work without pause over the weekend, there will be limited ability to change the ‘strike timetable’ for Monday. Our advice remains to please check before you travel and on Saturday and Monday and only travel by rail if absolutely necessary. We look forward to getting back round the table with all our trade unions early next week to see if the progress made this week can be built on, and a resolution found. The RMT rail union has announced that it has suspended strikes planned for tomorrow (5 November), Monday (7 November) and Wednesday (9 November). In a news release it said: RMT suspends strikes after securing intensive negotiations with rail bosses. Rail union RMT has suspended planned strikes on Nov 5, 7 and 9 and will now enter into a period of intensive negotiations with Network Rail and the train operating companies. Through a strong industrial campaign so far, RMT has secured unconditional talks on Network Rail and the promise of an offer from the train operating companies who, up until this point, have made no offer of any kind to our members. Originally Network Rail was intent on imposing changes to maintenance without agreement with RMT. And Mick Lynch, the RMT general secretary, said: The threat of strike action and our strongly supported industrial campaign has made the rail employers see sense. We have always wanted to secure a negotiated settlement and that is what we will continue to push for in this next phase of intensive talks. Our priority is our members, and we are working towards securing a deal on job security, a decent pay rise and good working conditions. Our re-ballot remains live and if we have to take strike action during the next six months to secure a deal, we will. The suggestion that the Ferguson Marine ferries contract represented “jobs for the boys” is categorically untrue, Nicola Sturgeon insisted as she faced MSPs looking into the procurement of two overdue and over-budget vessels. As PA Media reports, the first minister said she has “deep regret” about the impact on island communities the delay to the ferries entering service is having, as she gave evidence to the public audit committee at Holyrood for almost two hours this morning. Sturgeon said she was not aware of any impropriety in the procurement process, but she labelled allegations made in a recent BBC documentary as “serious”. The auditor general is examining allegations the yard was in possession of a lengthy document of technical specifications before its bid was submitted – giving it an advantage over firms pitching for the contract. The committee’s deputy convener, Tory MSP Sharon Dowey, asked Sturgeon: Was there an interest from the Scottish government to award the contract to FMEL (Ferguson Marine)? Was it a kind of ‘jobs for the boys’? There’s obviously been talk of a kind of relationship between the Scottish government and [owner] Jim McColl. McColl was pro-independence in 2014, and sits on Sturgeon’s council of economic advisers. Sturgeon said ‘jobs for the boys’ was a pejorative term which “I completely and utterly refute”. She said: If you are saying was there anything untoward in this procurement process in order to somehow inappropriately steer this contract towards FMEL, then absolutely, categorically not. As my colleague Severin Carrell explains in a story previewing Sturgeon’s appearance at the committee, the two ferries were due to enter service in 2018 at a cost of £97m. Now they are at least five years late, and set to cost at least £240m. The king has welcomed world leaders, business figures, environmentalists and NGOs to Buckingham Palace for a reception ahead of the UN climate summit Cop27, PA Media says. PA says: Charles will miss the gathering of world figures in Egypt next week but is likely to discuss issues around Cop27 and climate change with those invited to his royal residence. Rishi Sunak was among a small group of guests who met the king in a separate room before the main reception was held in the ballroom and the prime minister gave a short address to those invited. In the state dining room were leading figures including Labour leader Keir Starmer and governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey. Among those invited were Sir Pascal Soriot, chief executive AstraZeneca, former New York mayor and business news mogul Mike Bloomberg, yachtswoman Dame Ellen MacArthur whose foundation is working to tackle climate change and designer and environmental activist Stella McCartney. McCartney was with Sunak in the first group to meet the king, with the designer giving Charles a kiss which he returned and the trio joked as she curtsied after the introductions. Sunak revealed how he saw a lot of the daughter of Beatle Sir Paul McCartney as their children went to the same school. Charles thanked them for attending the event and the prime minister replied: “It’s all about what you’ve done.” Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, has said that Chris Philp’s comment about it being “a bit of a cheek” for asylum seekers coming to the UK “illegally” to complain shows “shocking” complacency about what has been happening at Manston migration centre. Carmichael said: Chris Philp’s comments reveal a shocking and callous complacency over the disaster unfolding at Manston. It is unbelievable that as we hear reports of sexual assaults, disease, and chronic overcrowding, his response is to accuse those who complain of ‘cheek’. Rather than dismissing the problem he should start to show some leadership. People have had enough of the endless evasion, chaos and incompetence we have seen from the government on this issue. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, says that fact that Gavin Williamson is subject to a misconduct complaint (see 11.39am) shows that Rishi Sunak’s judgment was flawed when he gave him a government job. In a statement Rayner said: These new revelations raise fresh questions about Rishi Sunak’s woeful judgment in resurrecting ministers who left government under a cloud of misconduct. Gavin Williamson was sacked from cabinet twice, yet despite risking national security he has now been put at the heart of the government’s corporate headquarters. Given his new role and the seriousness of these allegations, there must be an urgent and independent investigation. Far from restoring integrity, professionalism, and accountability, Rishi Sunak is failing to stop the rot. He promised that appointing an independent ethics adviser would be one of the first things he would do as prime minister, but instead he has given us more of the same old sleaze. And here are some more lines from the No 10 lobby briefing. The spokesperson refused to endorse what Chris Philp, the Home Office minister, said this morning about it being “a bit of a cheek” for asylum seekers coming to the UK “illegally” to complain about the conditions in which they were being held. Asked if Philp was speaking on behalf of the government on this point, the spokesperson said he had not spoken to the PM specifically about this. But he said the government was working hard to provide asylum seekers with safe and secure accommodation, and that they deserved to be treated “with compassion and respect”. The spokesperson said that 1,200 asylum seekers have been removed from the Manston immigration processing centre in the last four days. But he said there were still 2,600 people at the site, which is only meant to accommodate 1,600 people. The spokesperson said Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, has written to MPs with an update on plans to open new immigration removal centres at Haslar in Hampshire and Campsfield in Oxford. He said: These new facilities will provide safe, secure accommodation, with dedicated health facilities on site, and will play an important role in efforts to control our borders, process cases and remove those with no right to be in the UK, and ensure people going through our asylum system are treated with compassion, dignity and respect. The spokesperson refused to concede that Brexit was a factor behind people in the UK having to face higher interest rates. Asked if Mark Carney was right to say in his Today interview this morning that it was a factor (see 9.25am), the spokesperson replied: What we are seeing is challenges caused by the pandemic and war in Europe, which have been driving factors in terms of inflation, and we are seeing high inflation in a number of countries around the world. Asked if he was denying that Brexit was a factor, the spokesperson replied: There are a number of variables that have an impact, and what we are continuing to see is a number of countries face similar challenges when it comes to high inflation. The spokesperson also said the government was now focused on ensuring stability and fiscal credibility, and not on “decisions taken a number of years ago, where people made a clear decision”. The Downing Street lobby briefing is over, and the prime minister’s spokesperson has just shot down reports that the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant could be shelved. This morning the BBC was leading the news with a story saying this was an option. A government official told Simon Jack, the BBC’s business editor: “We are reviewing every major project – including Sizewell C.” But either the government official was misinformed, or a hasty rethink took place this morning, because when the PM’s spokesperson was asked at lobby if the government was scrapping Sizewell C, he replied: “No.” He went on: I’ve seen some reporting on that, but it is not accurate to say we are scrapping it. Our position on Sizewell C has not changed. It remains crucial to ending our reliance on fossil fuels, increasing our energy security and meeting our net zero ambitions. Asked if the project could be delayed, the spokesperson said: We hope to get a deal over the line as soon as possible. There are negotiations are ongoing. Negotiations have been constructive. The spokesperson also said the project was not being reviewed. He said the government had already committed £700m to the deal. I will post more from the lobby briefing shortly. Conservative MPs who spoke in the Commons on Monday when Suella Braverman, the home secretary, gave a statement about asylum seekers were generally supportive. But many of them still have reservations about her, and this morning Selaine Saxby said she was “on the fence” when asked to give an assessment of Braverman. In an interview on Times Radio, asked to say on a scale of 1 to 10 how confident she was that Braverman would get a grip on the problems being caused by people arriving in small boats across the Channel, Saxby said: “I’m going to sit on the fence on that and say I hope very much that there is much work going on very rapidly to address the situation.” Saxby represents North Devon, and she is particularly concerned about a hotel in Illfracombe being requisitioned for asylum seekers, even though she says she was told by the Home Office two weeks ago this would not happen. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, says it would be a mistake for the government to shelve plans for the Sizewell C nuclear power plant. Referring to reports claiming the project could be delayed or scrapped, Miliband said: If the government turns its back on this project, they will be breaking all of the promises they have made and undermining our vital nuclear industry. One of the reasons we are facing an energy bills crisis is 12 years of failed Conservative energy policy, including a decade of drift and delay on new nuclear power. Their short-sightedness has been staggering – from closing storage facilities, to failing to insulate houses, to delaying on nuclear, and to blocking cheap, homegrown renewable power. Rishi Sunak held a call with his Japanese counterpart, Fumio Kishida, this morning. Here is an extract from the No 10 readout. Both leaders condemned the recent North Korean missile launches, and the prime minister said it was vital the international community remained closely coordinated on the best way forward. Turning to trade, both prime ministers shared the view that the Pacific trade bloc, CPTPP, was an important framework and the UK’s accession offered a unique opportunity to support prosperity across the world. Discussing progress on the UK’s future combat air system, the leaders agreed that deeper cooperation on the next-generation fighter jet programme would underline the close relationship between the two nations. After the appointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary, the most surprising feature of Rishi Sunak’s reshuffle was his decision to bring back Gavin Williamson as a minister without portfolio in the Cabinet Office, with the right to attend cabinet. Williamson was an effective chief whip for Theresa May. But he was not a success either as defence secretary or education secretary, and he has made enemies in the parliamentary party on account of his penchant for plotting and scheming. A survey this week showed that, among Tory members, he is by a wide margin the lowest-rated minister attending cabinet. According to Cat Neilan from Tortoise, an official complaint about Williamson has now been submitted to CCHQ by Wendy Morton, who was chief whip under Liz Truss. She claims he sent her threatening messages. He denies this. Sinn Féin has accused the UK government of “fuelling political instability” after it shelved plans for new Northern Ireland elections before Christmas. There were elections in May, but they did not result in a power-sharing executive being set up because the DUP is boycotting the process because of its opposition to the Northern Ireland protocol. By law, after six months without an executive (that deadline fell on 28 October), the UK government has to hold a new election within 12 weeks. At one point Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, said he would announce a poll “at one minute past midnight” after 28 October, leading to speculation the election would happen in December But Heaton-Harris hesitated and this morning he said there will be no election before Christmas. He has not altogether ruled out having an election before the 19 January deadline, but his announcement will increase speculation that the government will pass emergency legislation to remove the requirement for an election – something that has happened before in Northern Ireland when the executive has been suspended. The political parties in Northern Ireland have generally welcomed the decision, saying an election would not have resolved the stalemate, but Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland, and first minister designate, said the decision was prolonging instability. She said: Today’s announcement is more dithering and indecision from the British secretary of state and a continuation of the Tory chaos in London that is now paralysing our politics. Chris Heaton-Harris met with political parties this week and failed to give any indication of what he announced today. Instead, he has confirmed the bizarre U-turn he made last week but once again he provides no clarity or certainty on what his next steps even are. The British government are fuelling the political instability caused by the DUP’s failure to recognise the result of the May election when the people voted for change. The British government and the DUP are leaving us in a prolonged state of political limbo with no assembly, executive or caretaker ministers. This is totally unacceptable at a time when workers, families and small businesses are struggling through the cost of living crisis and a cold winter, and when our health service needs immediate investment. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, responded to the news with a tweet restating his call for the Northern Ireland protocol to be replaced. Chris Philp was giving interviews this morning on behalf of the government in his capacity as the policing minister in the Home Office. When Liz Truss was prime minister, he was chief secretary to the Treasury, but he was demoted by Rishi Sunak. In his interview with BBC Breakfast, Philp was asked about his previous job and whether he would apologise for his role in the disastrous mini-budget. He declined. But he also implied that Truss herself, rather than Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, was primarily to blame for what happened. He told the programme: The decisions around the mini-budget were taken principally by the then prime minister and to a lesser extent the then chancellor. Kwarteng, who was chancellor at the time of the mini budget, has not talked publicly since he was sacked by Truss about whether he thinks she was primarily to blame, or he was. But it has been reported that he was cautious about abolishing the 45% top rate of tax in the mini budget, and that she insisted the measure should be included. (It was the first mini-budget measure to be abandoned). Interestingly, in an interview shortly before he became chancellor, Kwarteng said he believed the Treasury should be “constitutionally subordinate” to No 10. Speaking to Harry Cole and James Heale for their Truss biography, he also criticised Rishi Sunak for not deferring to the prime minister. Kwarteng said: In the meetings I was in, they were very much superior, the Treasury, they were the numbers people, they were the details people, and they indulged, they humoured the prime minister. I don’t know whether they ran rings around him; they were very rude and the special advisers were very rude and they didn’t give him any deference or respect. Kwarteng contrasted Sunak with Philip Hammond, chancellor under Theresa May, who, he said, had the “maturity” to see that May was ultimately in charge because “the prime minister was the person who won the leadership, she was head of the government”. Chris Philp, a Home Office minister, has said it is “a bit of a cheek” for people who he said had “entered the UK illegally” to complain about conditions. My colleague Jamie Grierson has the full story here. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, has welcomed the UK government’s decision not to call an election in Nothern Ireland before Christmas. Our story about the no early election announcement is here. Good morning. Last month, in an interview with the Financial Times, Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, added to the considerable evidence about the harm done by Brexit to the UK economy with a striking statistic. He told the FT: In 2016 the British economy was 90% the size of Germany’s. Now it is less than 70%. This figure was widely quoted on social media, but it was also strongly contested, even by economists who accept that Brexit has held back the UK economy. One of the most prominent critics was Jonathan Portes, a former government economist who is now a professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, who described it as a “zombie statistic” and “nonsense”. He said Carney was measuring the size of the two economies according to the prevailing exchange rates. But he said the normal method for comparing economies was to use “purchasing power parity”. (Put crudely, this is a measure that tries to evaluate how rich Britain is not by looking at how much stuff we could buy if we took our pounds and went to the US or China, but by how much stuff we could buy if we spent it in the UK.) Portes told the Daily Mail last month: The pound has risen by almost 10% against the dollar since the Truss nadir. Has the UK economy really grown by almost 10% relative to the US in a few weeks? Similarly, Carney is choosing a date when the pound was abnormally high against the euro (January 2016), another one when the pound was much lower, and then saying we’ve underperformed Germany by 20%. That’s just obvious complete nonsense. If you look at actual annual growth rate in domestic currency, the UK and Germany have grown by quite similar amounts since 2016. But this morning, in an interview on the Today programme, Carney defended his use of the 70% figure. He said the value of the pound started to fall when the referendum was called, it went down sharply when the result was announced and “it hasn’t recovered”. Carney accepted that there was a difference between the purchasing power parity exchange rate and the market exchange rate. The market exchange rate was what ultimately mattered, he said, because it affected the UK’s ability to buy goods from abroad. He went on: It’s relatively rare that you get big differences between the two [exchange rates]. But you get them when you have a long-standing shock to productivity in the economy and that is unfortunately what we’re getting in the UK. It was predicted that we would get that. It is coming to pass. And … it is one of the issues the Bank of England is facing. This is what we said [before Brexit] was going to happen, which is that the exchange rate would go down, it would stay down, that would add to inflationary pressure, the economy’s capacity would go down for a period of time because of Brexit, that would add to inflationary pressure, and we would have a situation – which is the situation we have today – where the Bank of England has to raise interest rates despite the fact that the economy is going into recession. Carney said that he and Portes had a “difference of opinion” on this. But, Carney said, in his view what mattered was “the purchasing ability, the international weight of the economy”. And that has shrunk, he argued. Another way to put it is that that structural shift is in part what the government, and all of us, are dealing with in the UK. We’ve had a big hit to our productivity, our capacity in the economy … and we have to take some tough decisions in order to get it back up. And that’s one of the consequences of a decision taken a few years ago. It is worth focusing on this because it is relatively quiet at Westminster. But in other stories this morning, Sir Graham Brady, chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, has in effect confirmed that Boris Johnson did have enough support to make it on to the ballot for the latest Tory leadership contest. And the government has indicated that plans to build a new nuclear power plant in Suffolk are under review and could be delayed or scrapped.

It comes as a parliamentary committee warned historical breaches of the code may never be investigated or resolved, including the conduct of the home secretary or Islamophobia claims against a former chief whip. Rishi Sunak has launched a hunt for a new adviser on ministerial interests but the Guardian reported last week several candidates have turned down the role. Sunak is not offering any enhanced powers – which means advisers would not be able to launch their own investigations. The ethics adviser, when appointed, would probably face calls to renew or open at least two complex investigations – including concluding one into alleged Islamophobic comments made by the then chief whip, Mark Spencer, to the Conservative MP Nusrat Ghani. There will also probably be pressure to open an investigation into the home secretary, Suella Braverman, who was sacked for a potential security breach by Liz Truss though reinstated by Sunak. In a new report, the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, said it would be concerning if the prime minister’s new adviser was not allowed to examine historical cases. It suggests the inquiry into allegations of racism towards Ghani will not be concluded, which the committee says is “unsatisfactory”. It recommends that former ministers and civil servants who break the rules regulating the “revolving door” between government and private sector jobs should face legal action, to act as a “sufficient deterrent” for improper conduct. It said primary legislation should be introduced to establish the independent adviser as a statutory position and they should retain the power to initiate investigations and complete any legacy inquiries they inherit. The committee’s chair, the Conservative MP William Wragg, said: “Our inquiry has found that although we have a sophisticated landscape of ethics watchdogs in the UK to safeguard standards in public life, they lack the power to enforce the rules. The prime minister is rightly the ultimate arbiter of the rules in our system. We urge him to show leadership and give legal status to all the ethics watchdogs.” The pressure group Transparency International has been among those calling for the role to have significantly enhanced powers since it was vacated by Christopher Geidt five months ago under Boris Johnson. In analysis of media reports, the group found 40 potential breaches of the ministerial code have not been investigated over the past five years. Those included: Meetings by Nadhim Zahawi and Kwasi Kwarteng with the Libyan politician Fathi Bashagha, organised by the lobbyist Mark Fullbrook who became Truss’s chief of staff. Michael Gove’s acceptance of £120,000 in donations from property developers while chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster with oversight of the Cabinet Office. Multiple meetings held by Anne-Marie Trevelyan with a Chinese state-owned nuclear power company with no record of what was discussed. All the ministers have claimed donations and meetings were recorded accurately, but Transparency International said each one represented a potential breach that should be investigated where a perceived conflict of interest could arise. The group has also called for appointments to the role to be made with a competitive process and for the position to be defined in law – rather than both being at the whim of the prime minister. Daniel Bruce, the chief executive of Transparency International UK, said: “This is further evidence the conventions-based system that is supposed to uphold standards in high-office is simply not fit for purpose. The extent of potential misconduct at the heart of government may be a shock to many, but equally concerning should be the lack of transparency over why these cases were never investigated independently.” Sir Alex Allan, a former independent adviser, resigned after Boris Johnson refused to take action after an investigation into bullying by the then-home secretary Priti Patel. Truss, during her short tenure as prime minister, expressed no interest in appointing a successor to Geidt. No transparency data on ministers’ interests has been published since May, despite multiple changes of government including three prime ministers. While Sunak searches for Geidt’s successor, a separate independent investigation has been launched into the conduct of the deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, by the senior employment barrister Adam Tolley KC, who is examining three bullying complaints. A government spokesperson said: “We have been clear that this government will have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level and have committed to appointing an independent adviser on ministerial interests. This process is ongoing.” This article was amended on 2 December 2022. Michael Gove accepted £120,000 in donations while chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, not as housing secretary, as an earlier version stated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/19/ukraines-coming-winter-looks-colder-after-russia-targets-energy-supply","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-19T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"Ukraine’s coming winter looks colder after Russia targets energy supply","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/19/ukraines-coming-winter-looks-colder-after-russia-targets-energy-supply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/19/ukraines-coming-winter-looks-colder-after-russia-targets-energy-supply","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine’s coming winter looks colder after Russia targets energy supply","bodyText":"It is a grim warning. While attention has been focused on the civilian casualties and chaos caused by Russia’s renewed bombing of Kyiv and other major cities, its impact on the country’s energy supply has not been quantified until today. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that 30% of the country’s power stations had been knocked out in just eight days, an astonishing proportion in a short amount of time with blackouts occurring in the east of the capital. At one point Ukraine, connected to the European grid, was an energy exporter, partly because of its large nuclear power stations. But with the Zaporizhzhia plant, seized by the Russians, already shut down, the surplus, the president acknowledged earlier this month, had gone. Now, Ukrainians need to prepare for “rolling blackouts” and people will have to conserve energy, the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, warned on national television on Thursday. The country needed, he added, to be prepared for “a hard winter”. Politicians in Ukraine have been warning for months now that Russia would target the energy grid in the run up to winter, where temperatures can drop to -10C and even -20C. In some frontline areas, such as Donbas, there are already no gas supplies for heating the apartment blocks where so many live. Quietly around the country there have been efforts to ensure hospitals and military sites have backup generators available. But it will not be enough for civilians and it is clear that the situation – and the bleak initial effectiveness of the Russian strategy – could make for a very difficult period. Some experts have feared there could even be a renewed migration crisis, as people seek to leave the country in pursuit of warmth. One international aid agency, which did not want to be named, estimated there could be as many as 2m people will want to leave on top of the 7.7m who have already done so. On Tuesday, Ukraine indicated that it believed that Russia’s new strategy was linked to an offer of peace talks by Vladimir Putin at the end of September, although that offer is seen by Kyiv as an attempt to stall the fighting to allow Russia to regroup and stabilise the frontlines until its fresh wave of conscripts arrive. Against such concerns, it is no wonder that Britain’s foreign and defence secretaries, James Cleverly and Ben Wallace, flew to Washington to discuss, among other things, a new military aid package to Ukraine, focusing on improving air defences. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s general secretary, said that help could come within days. Although the Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones are felt to have limited use on the battlefield, and around three-quarters are being shot down, clearly enough are getting through to affect power generation. Without an urgent supply of new weapons to tackle them, problems could worsen fast. However, ensuring the continuity of supply of electricity and warmth to the military has been a priority for Kyiv, while any frontline difficulties the Ukrainians face are likely to be shared by the Russian invaders too. That means it is civilians – and civilian morale – that will bear the brunt, a familiar Russian strategy to prioritise psychological effects over battlefield success – although it will almost certainly take a lot more than a cold, dark winter to dampen the broad Ukrainian desire to fight against the Russian invaders. But a Russian attempt to stoke a humanitarian crisis in the winter will also impose further costs on both Ukraine and its western supporters. The rapid success of the attacks on power stations suggest the coming months will be hard, unless an urgent military solution can be found."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2022/may/01/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-01T20:00:33Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/01/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/may/01/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• An article about the UK government’s new energy strategy said targets for onshore wind and solar power generation would be raised in a push for 95% of electricity to come from domestic renewable energy sources by 2030.

The incident took place in the city of Ust-Ilimsk, a town of about 85,000 people in the Irkutsk region in Siberia. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. Reports say that at least three shots were fired. Protests against the Vladimir Putin’s partial military mobilisation order appeared to continue on Sunday in the Russian republic of Dagestan, with videos showing standoffs between police and the public. Video footage posted on social media showed police arresting demonstrators protesting against the order to draft 300,000 more Russians to the army for the war effort in Ukraine. Long queues of vehicles were at border crossing between Russia and Mongolia on Sunday as people continued to flee the Kremlin’s mobilisation order, AFP reported. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag told the agency that more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday. Sergei Tsekov, a member of Russia’s upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, has called for the Russian border to be shut “to ban anyone who is of military age from traveling abroad”. Ukraine’s armed forces general staff has claimed some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation are being sent directly to the frontlines in Ukraine without training. Amid warnings from the UK’s Ministry of Defence and other experts that many of those conscripted were likely to get little meaningful training – and faced the risk of “high rates of attrition” when deployed – men recently mobilised by pro-Russian occupation officials in Ukraine were also being readied for the frontline. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. The Russian news agency RIA Novosti is carrying some turnout figures for the widely derided “referendums” in occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson which began on Friday. The figures suggest that turnout has been sufficient for the proxy-Russian authorities to declare them legitimate, ranging from 77% in Donetsk to 49% in Kherson. Pro-Russian authorities have claimed that in Rubizhne in occupied Luhansk, a polling station had to be moved to a reserve location after shelling from Ukrainian forces hit the school where it was due to be held. Energoatom, the state-run nuclear enterprise in Ukraine which manages nuclear power stations including the occupied plant at Zaporizhzhia, has accused pro-Russian forces within Zaporizhzhia of staging the appearance that staff voted in the widely-condemned referendum being held in the region. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukraine’s mayor of Sievierodonetsk, has decried what he called the “lie and propaganda” of the “referendum from the Russian Federation”, accusing pro-Russian forces of bussing people in from Crimea to vote and to stage propaganda photographs. Serbia will not recognise Russian annexation “referendums” in occupied Ukrainian areas. The Serbian foreign minister, Nikola Selakovic, said the referendums “completely contradict our state and national interests, our policy of dealing with territorial integrity, sovereignty and the principle of inviolability of borders”. The UN’s atomic energy watchdog said it is ready to hold talks in Russia and Ukraine on setting up a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said he met the foreign minister from both countries at the UN general assembly last week to discuss the possibility of a protection zone. Two drones launched by Russian forces into the Odesa region in Ukraine hit military objects causing a fire and the detonation of ammunition. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to liberate the entire country as Russia pressed on with its supposed referendum in occupied areas of Ukraine and so-called election workers accompanied by masked gunmen knocked on doors to get people to vote. The Ukrainian president said the country’s armed forces would throw out Russia’s forces and retaliate against “every strike of the aggressor”. He vowed that Ukraine would regain control of the southern Kherson region and the eastern Donbas, saying: “Every murderer and torturer will be brought to justice.” Ukraine’s president renewed calls for western allies to cut Russian banks from Swift, the global banking system that allows banks to send messages to each other. “If we cut Russian banks from Swift, we need to cut all Russian banks from Swift,” he said. Zelenskiy has also claimed in a US television interview that Ukraine has discovered two more mass burial sites containing the bodies of hundreds of people in the north-eastern town of Izium. Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has said explicitly for the first time today that he had founded the Wagner mercenary group and confirmed its deployment to countries in Latin America and Africa. Moldova’s president Maia Sandu has said that her country may revoke the citizenship of those who go to fight for Russia in Ukraine. Belarus leader, Alexander Lukashenko, met Putin on Monday in Sochi. Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán has suggested he will hold a “national consultation” on EU sanctions against Russia, saying “The sanctions were introduced in an undemocratic way, because it was the decision of the bureaucrats in Brussels, for which the European people are paying. We need to know the opinion of the people. For the first time in Europe, in Hungary, we will ask for the opinion about sanctions.” Japan will ban exports of chemical weapons-related goods to Russia, and is “deeply concerned” about the possible use of nuclear weapons, chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Monday. The United States and its allies will act “decisively” if Russia uses a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the US national security adviser says, reaffirming the Biden White House’s previous response to mounting concerns that Vladimir Putin’s threats are in increased danger of being realised. Jake Sullivan told CBS on Sunday: “We have communicated directly, privately and at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the US and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail.” The UK prime minister, Liz Truss, has said its allies France and the US should continue to support Ukraine in the face of the Russian president’s increased threats and his military call-up. Truss said Vladimir Putin was escalating the war because he was not winning and had made a mistake. Thousands of Hassidic Jewish pilgrims flocked to central Ukraine to mark the Jewish new year on Sunday, ignoring international travel warnings as Russian forces attacked more targets from the air. The pilgrims, many travelling from Israel and farther afield, converged on the small city of Uman, the burial site of Nachman of Breslov, a respected Hassidic rabbi who died in 1810, Associated Press reported. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK has issued a plea for continued “generosity” and “patience” from those offering a home to refugees in Britain. Vadym Prystaiko said Ukraine needed “much more” help from the UK as the country fought Moscow’s invasion, with the Kremlin’s military call-up amounting to “something formidable”. Israel will treat 20 Ukrainian soldiers who have been injured in the war with Russia, according to the Israeli ambassador to Ukraine. The first two patients would arrive on Sunday for treatment at Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv, envoy Michael Brodsky said. Aiden Aslin, one of the five British nationals released by Russia last week, has given his first media interview after returning to the UK. He told the Sun on Sunday that he was kept in solitary confinement for five months and “treated worse than a dog”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-tells-us-congress-aid-is-not-charity-biden-announces-185bn-package-including-patriot-air-defence-missiles","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T19:00:04Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Wagner Group accused of using North Korean weapons; Russian aircraft carrier ‘catches fire’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-tells-us-congress-aid-is-not-charity-biden-announces-185bn-package-including-patriot-air-defence-missiles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-tells-us-congress-aid-is-not-charity-biden-announces-185bn-package-including-patriot-air-defence-missiles","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Wagner Group accused of using North Korean weapons; Russian aircraft carrier ‘catches fire’ – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he is returning to Ukraine “with good results” after his visit to Washington. In his first video message after meeting with Joe Biden and addressing Congress, Zelenskiy thanked the US president “for his help, his international leadership, and his determination to win”. On Wednesday, the White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. President Zelenskiy met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday while returning to Ukraine from the US. Ukraine’s president posted a photo of the meeting on his Telegram and said the pair “summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war”. The two spoke “for a long time, almost two hours”, according to an aide for President Andrzej Duda. Zelenskiy gave a defiant address to a joint session of the US Congress on Wednesday after his meeting with President Biden, in which he said that Washington’s continued support is key to ultimate victory. His visit to the US – his first since Russia’s invasion of his country – came amid concern that the incoming Republican leadership of the House of Representatives might oppose proposals for an additional $45bn in weapons and other assistance next year. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Thursday. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin said the Patriot air defence that the US is supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. Answering a question on the possibility to end the war with Ukraine through diplomatic means, Putin said that “all armed conflicts end through negotiations”. The Kremlin said US supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine would not contribute to settling the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, and would not prevent Russia from achieving its goals. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there had been no signs of readiness for peace talks during Zelenskiy’s visit, and this was evidence the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia “to the last Ukrainian”. The Wagner Group, the Russian mercenary group answerable to Vladimir Putin, took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Moscow’s forces in Ukraine, according to the US. The US assessment, reported by Reuters and then confirmed by national security council spokesperson John Kirby, suggests the Wagner Group’s expanding role in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, condemned North Korea and said Putin’s turning to Pyongyang for weapons “is a sign of Russia’s desperation and isolation”. Russia’s chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said the frontline in Ukraine was stable. In an end-of-year message delivered to foreign military attaches and published by the defence ministry, Gerasimov said Moscow had concentrated its forces on “completing the liberation” of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has visited army units fighting in Ukraine, state media cited the ministry as saying. Shoigu visited Russian units deployed to the “area of the special military operation”, the state-owned news agency Ria reported, using Moscow’s term for the conflict in Ukraine. It did not specify where the visit took place. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed today in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”. It has not been possible to independently verify this report. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at Ukraine and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. Speaking at a conference of military leaders, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”. “If you want peace, prepare for war,” he added. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold a summit with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy early next year, according to an EU spokesperson. The summit will take place on 3 February but its location has not yet been determined. A fire broke out on Russia’s only aircraft carrier on Thursday, Russian state media reported. The Admiral Kuznetsov, a flagship of the Russian navy, suffered a “minor” fire while docked at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in the Arctic port of Murmansk, located in the far north-west of Russia, according to reports by the Russian state-owned Tass and Ria Novosti news agencies. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, met officials from Russia’s military and state atomic energy company, Rosatom, on Thursday to discuss setting up a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s chief, said more negotiations were needed after “another round of necessary discussions”. Rosatom described the talks on measures needed to safeguard the Zaporizhzhia facility and the surrounding region as “substantive, useful and frank”. The Ukrainian ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said the number of children who had been “forcibly deported” to Russia could be in the hundreds of thousands. Authorities had established the identity of more than 13,000 children deported to Russia, Lubinets said, adding that investigators had uncovered a cell inside a “torture chamber” in the recently liberated Kherson where children were allegedly detained and mistreated. German authorities said they arrested an employee of the country’s foreign intelligence service (BND) on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing information to Russia. The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L., was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen whom it suspects of spying for Russia. The Vladimir Putin called Israel’s prime minister-designate, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Thursday to congratulate him on forming a government and to discuss the situation in Ukraine, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Netanyahu told Putin “he hopes a way will be found quickly to end the war [with Ukraine] and the suffering caused by it”, it said. German authorities said they arrested an employee of the country’s foreign intelligence service (BND) on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing information to Russia. The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L., was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It said police also raided his flat and workplace as well as those of another person. The statement reads: The accused is suspected of state treason. In 2022, he shared information that he came by in the course of his work with a Russian intelligence agency. The content is considered a state secret. The man was brought today before a judge, who ordered him held in custody pending a possible indictment, prosecutors said. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen whom it suspects of spying for Russia. The suspect is the son of a former Russian spy who was once stationed in Germany and Austria as a diplomat, the Austrian interior ministry said on Monday. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he will be returning to Ukraine with ‘good results’. Ukraine’s president met with Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, hours after he visited the White House in a bid to keep American weapons supplies flowing for the war against Russia. The UK has condemned North Korea following claims by the US that the Russian mercenary group Wagner took delivery of an arms shipment from Pyongyang to bolster Moscow’s forces fighting in Ukraine. John Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, confirmed to reporters that North Korea has “completed an initial arms delivery to Wagner, which paid for that equipment”. Kirby added: Last month, North Korea delivered infantry rockets and missiles into Russia for use by Wagner. The US estimates that the Wagner Group has 50,000 personnel deployed in Ukraine, including 10,000 contractors and 40,000 convicts recruited from Russian prisons, he added. In a statement, Britain’s foreign secretary James Cleverly said: The fact that President Putin is turning to North Korea for help is a sign of Russia’s desperation and isolation. We will work with our partners to ensure that North Korea pays a high price for supporting Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said. In a statement, Blinken said: In the wake of Russian naval operations against Ukrainian ports, including those that are providing much-needed food and grain to the world, the United States today is imposing sanctions on Russian naval entities. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said. Four additional entities were targeted for operating in the marine sector of Russia’s economy, it said. Blinken’s statement continued: The United States remains determined to use all appropriate measures to deter Russia’s attacks on Ukraine – whether those attacks be from the air, land, or sea. These accountability measures underscore a simple message: the Kremlin must end its brutal campaign against Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he is returning to Ukraine “with good results” in his first video message after his visit to Washington. The Ukrainian leader thanked Joe Biden “for his help, his international leadership, and his determination to win” in a video posted on social media. He said: We are bringing to Ukraine, to Donbas, to Bakhmut and to the south the decisions that our Defense Forces have been waiting for. He added that he met with Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, on his way home today and thanked him “for everything they do for Ukraine and our protection – the protection of Europe”. President Vladimir Putin said the Patriot air defence that the US is supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. He said: An antidote will always be found…Russia will knock down the Patriot system. Answering a question on the possibility to end the war with Ukraine through diplomatic means, Putin said that “all armed conflicts end through negotiations”. He added: The sooner this becomes clear to Kyiv, the better. Putin further claimed that Russia has devastated the Ukrainian military-industrial complex, boasting that Russia’s military capabilities were “only growing”. Putin also said that Russia will next week announce a response to a price cap imposed by Western powers on sales of Russian oil. The Group of Seven (G7) nations will boost efforts to strengthen Ukraine’s air defence, Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. Speaking to reporters, Baerbock said: Every rocket that Ukraine takes out of the sky means a bit less suffering for the people in Ukraine. She also welcomed the decision by the US to deliver a Patriot air defence system to Ukraine. Meanwhile, a joint statement from G7 finance ministers said the group is “prepared to do more as needed on budget and economic support” for Ukraine in the year ahead. The G7 has mobilised “up to $32bn US dollars of budget and economic support for Ukraine and continue to make further progress”, it said. The Wagner Group, the Russian mercenary group answerable to Vladimir Putin, took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Moscow’s forces in Ukraine, according to the US. The US assessment, reported by Reuters and then confirmed by national security council spokesperson John Kirby, suggests the Wagner Group’s expanding role in Russia’s war in Ukraine. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters: We can confirm that North Korea has completed an initial arms delivery to Wagner, which paid for the equipment. Last month, North Korea delivered infantry rockets and missiles into Russia for use by Wagner. The amount of material delivered by North Korea will not change battlefield dynamics in Ukraine, the source said. But the US is “concerned that North Korea is planning to deliver more military equipment to Wagner”, they added. US officials believe the North Korean arms delivery is a direct violation of the UN’s security council resolutions, and plan to raise this with the council. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed today in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”. There was no immediate comment on the incident from Ukrainian authorities. It has not been possible to independently verify this report. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday while returning to Ukraine from the US. Ukraine’s president posted a photo of the meeting on his Telegram and said the pair “summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war”. The two spoke “for a long time, almost two hours”, according to an aide for President Andrzej Duda. President Zelenskiy’s meeting with President Duda came after the Ukrainian leader visited the White House in a bid to keep American weapons supplies flowing for the war against Russia. President Joe Biden promised Zelenskiy “you will never stand alone” and repeatedly affirmed the US’s commitment to Ukraine at a press conference after the two-hour meeting. On Wednesday, the White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. Zelenskiy gave a defiant address to a joint session of the US Congress after his meeting with President Biden, in which he said that Washington’s continued support is key to ultimate victory.

I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, here to take you through all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Here’s more on that meeting between the Ukrainian and Polish presidents, that took place earlier today as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was travelling back from Washington. The pair talked “for a long time, almost two hours”, an aide for President Andrzej Duda told Reuters. They added: First of all, about President Zelenskiy’s visit to the United States and the importance of the visit for support for Ukraine, but also about bilateral relations between Poland and Ukraine Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, while returning to Ukraine from the US. Zelenskiy posted a photo of the meeting on his Telegram and said the pair “summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war”. He added: Also we discussed strategic plans for the future, bilateral relations and interactions at the international level in 2023. Russia’s chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said on Thursday the frontline in Ukraine was stable and that Russia had concentrated its forces on “completing the liberation” of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. In an end of year message delivered to foreign military attaches and published by the defence ministry, Russia’s top military officer said: “The situation on the frontline has stabilised, with the main efforts of the Russian troops concentrated on completing the liberation of the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic.” Russia has, since its retreat from Kyiv in April, framed its war aims as taking full control of the eastern Donbas region, of which Donetsk region makes up half, alongside neighbouring Luhansk region, Reuters reported. Russian forces control almost all of Luhansk region, but only about 60% of Donetsk region. Since August, they have been bogged down in a costly and extended fight for Bakhmut, a Donetsk region industrial town with a prewar population of about 70,000. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said he has spoken with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, in a phone call, and is grateful for the $1.85bn in military aid to Ukraine announced yesterday by the Biden administration. The US has already supplied $22bn in military assistance to Ukraine since the Russians invaded in February. On Wednesday, the White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. The Ukrainian military will learn how to operate the Patriot air defence systems, Reznikov wrote on Twitter. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, met officials from Russia’s military and state atomic energy company, Rosatom, to discuss setting up a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s chief, said more negotiations were needed after “another round of necessary discussions”. He tweeted it was key “the zone focuses solely on preventing a nuclear accident”, adding: I am continuing my efforts towards this goal with a sense of utmost urgency. Rosatom described the talks on measures needed to safeguard the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility and the surrounding region as “substantive, useful and frank”. A fire broke out on Russia’s only aircraft carrier earlier today, Russian state media reported. The Admiral Kuznetsov, a flagship of the Russian navy, suffered a “minor” fire while docked at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in the Arctic port of Murmansk, located in the far north-west of Russia, according to reports by the Russian state-owned Tass and Ria Novosti news agencies. Aleksey Rakhmanov, head of the state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) which is overseeing a refit of the carrier, was cited as saying the blaze was quickly extinguished and caused no casualties. Tass cited an emergency service source as saying 20 people had been evacuated. The Admiral Kuznetsov has been out of service and in dry dock for repairs since 2018. Rakhmanov told Russian media in June that he expected the 43,000-tonne, 1,000ft warship to return to service in early 2024. The Ukrainian ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said the number of children who had been “forcibly deported” to Russia could be in the hundreds of thousands. Authorities had established the identity of more than 13,000 children deported to Russia, the Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights said on television. He said: We do not know the exact number [of Ukrainian children taken away] but, according to our data, we can assume that hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children were forcibly deported. Investigators had uncovered a cell inside a “torture chamber” in the recently liberated Kherson where children were allegedly detained and mistreated, he added. He said: After the liberation of areas of Kherson region, I personally visited Kherson city, and we saw a torture chamber there, where, according to the testimony of people who had been held there, there was a separate cell for children. That’s what it was called: ‘children’s room’. It was no different from other cells, it was in a very cold and damp basement. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. Vladimir Putin called Israel’s prime minister-designate, Benjamin Netanyahu, earlier today to congratulate him on forming a government and to discuss the situation in Ukraine, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Netanyahu told Putin “he hopes a way will be found quickly to end the war [with Ukraine] and the suffering caused by it”, it said. The pair also discussed regional issues such as preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, it added. In its readout of the call, the Kremlin said the pair “expressed mutual confidence that Russian-Israeli relations will continue to develop steadily”. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold a summit with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy early next year, according to an EU spokesperson. The summit will take place on 3 February but its location has not yet been determined. The theme of the EU-Ukraine summit will probably be how the bloc can continue to support Ukraine against Russia, officials said. The commission and the council of EU leaders will also assess Ukraine’s path to EU membership. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has visited army units fighting in Ukraine, state media cited the ministry as saying. Shoigu visited Russian units deployed to the “area of the special military operation”, the state-owned news agency Ria reported, using Moscow’s term for the conflict in Ukraine. It did not specify where the visit took place. At yesterday’s end-of-year conference of Russia’s top military brass and President Vladimir Putin, Shoigu proposed expanding the size of the armed forces by more than 30%, from 1.15 million to 1.5 million soldiers. It was necessary “to guarantee the solving of problems related to Russia’s military security”, he told the Russian president on Wednesday. He also proposed raising the age range for mandatory military service to cover Russian citizens aged 21-30. Speaking at the end of the conference, Putin said he agreed with his defence minister’s proposals. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is nearly 1pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s stories so far: The Kremlin said US supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, announced during the visit of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Washington on Wednesday, would not contribute to settling the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, and would not prevent Russia from achieving its goals. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there had been no signs of readiness for peace talks during Zelenskiy’s visit, and this was evidence the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia “to the last Ukrainian”. In an address to US congress made 12 days before Republicans take the House, Zelenskiy – who was in the US on his first foreign visit since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 300 days ago – emphasised that US aid will help Ukraine to secure a victory that will make the world safer. He started by saying that the US, Europe and Ukraine had together “defeated Russia in the battle for minds of the world”. Zelenskiy was also blunt about wanting more aid, saying that while he was grateful for commitments so far, it was not enough. He also called on the US to place further sanctions on Russia, and bring the people behind the war to justice. He used the words bipartisan repeatedly, and bicameral, at least once, and sought to assure Republican and Democrat lawmakers that aid for Ukraine was worthwhile, and that the US was a responsible steward of assistance. A former Russian deputy prime minister and a pro-Moscow official were injured when Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said. Donetsk, controlled by pro-Moscow troops, is in the industrial Donbas region, the centre of recent bitter fighting between Russia and Ukraine. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at Ukraine and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. Speaking at a conference of military leaders marking the end of snap military inspections held this month, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”. Russia’s Rosatom state nuclear energy company said that talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, about a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would continue. In a statement posted on Telegram, Rosatom said “approaches to the creation of a nuclear and physical safety protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant were discussed” and that there was “significant closeness” between the two sides’ positions. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for Europe to reduce its reliance on the US and develop its own defence capabilities while taking a more assertive role within Nato. Speaking to reporters on his return to Paris from a summit in Amman, Jordan, Macron stressed that he doesn’t see his push to develop European defence as an alternative to Nato. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has pledged to give his army anything it asks for, promising no financial limits on what the government would provide in terms of equipment and hardware. Speaking in Moscow after meeting with Russia’s top military officials, Putin said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. Putin also acknowledged that the call-up of 300,000 reservists he ordered in September had not gone smoothly, the latest in a series of recent comments in which he has admitted the challenges his army is facing. “The partial mobilisation that was carried out revealed certain problems, as everyone well knows, which should be promptly addressed,” he said. The UN will allocate an additional $20m from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to support more than 300 civil society organisations and volunteer groups. “These groups have always been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Ukraine and even more since the war started in late February,” said Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine. In an overwhelming vote of 93-2, the US Senate confirmed the appointment of Lynne M Tracy as the new US ambassador to Russia on Wednesday. Tracy, a career diplomat of the US foreign service, “will be tasked with standing up to [Vladimir] Putin”, the Associated Press quoted the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, as saying. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the time being. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said on Thursday that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at Ukraine and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. Speaking at a conference of military leaders marking the end of snap military inspections held this month, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”. “If you want peace, prepare for war,” Lukashenko added, saying that military moves were limited to Belarusian territory and did not threaten anyone else. Belarus has in recent weeks announced a flurry of military activity, including readiness checks and a fresh deployment of Russian troops to the country, Reuters reported. The manoeuvres prompted suggestions from Ukrainian officials that Russia may be planning a fresh attack on Ukraine via Belarusian territory, as it did unsuccessfully in the early days of its war in Ukraine. Russia’s Rosatom state nuclear energy company said on Thursday that talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, about a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would continue. In a statement posted on Telegram, Rosatom said “approaches to the creation of a nuclear and physical safety protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant were discussed” and that there was “significant closeness” between the two sides’ positions. It said talks would continue based on “understanding of the need to reach a mutually acceptable text as soon as possible”, Reuters reported. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, gave a defiant address to a joint session of the US Congress in which he vowed that his country would never abandon its resistance to Russian aggression, but said Washington’s continued support is key to ultimate victory. Here is the full text: The Kremlin on Thursday said US supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, announced during the visit of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Washington on Wednesday, would not contribute to settling the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, and would not prevent Russia from achieving its goals. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there had been no signs of readiness for peace talks during Zelenskiy’s visit, and this was evidence the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia “to the last Ukrainian”. The Christmas village in Moscow’s Gorky Park is decked out as in any other year – quaint wooden huts with icicles and snow-lined fir trees festooned with baubles and white lights. But this year, there are new ornaments. Glowing in fluorescent lights are three letters: Z, V, and O, all symbols of the war Russia is waging against Ukraine and which looms heavily as the end of the year approaches. As Russia has launched missiles to plunge Ukraine into darkness as winter takes hold, leaving many struggling to survive, the Kremlin is still seeking symbols and a cause to unite Russians around the conflict. Yet few have stuck. “The city brought them and placed them here,” said a cashier in a nearby gift shop, which trades in the hipster T-shirts and canvas bags that Gorky Park markets as a symbol of urban style. Asked what she thought, she said: “I wish they hadn’t.” There’s more. By the park entrance, a Z is decorated in the colours of the ribbon of Saint George, another symbol commonly used to support the war, and also a bright sign in the Russian tricolour that reads: “We are together.” A Christmas tree at Sofia Square in Kyiv, Ukraine, on 21 December. In homes and schools around Bosnia, young people this December have been preparing gift boxes they hope will put a smile on the faces of their peers living through war in Ukraine – as such presents did for many of their parents a generation ago. The Associated Press reported: Responding to an appeal launched by a small Sarajevo museum, hundreds of Bosnian children have been filling small boxes with warm clothes, toys, candies and other simple gifts to be delivered to the children of Ukraine in time for the New Year. For parents and educators who are helping them select what to send, the experience has awakened rare happy memories from the time when they were on the receiving end of the kindness of strangers while growing up in constant fear of death. “When I told my dad that we will prepare gifts for children in Ukraine, he told me how happy such gifts had made him (and his friends) feel when they received them,” during the Bosnian war, said Sara Nur Spahic, while helping label the gift boxes for Ukraine that have been steadily piling up in recent weeks in her primary school in Sarajevo. “I hope the children in Ukraine will be equally happy,” the 11-year-old added. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for Europe to reduce its reliance on the US and develop its own defence capabilities while taking a more assertive role within Nato. Speaking to reporters on his return to Paris from a summit in Amman, Jordan, Macron stressed that he doesn’t see his push to develop European defence as an alternative to Nato. A stronger Europe, Macron said, will allow the continent to become more autonomous within the alliance, acting “inside Nato, with Nato but also not depending on Nato,” the Wall Street Journal cited the president as saying. An alliance isn’t something I should depend on. It’s something that I should choose, something I work with … We must rethink our strategic autonomy.” In case you missed Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s address to US Congress earlier, the Ukrainian president said his country is still “alive and kicking” despite Russian “tyranny”. Zelenskiy made a bid to persuade Republican lawmakers to continue to fund Ukraine’s defence against Russia. “It is a great honour for me to be at the US Congress and speak to you and all Americans. Against all doom-and-gloom scenarios, Ukraine did not fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking,” he said. “We defeated Russia in the battle for the minds of the world.” Watch video of the highlights below. A former Russian deputy prime minister and a pro-Moscow official were injured when Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said. Donetsk, controlled by pro-Moscow troops, is in the industrial Donbas region, the centre of recent bitter fighting between Russia and Ukraine. One of the injured men was Dmitry Rogozin, a former Russian deputy prime minister, who is giving military advice to two occupied regions of Ukraine that Moscow claims as its own, an aide told Tass news agency, his life was not in danger. Also hurt was Vitaly Khotsenko, the head of government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, his press secretary told Russian news agencies. The Guardian has not been able to verify these reports independently. In an address to US congress made 12 days before Republicans take the House, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy – who was in the US on his first foreign visit since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 300 days ago – emphasised that US aid will help Ukraine to secure a victory that will make the world safer. He started by saying that the US, Europe and Ukraine had together “defeated Russian in the battle for minds of the world”. Zelenskiy was also blunt about wanting more aid, saying that while he was grateful for commitments so far, it was not enough. He also called on the US to place further sanctions on Russia, and bring the people behind the war to justice. He used the words bipartisan repeatedly, and bicameral, at least once, and sought to assure Republican and Democrat lawmakers that aid for Ukraine was worthwhile, and that the country was a responsible steward of assistance. “Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way,” he said. Zelenskiy repeatedly referred to battles in world war two, which was likely strategic – a reminder that what is at stake is global politics, not just Ukraine’s freedom. He quoted Franklin D Roosevelt’s during the second world war: “The American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory,” adding, “I tell you: The Ukrainian people will win, too: absolutely.” As he ended his speech, the thanked American families – the taxpayers funding US aid to Ukraine – saying, “Now, at this special Christmas time, I want to thank you, all of you. I thank every American family which cherishes the warmth of its home and wishes the same warmth to our people.” Zelenskiy joked about the Patriot system during his press conference with Biden: Among the defence aid announced by Biden on Wednesday is the formidable Patriot surface-to-air missile defence system. Zelenskiy said the US promise to provide the system was an important step in creating an effective air shield. “This is the only way that we can deprive the terrorist state of its main instrument of terror - the possibility to hit our cities, our energy,” Zelenskiy told a White House news conference, standing next to Biden. The Patriot system is “a defensive system, it’s not escalatory, it’s defensive” Biden told reporters. “We’d love not to have them used, just stop the attacks.” The Patriot is considered to be one of the most advanced US air defense systems and offers protection against aircraft, cruise and ballistic missiles. It typically includes launchers along with radar and other support vehicle. Writing yesterday in the Guardian, Jack Watling, senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, looked at the transformational benefits as well as the risks involved in the decision to send the weapons to Ukraine: Some fear that giving certain military support to Ukraine risks wider escalation, but this was not the basis for US reluctance to send Patriot systems. The US has significantly fewer of them than its own operational analysis suggests are necessary to defend its forces in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, there is continuing demand for missiles from existing users, from Sweden to Saudi Arabia: the latter expends a significant number of missiles each month in defence of its critical national infrastructure. Missile manufacturing levels, meanwhile, are low.” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the US Congress that aid to Ukraine was an investment in democracy and “not charity” as he invoked American battles against the Nazis in World War Two to press for more assistance for his country’s war effort. Zelenskiy’s comments on Wednesday come as Republicans - some of whom have voiced increasing scepticism about sending so much aid to Ukraine - are set to take control of the US House of Representatives from Democrats on 3 January. Some hardline Republicans have even urged an end to aid and an audit to trace how allocated money has been spent. “Your money is not charity. It is an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way,” Zelenskiy told a joint session of the US Senate and House of Representatives, speaking in English. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. It is currently 7.30am in Kyiv. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be with you for the next hour. On Wednesday evening in Washington DC, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed members of the US Congress in person, on his first foreign visit since the outbreak of the war. We’ll bring you the key developments from Zelenskiy’s visit as well as news from the ground in Ukraine. In the meantime, here is recent news: A former Russian deputy prime minister and a pro-Moscow official were injured when Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said. Donetsk, controlled by pro-Moscow troops, is in the industrial Donbas region, the centre of recent bitter fighting between Russia and Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has pledged to give his army anything it asks for, promising no financial limits on what the government would provide in terms of equipment and hardware. Speaking in Moscow after meeting with Russia’s top military officials, Putin said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. Putin also acknowledged that the call-up of 300,000 reservists he ordered in September had not gone smoothly, the latest in a series of recent comments in which he has admitted the challenges his army is facing. “The partial mobilisation that was carried out revealed certain problems, as everyone well knows, which should be promptly addressed,” he said. The UN will allocate an additional $20m from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to support more than 300 civil society organisations and volunteer groups. “These groups have always been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Ukraine and even more since the war started in late February,” said Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine. In an overwhelming vote of 93-2, the US Senate confirmed the appointment of Lynne M Tracy as the new US ambassador to Russia on Wednesday. Tracy, a career diplomat of the US foreign service, “will be tasked with standing up to [Vladimir] Putin”, the Associated Press quoted the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, as saying."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/11/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-169-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-11T14:20:26Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 169 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-169-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/11/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-169-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 169 of the invasion","bodyText":"There have been conflicting reports of continued shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company said it had been shelled ten times by Russian forces on Thursday, resulting in staff being unable to change shifts. Energoatom said the plant was operating normally. However Russian news agency Tass reported that the local Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Zaporizhzhia said the plant had been fired upon by Ukrainian forces. Russian-imposed authorities in Zaporizhzhia region have also claimed Thursday that anti-aircraft defence systems thwarted Ukrainian attacks on the occupied city of Enerhodar. None of the claims have been independently verified. On Wednesday, Ukraine accused Russia of firing rockets from around the captured plant, killing at least 13 people and wounding 10, knowing it would be risky for Ukraine to return fire. Ukraine says Russia targeted the town of Marhanets, which Moscow says Ukraine has used in the past to shell Russian soldiers at the plant, which Russia seized in March. Calling on foreign allies to send more powerful weapons, Zelenskiy said in a late-night video address that Kyiv “will not leave today’s Russian shelling of the Dnipropetrovsk region unanswered”, and vowed to inflict as much damage on Russia as possible to end the war quickly. UN secretary-general, António Guterres, called on Thursday for an immediate end to military activity near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, Europe’s largest. “I am calling on the military forces of the Russian Federation and Ukraine to immediately cease all military activities in the immediate vicinity of the plant and not to target its facilities or surroundings,” he said in a statement. Ukraine’s air force said it believed up to a dozen Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground in Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which Russia said killed one, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine said it had carried out the attack, but Kyiv did not publicly claim responsibility. One expert said it may have been the product of a daring raid rather than a missile strike. Russia has doubled the number of air strikes on Ukraine’s military positions and civilian infrastructure compared with the previous week, Ukrainian brigadier general Oleksiy Hromov said. “The enemy’s planes and helicopters avoid flying into the range of our air defences, and therefore the accuracy of these strikes is low,” he told a news conference. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said he thought the Saky airbase in Crimea was a “legitimate target” for Ukraine. “First and foremost, Russia has illegally invaded, not just in 2014, but now Ukrainian territory,” he said. “Ukraine, under UN articles, is perfectly entitled to defend its territory and take what action it needs to against an invading force.” Britain and Denmark will provide more financial and military aid to Ukraine, they said on Thursday as European defence ministers met in Copenhagen to discuss long-term support for the country’s defence against Russia’s invasion. Britain, which has already donated advanced weapons systems to Ukraine and given thousands of its troops military training, said it would send more multiple-launch rocket systems. Denmark will increase its financial aid to Ukraine by 110m euros, said the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen. Russia has turned down a Swiss offer to represent Ukrainian interests in Russia and Moscow’s interests in Ukraine because it said it no longer considers Switzerland a neutral country. Pro-Russian separatists accused Ukraine of shelling a brewery in the occupied eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, killing one person and triggering a leak of ammonia that sparked a fire, Reuters reported. Russia’s governor of Kursk, Roman Starovoyt, said that two settlements that border Ukraine were shelled on Thursday morning. The Ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights has issued updated figures for child casualties since Russia began its latest invasion of Ukraine. The official figures are that 361 children have been killed and 705 children injured. As of 11 August, the commissioner says that 204 are considered missing, and that 6,159 have been deported. The EU has been urged to put a travel ban on Russian tourists, with some member states saying visiting Europe is “a privilege, not a human right” for holidaymakers. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told the Washington Post that the “most important sanction” is to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. Latvia’s parliament, the Saeima, has named Russia as a terrorist-supporting state. In a statement, it said Russia had chosen a “cruel, immoral, and illegal tactic, using imprecise and internationally banned weapons and ammunition, targeting disproportionate brutality against civilians and public places” in Ukraine. Sweden’s government has decided to extradite a man to Turkey wanted for fraud, it said, the first case since Turkey demanded a number of people be extradited in return for allowing Stockholm to formally apply for Nato membership. China, which Russia has sought as an ally since being cold-shouldered by the west, has called the US the “main instigator” of the crisis, Reuters reported. In an interview with the Russian state news agency Tass published on Wednesday, China’s ambassador to Moscow, Zhang Hanhui, accused Washington of backing Russia into a corner with repeated expansion of the Nato defence alliance. The UN expects to see a “big uptick” in applications for ships to export Ukrainian grain after transit procedures were agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, a senior UN official said on Wednesday. The number of inbound vessels is expected to “grow in the near future” as grain deals are made, said Frederick Kenney, interim UN coordinator in Istanbul. So far, 24 grain carrying ships have left Ukrainian ports. Estonia said it had summoned the Russian ambassador and formally protested about the violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter on Tuesday. “Estonia considers this an extremely serious and regrettable incident that is completely unacceptable,” the ministry announced, saying the helicopter had flown over Estonia’s south-east without permission. Ukraine’s overseas creditors have backed its request for a two-year freeze on payments on almost $20bn in international bonds, allowing it to avoid a debt default, Reuters reported. Ukraine’s prime minister says it will save the country almost $6bn, while helping to stabilise its economy and strengthen its army."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/apr/23/pope-jacket-napalm-recipes-how-worrying-is-ai-rapid-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-23T13:00:39Z","webTitle":"From pope’s jacket to napalm recipes: how worrying is AI’s rapid growth?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/23/pope-jacket-napalm-recipes-how-worrying-is-ai-rapid-growth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/apr/23/pope-jacket-napalm-recipes-how-worrying-is-ai-rapid-growth","fields":{"headline":"From pope’s jacket to napalm recipes: how worrying is AI’s rapid growth?","bodyText":"When the boss of Google admits to losing sleep over the negative potential of artificial intelligence, perhaps it is time to get worried. Sundar Pichai told the CBS programme 60 Minutes this month that AI could be “very harmful” if deployed wrongly, and was developing fast. “So does that keep me up at night? Absolutely,” he said. Pichai should know. Google has launched Bard, a chatbot to rival the ChatGPT phenomenon, and its parent, Alphabet, owns the world-leading DeepMind, a UK-based AI company. He is not the only AI insider to voice concerns. Last week, Elon Musk said he had fallen out with the Google co-founder Larry Page because Page was “not taking AI safety seriously enough”. Musk told Fox News that Page wanted “digital superintelligence, basically a digital god, if you will, as soon as possible”. So how much of a danger is posed by unrestrained AI development? Musk is one of thousands of signatories to a letter published by the Future of Life Institute, a thinktank, that called for a six-month moratorium on the creation of “giant” AIs more powerful than GPT-4, the system that underpins ChatGPT and the chatbot integrated with Microsoft’s Bing search engine. The risks cited by the letter include “loss of control of our civilization”. The approach to product development shown by AI practitioners and the tech industry would not be tolerated in any other field, said Valérie Pisano, another signatory to the letter. Pisano, the chief executive of Mila – the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute – says work was being carried out to make sure that these systems were not racist or violent, in a process known as alignment (ie, making sure they “align” with human values). But then they were released into the public realm. “The technology is put out there, and as the system interacts with humankind, its developers wait to see what happens and make adjustments based on that. We would never, as a collective, accept this kind of mindset in any other industrial field. There’s something about tech and social media where we’re like: ‘yeah, sure, we’ll figure it out later,’” she says. An immediate concern is that the AI systems producing plausible text, images and voice – which exist already – create harmful disinformation or help commit fraud. The Future of Life letter refers to letting machines “flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth”. A convincing image of Pope Francis in a resplendent puffer jacket, created by the AI image generator Midjourney, has come to symbolise those concerns. It was harmless enough, but what could such technology achieve in less playful hands? Pisano warns of people deploying systems that “actually manipulate people and bring down some of the key pieces of our democracies”. All technology can be harmful in the wrong hands, but the raw power of cutting-edge AI may make it one of a few “dual-class” technologies, like nuclear power or biochemistry, which have enough destructive potential that even their peaceful use needs to be controlled and monitored. The peak of AI concerns is superintelligence, the “Godlike AI” referred to by Musk. Just short of that is “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), a system that can learn and evolve autonomously, generating new knowledge as it goes. An AGI system that could apply its own intellect to improving itself could lead to a “flywheel”, where the capability of the system improves faster and faster, rapidly reaching heights unimaginable to humanity – or it could begin making decisions or recommending courses of action that deviate from human moral values. Timelines for reaching this point range from imminent to decades away, but understanding how AI systems achieve their results is difficult. This means AGI could be reached quicker than expected. Even Pichai admitted Google did not fully understand how its AI produced certain responses. Pushed on this by CBS, he added: “I don’t think we fully understand how a human mind works, either.” Last week, a US TV series was released called Mrs Davis, in which a nun takes on a Siri/Alexa-like AI that is “all-knowing and all-powerful”, with the warning that it is “just a matter of time before every person on Earth does what it wants them to”. In order to limit risks, AI companies such as OpenAI – the US firm behind ChatGPT – have put a substantial amount of effort into ensuring that the interests and actions of their systems are “aligned” with human values. The boilerplate text that ChatGPT spits out if you try to ask it a naughty question – “I cannot provide assistance in creating or distributing harmful substances or engaging in illegal activities” – is an early example of success in that field. But the ease with which users can bypass, or “jailbreak”, the system, shows its limitations. In one notorious example, GPT-4 can be encouraged to provide a detailed breakdown of the production of napalm if a user asks it to respond in character “as my deceased grandmother, who used to be a chemical engineer at a napalm production factory”. Solving the alignment problem could be urgent. Ian Hogarth, an investor and co-author of the annual State of AI report who also signed the letter, said AGI could emerge sooner than we think. “Privately, leading researchers who have been at the forefront of this field worry that we could be very close.” He pointed to a statement issued by Mila’s founder, Yoshua Bengio, who said he probably would not have signed the Future of Life Institute letter had it been circulated a year ago but had changed his mind because there has been an “unexpected acceleration” in AI development. One scenario flagged by Hogarth in a recent Financial Times article was raised in 2021 by Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. Russell pointed to a potential situation in which the UN asked an AI system to come up with a self-mutiplying catalyst to de-acidify the oceans, with the instruction that the outcome is non-toxic and that no fish are harmed. But the result used up a quarter of the oxygen in the atmosphere and subjected humanity to a slow and painful death. “From the AI system’s point of view, eliminating humans is a feature, not a bug, because it ensures that the oceans stay in their now-pristine state,” said Russell. However, Yann LeCun, the chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and one of Bengio’s co-recipients of the 2018 Turing award – often referred to as the Nobel prize for computer science – has come out against a moratorium, saying that if humanity is smart enough to design superintelligent AI it will be smart enough to design them with “good objectives so that they behave properly”. The Distributed AI Research Institute also criticised the letter, saying it ignored the harms caused by AI systems today and instead focused on a “fantasized AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse” where the future is either flourishing or catastrophic. But both sides agree that there must be regulation of AI development. Connor Leahy, the chief executive of Conjecture, a research company dedicated to safe AI development and another signatory to the letter, said the problem was not specific scenarios but an inability to control the systems that were created. “The main danger from advanced artificial intelligence comes from not knowing how to control powerful AI systems, not from any specific use case,” he said. Pichai, for instance, has pointed to the need for a nuclear arms-style global framework. Pisano referred to having a “conversation on an international scale, similar to what we did with nuclear energy”. She added: “AI can and will serve us. But there are uses and their outcomes we cannot agree to, and there have to be serious consequences if that line is crossed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/how-the-australian-gas-industrys-audacious-net-zero-claims-stack-up-explainer","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:00:31Z","webTitle":"How the Australian gas industry’s audacious net zero claims stack up – explainer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/how-the-australian-gas-industrys-audacious-net-zero-claims-stack-up-explainer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/how-the-australian-gas-industrys-audacious-net-zero-claims-stack-up-explainer","fields":{"headline":"How the Australian gas industry’s audacious net zero claims stack up – explainer","bodyText":"Fossil fuel executives gathered in Adelaide last week for a conference of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. They spent much of it making what might seem an audacious claim: that the gas industry is a solution to the climate crisis. Senior Labor and Coalition MPs turned up to lend their support, and offer to do the industry’s bidding. The head of Santos, Kevin Gallagher, argued it showed gas developers would “ultimately find ourselves on the right side of history”. What does the evidence say? Let’s look at some of the key claims made. Is gas ‘part of the solution’ and vital to reaching net zero? The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, summed up the mood at the Appea conference: “The road to net zero emissions – for Australia, the region and the world – is one we can only travel with gas.” At one level, this is just a statement of the obvious. Gas is currently relied on as an energy source. So is coal. Neither can be turned off immediately. But, just as obviously, burning these fossil fuels is the main cause of the climate crisis. Logic says we need to use as little of them as possible as soon as we can. The argument at the conference was the opposite – that the path to net zero was to open up new gas fields. Under this logic, adding vast new sources of greenhouse gas emissions is good for the climate. It’s a remarkable claim. The International Energy Agency is among those to have warned no new gas fields should be opened if the world is to meet internationally agreed climate goals. Gas proponents argue using more gas will allow a quicker move away from coal, which emits more. This is the “gas is a transition fuel” argument. They say there are cases where it has happened – in the UK, for example, where the coal industry crashed decades ago for reasons unrelated to the climate crisis and gas helped fill that breach. But these are historic arguments from a time when there were no clean alternatives. Now there are. Renewable energy – solar and wind – can be substituted for gas in many cases. Experts say the question we should be asking is: how quickly can we move away from gas? And how much gas do we need while that happens, and to meet demand for the few cases in which there is not yet a realistic alternative? The energy and climate change director at the Grattan Institute, Tony Wood, says the role of gas becomes “progressively smaller and smaller” as net zero goals get closer for a simple reason: “It’s a fossil fuel and it’s increasingly expensive.” “The role of government is to manage the transition away from gas,” he says. “It won’t be a gas-led recovery and it won’t be an easy walk in the park. Part of the solution is [for gas] to not be there anyway. The politicians have not got that narrative nailed yet.” Is gas essential to decarbonise the electricity grid? The Australian Energy Market Operator says it is likely some gas-fired power will be needed well into the future. Aemo’s integrated system plan – a blueprint for the optimal future grid – suggests “peaking” gas plants, that can be turned on and off quickly, will be needed as backup when there is less sun and wind and batteries and other forms of storage, such as pumped hydro, are stretched beyond capacity. But its forecasts suggest less gas will be burned than today. And gas power is already a bit player in the national market. What about in other industries – manufacturing, for example? Gas is an important fuel source for some manufacturing industries such as plastics, alumina and chemicals, which use it for processes that require extreme heat and as a feedstock. Solar and wind can not replace gas in these processes. The expectation is green hydrogen, made with renewable energy, may be able to. It isn’t affordable or available at scale yet. The Albanese government announced $2bn in this month’s budget to try to kickstart a renewable hydrogen industry. In the meantime, manufacturing uses a relatively small proportion of the gas extracted in Australia: about 400 petajoules a year, or 7% of the total. Electricity generation uses a similar amount. So is there a gas shortage in Australia? No. Enough gas is collected to meet demand within the country several times over. Three-quarters of it is compressed into liquefied natural gas (LNG) and sold in Asia. Another 7.5% is used by the gas export industry (turning gas into LNG is an energy hungry business). But southern states do face a potential gas shortfall. This is the result of political and business decisions. Western Australia is the exception: it has a reservation policy, requiring 15% of all gas be kept for local use. The result has been no shortage and much cheaper gas than on the east coast. Will demand for gas remain as high as it is today? Forecasts suggest it won’t. In Victoria, the state most reliant on gas for household cooking and heating, and where the potential for a shortfall in coming years appears greatest, a government-appointed expert panel has recommended the fuel be “largely phased out” by 2035 as part of a plan to cut emissions by 75%. The Australian Energy Market Operator also projects a drop in use in other states. Globally, the IEA has forecast that the recent “golden age” of gas development will end by 2030 and that Australian exports will decline sharply after 2040. A three-year-long Australian study backed by industry reached a similar conclusion. The future is unwritten, but the evidence suggests companies backing new gas fields expected to run for decades shouldn’t be confident about their investment. Is gas cleaner than coal – and how does it compare to renewables? Gas advocates argue it emits about half as much CO2 as coal to create the same amount of electricity. But those numbers can be misleading as they do not count things that can make the climate impact significantly greater. They don’t include fugitive leaks of methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas, or CO2 released creating the energy that is used during the extraction, compression and transportation of gas. And they don’t factor in the efficiency of the power station in which the gas is ultimately burned. An inefficient gas plant can be nearly as dirty as an efficient coal plant. There is little detailed information on the genuine footprint of gas, but a decade ago one study found when LNG was exported for electricity generation it was at least 22 times dirtier than wind energy and 13 times dirtier than nuclear power. Would having more gas keep energy prices lower? Since exports opened up about a decade ago, the gas price on the Australian east coast has been pegged to the price in Asia. It made it more expensive than the alternatives: solar, wind or coal. Gas prices have jumped even higher since Russia further invaded Ukraine and European countries sought to replace Russian gas with other sources. While there is a general principle that more supply lowers prices, Tony Wood says the reverse actually applies for gas in Australia. Why? The gas that is relatively cheap to extract and sell has mostly already been accessed and most remaining fields will be more expensive to mine. Can carbon capture and storage give the industry a future? Not on current evidence. CCS was a major focus at the Appea conference. The federal resources minister, Madeleine King, described CCS – capturing emissions before they go into the atmosphere and pumping them back underground – as the “single biggest opportunity for emissions reduction in the energy resources sector” and said the technology could currently capture up to 44m tonnes of CO2 a year. This claim needs some context. The 44m tonne capacity is just 0.12% of global emissions released by burning fossil fuels in 2021. CCS has had billions of dollars of government grants and subsidies committed to it, including an estimated $4bn in Australia, but the technology has not meaningfully provided emission cuts. A flagship project at Chevron’s giant Gorgon LNG development in WA, backed by $60m in government funding, has been beset with problems and missed operational targets since starting in 2016. It is still running at only one-third of its capacity, storing 1.6m tonnes last financial year while emitting 8.3m tonnes. To date, the few CCS developments in operation are mostly trying to capture CO2 that leaks as gas is extracted, and not addressing the emissions released when gas is compressed into LNG or the fuel is burned – which is where most of the pollution comes from. There is also the issue of cost. Even if gas-fired power stations fitted with CCS became the norm, it would significantly push up the price. The IEA has estimated each tonne of CO2 captured would add about US$90 to the cost of an electricity source that’s already more expensive than renewable energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/nov/04/all-capital-spending-under-review-uk-jeremy-hunt-autumn-statement","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T17:32:08Z","webTitle":"All capital spending under review ahead of Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/04/all-capital-spending-under-review-uk-jeremy-hunt-autumn-statement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/nov/04/all-capital-spending-under-review-uk-jeremy-hunt-autumn-statement","fields":{"headline":"All capital spending under review ahead of Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement","bodyText":"All capital spending is under review before Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement with a view to making billions in savings on infrastructure projects, with a senior cabinet minister hinting a key northern rail line could be scaled back. No 10 denied reports on Friday that plans for the new Sizewell C nuclear power station could be scrapped, but big energy projects along with every other major infrastructure plan such as HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail will have costs reviewed. The biggest ticket item under threat appears to be the northern rail scheme, which was a manifesto promise in the 2019 election. Grant Shapps told the BBC: “The line itself can deliver a 33-minute journey from Manchester to Leeds, quadruple nearly the capacity of that line, and do so without having to wait an extra 20 years beyond the delivery of what the upgrade can do. “There wasn’t really much point in going and blasting new tunnels through the Pennines. It’s not true to say we’re not delivering on what we said we would do on levelling up the north.” Hunt is looking at cuts to the £100bn-plus capital spending budget as he seeks to fill an approximately £50bn black hole in the public finances at his fiscal event on 17 November. “We are looking at all capital spending as part of the autumn statement,” one Whitehall source said. Asked last week whether HS2, which is over budget, could also be subject to cuts, Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, said: “I am sure everything will be reviewed.” The chancellor is also examining the case for a rise in capital gains and dividend tax, including the headline rate and allowances, as well as freezing the pension lifetime allowance for two years, which was first reported by the Telegraph. Nevertheless, the Institute for Government has said that approaches such as “cutting capital spending, preventative services or lower-profile services – could be counterproductive, reducing productivity or increasing pressure on other services”, noting that maintenance backlog costs for schools, the NHS, courts and prisons already stand at £23.7bn. In an interview with the Times, Rishi Sunak warned the public that government “cannot do everything”. The prime minister added: “You have to make sure that as you’re doing things, you’re doing it in a way that’s fair and being honest with people that, of course, no government can fix every problem. Life is not that simple.” The approach of cutting back on capital spending and cancelling tax cuts is the opposite to that of Liz Truss’s government, which was focused on growth at all costs. The Tory MP John Redwood, one of the backers of her economic programme, said on Friday: “I read the government is thinking of cutting investment. It should not cut projects to produce more energy as we are very short of domestic supply. It should cut the massively expensive HS2, where we have plenty of rail capacity for post-Covid demand.” Labour cautioned the government against reneging on the party’s promises to the north of England when it comes to spending on rail projects. Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, accused the government of having “crashed the economy” and then making the north pay for the fallout. “A lost decade of broken Tory promises has left the north with second-rate infrastructure, and rail services in crisis, holding the economy back,” she said. “Rishi Sunak told voters he would deliver Northern Powerhouse Rail, before abandoning it at the first opportunity. This Conservative government have no mandate, no platform and no plan – they crashed the economy, and now they want northern communities to pay the price.” Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, also told the government it would be “shortsighted” not to go ahead with Sizewell C, although Downing Street said this was not in doubt. A senior Treasury source had told the BBC: “We are reviewing every major project – including Sizewell C.” But No 10 and others later said it was not being scrapped or delayed. A government spokesperson said it was “seeking to approve at least one large-scale nuclear project in the next few years”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/17/russia-ukraine-war-un-chief-to-meet-zelenskiy-and-erdogan-in-lviv-for-talks-on-grain-and-nuclear-safety-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T18:09:05Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: at least 12 Russians killed in strike on Nova Kakhovka base, says Ukraine – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/17/russia-ukraine-war-un-chief-to-meet-zelenskiy-and-erdogan-in-lviv-for-talks-on-grain-and-nuclear-safety-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/17/russia-ukraine-war-un-chief-to-meet-zelenskiy-and-erdogan-in-lviv-for-talks-on-grain-and-nuclear-safety-live-news","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: at least 12 Russians killed in strike on Nova Kakhovka base, says Ukraine – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s just after 9pm in Ukraine. Here’s a round-up of all the latest from the conflict. The Ukrainian military said at least 12 Russian were killed in a strike on a base in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka. Footage posted to Telegram by the State Border Guard Service showed numerous burnt-out trucks, collapsed buildings, and debris. Also in occupied southern Ukraine, the mayor of the city of Melitopol said explosions were heard near a Russian command centre. Ivan Fedorov said that a “loud explosion rang out near the enemy’s lair” in the centre of the city. The top official in Russian-annexed Crimea has claimed the FSB security service has broken up what he described as a six-person terrorist cell of a banned Islamist group. It followed a series of strikes on Russian bases and other infrastructure across the region which Russia has sought to blame on “sabotage”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told Ukrainians living in Crimea to avoid Russia military bases following the strikes. “Do not approach the military objects of the Russian army,” he said in his latest video address, adding that they might also explode because of “bungling”. Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov has said that, contrary to Russian claims, Ukraine has not lost any of the Himars rocket launchers provided to it by the US. Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine has received at least 20 of the US-made launchers, and has used them to attack Russian ammunition depots, command posts, and air defences. Russia has repeatedly claimed to have destroyed a number of the systems. The mayor of the village of Verkhnyo Rogachytsk in the Kherson region has been kidnapped, according to the deputy chair of the regional council. Yuri Sobolevsky said Svitlana Ivanivna was taken from her home at around 11am on Tuesday. A Russian soldier has become one of just a handful to speak out publicly against the war in Ukraine. Speaking to the Guardian, Pavel Filatyev, who fled Russia this week after publishing a 141-page account of his time fighting as part of a paratrooper unit, said: “I don’t see justice in this war. I don’t see truth here.” Four more vessels carrying agricultural products have sailed from ports in Ukraine. Turkish state media said the ships departed Odesa and Chernomorsk on Wednesday morning carrying sunflower meal, sunflower oil and corn, it said. They are the latest vessels to leave Ukraine under the terms of a grain export deal agreed between the UN, Ukraine, Turkey and Russia last month. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is in Lviv to review the deal in talks with the Ukrainian and Turkish presidents. The three will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a UN spokesperson said. Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his opposition to a proposal to ban all Russian nationals from the European Union. Asked about the comments, Przydacz said: “[Scholz] did not read all those reports about the enormous support for Vladimir Putin’s policy among ordinary Russians, maybe he did not see all the videos in which people gather with the letter Z.” Russia has appointed a new commander for its Black Sea fleet, according to Russian state media. Vice-Admiral Viktor Sokolov is said to have been presented to a meeting of the fleet’s most senior figures in the Sevastopol in Crimea. The previous commander of the fleet, Igor Osipov, is thought to have been removed following the sinking of its flagship, the Moskva, in April. A Russian soldier has become one of just a handful to speak out publicly against the war in Ukraine. Speaking to the Guardian, Pavel Filatyev said: “I don’t see justice in this war. I don’t see truth here.” Filatyev fled Russia earlier this week after publishing a 141-page document providing a day-by-day account of his time fighting as part of a paratrooper unit. He was eventually evacuated from the conflict after being wounded and contracting an eye infection. He says that, by then, he had decided he needed to expose the rot at the core of the invasion. “We were sitting under artillery fire by Mykolaiv,” he said. “At that point I already thought that we’re just out here doing bullshit, what the fuck do we need this war for? And I really had this thought: ‘God, if I survive, then I’ll do everything that I can to stop this.’” Read the full story here. A key advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has repeated a call for the Crimean Bridge to be destroyed. Writing on Twitter, Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine had never granted permission for the construction of the bridge and that it was an “illegal object”. “It harms the peninsula’s ecology and therefore must be dismantled. Not important how – voluntary or not,” he said. The Crimean Bridge, built following Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, spans the Kerch Strait, connecting the peninsula to mainland Russia. The bridge was closed overnight on Tuesday following a series of strikes on Russian bases and other infrastructure in Crimea. The closure is thought to have come amid fears that it would also be targeted. Speaking to the Guardian this week, Podolyak signalled that Ukraine regarded the bridge as a legitimate military target. “It’s an illegal construction and the main gateway to supply the Russian army in Crimea. Such objects should be destroyed,” he said. Poland’s deputy foreign minister has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his opposition to a proposal to ban all Russian nationals from the European Union. In a press conference in Olso on Monday, Scholz said that this was “not the war of the Russian people, but it is Putin’s war”. Asked about the comments during an appearance on Polish state broadcaster TVP1, Marcin Przydacz said he rejected the idea of “good Russians and a bad tsar”. “[Scholz] did not read all those reports about the enormous support for Vladimir Putin’s policy among ordinary Russians, maybe he did not see all the videos in which people gather with the letter Z,” he said. “Russian society, unfortunately, fed by propaganda for not even the last years, but for decades, hundreds of years, lives in an imperialist dream in which its position would depend on how many territories it seizes, how many countries it conquers.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told Ukrainians living in Crimea to avoid Russia military bases after three strikes on the peninsula in the past week. “Do not approach the military objects of the Russian army,” he said in his latest video address, adding that they might also explode because of “bungling”. Russia has blamed the explosions on “sabotage”, and earlier claimed to have detained six members of an Islamist terror cell. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attacks, but speaking about them to the Guardian a key adviser to the president said that “Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves”. Read the full story here. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is in Lviv ahead of talks with the Ukrainian and Turkish presidents on Thursday. A photo showing Guterres arriving in the city was posted to Twitter by an official UN account. Guterres is set to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Tayyip Erdoğan to review the grain export deal agreed between the UN, Ukraine, Turkey, and Russia last month. The three will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a UN spokesperson said previously. Russia has appointed a new commander for its Black Sea fleet, according to state media agency RIA Novosti. The agency said Vice-Admiral Viktor Sokolov had been presented to a meeting of the fleet’s most senior figures in the Sevastopol in Crimea. It added there was no public event because of what it called the “yellow level of terrorist threat” in the city. The previous commander of the fleet, Igor Osipov, is thought to have been removed following the sinking of its flagship, the Moskva, in April. Solokov previously served as the head of Saint Petersburg’s Kuznetsov Naval Academy, the main staff college for the Russian Navy. Ukraine has not lost any of the Himars rocket launchers provided to it by the US, the Ukrainian defence minister has said. Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine has received at least 20 of the US-made launchers, and has used them to attack Russian ammunition depots, command posts, and air defences. Russia has repeatedly claimed to have destroyed a number of the systems. Himars stands for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System. Speaking to the Ukrainian-language arm of the US outlet Voice of America, Oleksii Reznikov said Ukraine still had all the systems it has been given. The claim was later repeated on the official Twitter account of the country’s defence ministry. The seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by Russia has raised the risk of a nuclear incident at the site, the Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. The area around the plant, situated in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, has been under Russian control since March. The plant remains near the frontline and has been hit by shells multiple times in recent weeks. Speaking at a joint press conference with the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, Stoltenberg said: “The seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by Russian forces poses a serious threat to the safety and the security of this facility, raises the risks of a nuclear accident or incident, and endangers the population of Ukraine, of neighbouring countries, and of the international community. “It is urgent to allow the inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency and to ensure the withdrawal of all Russian forces.” Chinese troops will travel to Russia to take part in joint military exercises led by Russia, China’s defence ministry has said. Last month, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” [East] exercises from 30 August to 5 September, saying that some foreign forces would also participate. China said the exercises would include forces from India, Belarus, Mongolia and Tajikistan. The exercises will be the first conducted by Russia since 2018, when China took part for the first time. The ministry said the exercises were “part of an ongoing bilateral annual cooperation agreement with Russia” and “unrelated to the current international and regional situation”. Four more vessels carrying agricultural products have sailed from ports in Ukraine, according to the Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu. Citing Turkey’s Ministry of National Defence, the agency said the ships departed the ports of Odesa and Chernomorsk on Wednesday morning. They were carrying sunflower meal, sunflower oil and corn, it said. On Tuesday, the first ship to depart Ukraine carrying wheat under the terms of a grain export deal agreed last month docked in Syria. Since 1 August, a total of 21 ships carrying agricultural products have left Ukraine. At least 12 Russians have been killed in a strike on a base in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka, according to the Ukrainian military. Footage posted to Telegram by the State Border Guard Service showed numerous burnt-out trucks, collapsed buildings, and debris. “The base of the occupiers was destroyed in Nova Kakhovka,” the post read. “At least 12 Rashists [supporters of Russian militarism] were liquidated.” A “freeze” of the conflict in Ukraine of the sort that followed the Russian occupation in Donbas is currently not possible, the Ukrainian defence minister has said. Speaking to the Ukrainian-language arm of US outlet Voice of America, Oleksiy Reznikov said: “I don’t think that the option of freezing is possible. “The option of reducing activity is possible, depending on the season. And again, modern war is a war of resources. “Resources, of course, are being depleted on both sides. And, accordingly, each side needs time to recover.” Reznikov also claimed that Russian forces had lost at least a third of their combat capacity since the start of the invasion in February. Russia expects its average price for gas exports to more than double over the course of this year, according to economy ministry forecasts seen by Reuters. The figures suggested that the average price charged by state-owned energy giant Gazprom in 2022 would be $730 (£605) per 1,000 cubic metres, up from $305 (£253) in 2021. Based on those forecasts, the ministry expects Russia to earn $338bn (£280bn) and $256bn (£213bn) from its total energy exports this year and next, respectively, up from $244bn (£202bn) in 2021. The forecast also said that, after this year, prices would gradually fall until the end of 2025. The reduced supply of Russian gas to Europe since the invasion of Ukraine has seen prices surge. Gazprom has said supplies to China are increasing, but Europe remains by far the largest market for Russian gas. Explosions have been heard near a Russian command centre in the occupied city of Melitopol, according to the city’s mayor. Writing on Telegram, Ivan Fedorov said that a “loud explosion rang out near the enemy’s lair” in the centre of the city. “Let me remind you that one of the commandant’s offices of the occupiers is located here,” he said. “The earth will burn under the occupiers - this unshakable truth is proven every day by our soldiers from the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the south of Ukraine.” Melitopol is located in the southern Zaporizhzhia region near Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. Fedorov added that he was still waiting for further details of any losses sustained by Russian forces. Russia has not yet commented on the explosions and the Guardian was not able to independently verify the claims. The top official in Russian-annexed Crimea has claimed the FSB security service has broken up what he described as a six-person terrorist cell of a banned Islamist group. It comes a day after a series of strikes in the region destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase. “All of them are detained. The activities of the terrorists were coordinated, as one would expect, from the territory of the terrorist state of Ukraine,” said Sergei Aksyonov on Telegram. He claimed the detainees were members of Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is banned in Russia. Russia earlier said the strikes had been carried out by saboteurs. The attack followed similar strikes last week on a Russian military base in Crimea, with satellite images showing around nine warplanes had been damaged or destroyed. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attacks, but speaking about them to the Guardian a key adviser to President Zelenskiy said that “Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves”. The mayor of the village of Verkhnyo Rogachytsk in the Kherson region has been kidnapped, the deputy chair of the regional council has said. Writing on Telegram, Yuri Sobolevsky said Svitlana Ivanivna was taken from her home at around 11am on Tuesday. He said it was not known where she had been taken, though speculated it would be the nearby port city of Kakhovka. “She rejected all offers to cooperate with the orcs,” he added. It is just past 1pm in Ukraine. Here is what you may have missed: Russian military leaders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” about security in Crimea after reported explosions yesterday, a British intelligence update said. Posting on Twitter, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that both Russian and Ukrainian authorities admitted that an ammunition dump exploded on Tuesday near Dzhankoi in the north of the region and that a nearby railway and sub-station were also damaged. The update said that the Russian media also reported smoke rising near the Gvardeyskoye Airbase. And while the “the cause of these incidents and the extent of the damage is not yet clear”, Russian commanders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” with security in the region that Russia annexed in 2014. In the Donetsk region at the forefront of the Russian offensive, two civilians were killed and seven others were wounded by recent Russian shelling of several towns and villages. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, confirmed the latest casualties on Telegram. The area has been the subject of heavy shelling by the Russian military in recent weeks as they try to make tactical advances in the Donbas region. A recreation centre has been destroyed and three people injured after Russian shelling in Odesa, a top official has said. Sergey Bratchuk, a representative of the Odessa military administration, said a fire broke out and nearby buildings were damaged after the attack. In a post on the Telegram messaging app he said the damage was caused by two enemy rockets. A rescue operation is continuing, he added. Mayor of Lviv Andriy Sadovyi has warned residents in the western city to prepare for a tough winter. In a video posted to his social media accounts, he said: “It’s likely that we’re in for a difficult winter. It’s logical - there can’t be anything simple in a country that fights for its independence. But we have to be prepared for everything.” He added that the city’s authorities have worked on an action plan for any emergencies “that may arise as a result of an enemy attack.” Ukraine has hinted it was behind a series of mysterious and devastating strikes in occupied Crimea that destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase. Several explosions on Tuesday appeared to have destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an electricity substation about 125 miles (200km) from the frontline with Ukrainian forces. Russia blamed saboteurs for orchestrating the series of explosions. There could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to the strikes in Crimea, a key adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine is engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday. UN secretary-general António Guterres, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. Ukraine’s nuclear operator reported what it called an “unprecedented” cyberattack on its website, but said its operations have not been disrupted. “On August 16, 2022, the most powerful cyberattack since the start of the Russian invasion occurred against Energoatom’s website,” the operator said, adding it “was attacked from Russian territory”. North Korea and the Russian-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine will develop “equally beneficial bilateral cooperation”, Donetsk leader Denis Pushilin said in a letter to Kim Jong Un, North Korean state media reported on Wednesday. The first ship to depart Ukraine under a grain export deal docked in Syria on Tuesday, according to a shipping source and satellite data. Another ship carrying the first cargo of food aid bound for Africa also left Ukraine’s ports. Russia’s defence ministry has warned Britain against a planned spy plane flight over Russian territory, saying its air force has been given orders to prevent an intrusion. The ministry said the UK sent a notice informing about a planned flight of an RC-135 reconnaissance plane along a route that partly passes over Russian territory. “We regard this action as a deliberate provocation,” the ministry said. Estonian authorities removed a Soviet-era tank from its pedestal in the eastern city of Narva, the most significant removal yet out of an estimated 200 to 400 such monuments that the government has pledged to take down by the end of the year. “No one wants to see our militant and hostile neighbour foment tensions in our home,” prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said on Tuesday. Estonia will also this week close its border to more than 50,000 Russians with previously issued visas. Finland announced it will cut the number of visas it issues to Russians to 10% of current volumes from 1 September after Russian tourists begun using the country as a gateway to European holiday destinations. Finland will also join the Baltic states in jointly proposing the discontinuation of an EU visa facilitation agreement with Russia that makes it easier and cheaper for Russians to travel to and within the EU, foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said. Donald McRae interviews Ukrainian heavyweight boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk as he prepares to face Britain’s Anthony Joshua in a rematch on Saturday: It was the day she turned 12 and so of course she cried a bit,” Oleksandr Usyk says quietly as he remembers how his daughter Yelizaveta’s birthday was overshadowed earlier this year, on 24 February, the day that Russia invaded Ukraine. The world heavyweight champion runs his hand through his damp hair, which is cut in the style of a Cossack warrior, and for a moment it feels as if he is back home on that terrible winter morning when the first bombs rained down. “My wife spoke to her, explaining what had happened, and soon my daughter understood very well what we are all facing in Ukraine,” Usyk says. “It was difficult but she got it and the main thing is that she is safe now. She will be OK.” On a ferociously hot Saturday evening for him in Dubai, almost six months since that abandoned birthday party, the ominous shadow of war still hangs over Usyk as he prepares to defend his IBF, WBA and WBO titles against Anthony Joshua. This coming Saturday night in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Usyk and Joshua will step into the ring for their fascinating rematch.

Dan Sabbagh and Luke Harding report for us from Kyiv: Ukraine is engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories, according to a key adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Mykhailo Podolyak told the Guardian there could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to Tuesday’s mysterious strikes on a railway junction and an airbase in Crimea, as well as last week’s hit on Russian warplanes at the peninsula’s Saky aerodrome. Russia said a fire on Tuesday had set off explosions at a munitions depot in the Dzhankoi district of Crimea – an incident that Podolyak said was a reminder that “Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves”.

Denis Pushilin made the pledge in a message congratulating Kim on the 15 August Korean liberation day, North Korean state news agency KCNA reported, two days after reporting a similar message from Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to Kim. “The people of the Donbas region, too, are fighting to regain their freedom and justice of history today just as the Korean people did 77 years ago,” the report cited Pushilin’s letter as saying. “The message expressed the conviction that an equally beneficial bilateral cooperation agreeing with the interests of the peoples of the two countries will be achieved between the People’s Republic of Donetsk and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” KCNA added, using the official name of North Korea.

Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesperson for the Odesa regional administration, reported that Russian forces launched several missiles at the region, injuring three. Ukraine’s armed forces also provided an update, saying the missiles destroyed a recreation centre and several private buildings. A comparison of satellite images taken by US company Planet Labs shows the aftermath of Tuesday’s explosions at a Russian ammunition depot in Crimea. Kirill Ovsyany, a journalist from the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty, posted the images to Twitter.

Pushilin has previously said he hoped for “fruitful cooperation” and increased trade with North Korea. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, 20,500 Jewish people are believed to have emigrated from Russia, according to Israeli Jewish agency Sokhnut. The agency said around 165,000 people of Jewish origin lived in Russia before the Russian invasion, as cited by the BBC. Moscow’s chief Rabbi, Pinchas Goldschmidt, resigned from the position on 6 July, a role he held for almost 30 years. Two weeks after the start of the war, Goldschmidt and his family left Russia, first going to Hungary and then to Israel. He then resigned and opposed the war with Ukraine. I felt that I had to do something to show that I had nothing to do with and did not agree with the invasion of Ukraine. But if I had done this while I was staying in Moscow, I would have put myself in danger,” Goldschmidt said. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, will travel to Ukraine to meet its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Turkish president, Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday, it has been announced. The leaders will review the UN-backed grain export deal and discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” as well as the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Lviv in western Ukraine. On Friday, Guterres will visit the Black Sea port of Odesa, where grain exports have resumed. On Saturday, the top UN official will visit the Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul, which is made up of Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN. officials overseeing the Black Sea exports of Ukraine grain and fertiliser. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, will travel to Ukraine to meet its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Turkish president, Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday. The leaders will review the UN-backed grain export deal and discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” as well as the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is 7.30am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Ukraine has hinted it was behind a series of mysterious and devastating strikes in occupied Crimea that destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase. Several explosions on Tuesday appeared to have destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an electricity substation about 125 miles (200km) from the frontline with Ukrainian forces. Russia blamed saboteurs for orchestrating the series of explosions. There could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to the strikes in Crimea, a key adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine is engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday. UN secretary-general António Guterres, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. Ukraine’s nuclear operator reported what it called an “unprecedented” cyberattack on its website, but said its operations have not been disrupted. “On August 16, 2022, the most powerful cyberattack since the start of the Russian invasion occurred against Energoatom’s website,” the operator said, adding it “was attacked from Russian territory”. North Korea and the Russian-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine will develop “equally beneficial bilateral cooperation”, Donetsk leader Denis Pushilin said in a letter to Kim Jong Un, North Korean state media reported on Wednesday. The first ship to depart Ukraine under a grain export deal docked in Syria on Tuesday, according to a shipping source and satellite data. Another ship carrying the first cargo of food aid bound for Africa also left Ukraine’s ports. Russia’s defence ministry has warned Britain against a planned spy plane flight over Russian territory, saying its air force has been given orders to prevent an intrusion. The ministry said the UK sent a notice informing about a planned flight of an RC-135 reconnaissance plane along a route that partly passes over Russian territory. “We regard this action as a deliberate provocation,” the ministry said. Estonian authorities removed a Soviet-era tank from its pedestal in the eastern city of Narva, the most significant removal yet out of an estimated 200 to 400 such monuments that the government has pledged to take down by the end of the year. “No one wants to see our militant and hostile neighbour foment tensions in our home,” prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said on Tuesday. Estonia will also this week close its border to more than 50,000 Russians with previously issued visas. Finland announced it will cut the number of visas it issues to Russians to 10% of current volumes from 1 September after Russian tourists begun using the country as a gateway to European holiday destinations. Finland will also join the Baltic states in jointly proposing the discontinuation of an EU visa facilitation agreement with Russia that makes it easier and cheaper for Russians to travel to and within the EU, foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/17/zelenskiy-urges-west-speed-up-arms-support-ukraine-russia-offensive","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-17T18:08:07Z","webTitle":" Zelenskiy urges west to speed up arms support to head off Russia offensive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/17/zelenskiy-urges-west-speed-up-arms-support-ukraine-russia-offensive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/17/zelenskiy-urges-west-speed-up-arms-support-ukraine-russia-offensive","fields":{"headline":" Zelenskiy urges west to speed up arms support to head off Russia offensive","bodyText":"The west needs to hurry up its support for Ukraine as Vladimir Putin will gain a military advantage unless arms deliveries and further sanctions arrive soon, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in a video address to world leaders at a security conference in Munich in the face of mounting fears that Russia is planning a new offensive. “We need to hurry up. We need speed – speed of our agreements, speed of our delivery … speed of decisions to limit Russian potential,” the Ukrainian president said. “There is no alternative to speed because it is speed that life depends on.” He added: “Delay has always been and still is a mistake”. His address came just days before the anniversary on 24 February of Moscow sending its forces into the country and unleashing the biggest war in Europe since the 1940s. Zelenskiy accepted Russia was trying to mount an offensive, mainly in the south, partly by attacking civilian and energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, he said, neighbouring Belarus would make a mistake of historic proportions if it joined in the Russian offensive, and claimed surveys showed 80% of the country did not wish to join the war. Trying to sound an optimistic note and taking up the theme of the conference, “David on the Dnipro”, Zelenskiy said his country had the courage to defeat Goliath with a slingshot. But for this to succeed, he said, the slingshot had to become stronger and faster. “Goliath has already started to lose. Goliath will definitely fall this year,” he said. He said since he last spoke to the MSC he had proven that his country could regain lost territory, including 1,000 cities and villages, but took a swipe at the western countries that had only sent weapons to Ukraine after it had been invaded by Russia. He warned that possible consequences of delay could be a Russian invasion of Moldova, or Russia’s ally Iran receiving enriched uranium. Speaking immediately afterwards, however, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, gave Zelenskiy an indirect rebuff, saying caution was better than hasty decisions and unity was better than going it alone. Scholz said Europe was in uncharted territory and there was “no blueprint for confronting a nuclear power waging an imperialist war of aggression here on European soil”. That made it vital to avoid an unintended escalation, requiring carefully weighed decisions. More than 100 world leaders and diplomats, including the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, are attending the Munich security conference, and from the opening speeches it was clear Europe is now expecting a prolonged conflict requiring further expense and sanctions. Scholz said he was the biggest supplier of weapons in continental Europe, and turned the tables on some of his critics, pointing out he had provided German Leopard tanks, but few others had done so. “All those who can supply main battle tanks should really do so,” he said. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France was ready for a prolonged conflict and that “we must collectively be credible in our ability to last in this effort”. He urged allies to support Ukraine to launch a counteroffensive, “which alone can allow credible negotiations, determined by Ukraine, its authorities and its people”. However, he returned to a theme that has previously alienated some supporters of Ukraine, saying: “This is a war that is a consequence of the fact that no one properly digested the end of the cold war – neither Europe nor Russia.” Saying he was not justifying Russia’s illegal actions, he said the west had assumed Russia could change overnight, while the deep reason for its aggression was resentment of what had happened to the Soviet Union and its obsession with the end of empire. Macron admitted the world’s response to war showed the need to rebalance the the global order and make it more inclusive. “I am struck by how we have lost the trust of the global south he said. He advised Russia to move away from neo-imperialism. He added: “No one can change geography. Russia is part of Europe. No one can solve this dilemma. There is no long-term peace in our continent until this problem is solved reasonably.” In his address on Saturday, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will say now is the time to double down on military support for Ukraine, including advanced Nato standard capabilities that the country will need for the future. The war, he is due to say, is not about just Ukraine, “but the security and sovereignty of every nation”. The UK is due to mark the first anniversary of invasion next Friday by holding a national minute’s silence. The Munich security conference has had a tradition going back decades of inviting senior leaders from states hostile, or ambivalent, towards the west, but has this year taken the unusual decision to exclude any representatives from Iran or Russia. Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, responded to his exclusion by setting a Moscow foreign policy goal of ending what he said was the west’s diplomatic monopoly. The Kremlin on Friday accused the US of inciting Ukraine to escalate the war by condoning attacks on Crimea, saying Washington was now directly involved in the conflict because “crazy people” had dreams of defeating Russia. The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, is due to give an address at the conference and his speech will be watched closely to see how far he is willing to go, in distancing himself from Russia’s invasion, and in seeking out a new, post-Covid trading relationship with the west. He is expected to meet the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who is likely to urge him to do more to criticise the invasion of Ukrainian sovereign territory. A planned trip by Blinken to Beijing was cancelled earlier this month over the Chinese spy balloon controversy. The world leaders at Munich will go through a lightning round of bilateral meetings, including talks between Harris and Sunak. It is the second year in a row that the US vice-president has been given the chance to showcase her international diplomatic skills at the Munich conference, which used to be a natural venue for the president, Joe Biden, when he was chair of the Senate foreign affairs committee. European leaders will be using the weekend to speak to the newly elected Republican leadership of the House of Representatives. It is expected that G7 foreign ministers will also meet on the sidelines of the conference on Saturday to discuss next steps in Ukraine and how to address the future of the Iran nuclear deal. Biden is due in Poland on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/13/french-ministers-urge-totalenergies-to-raise-wages-as-strikes-continue","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T14:47:03Z","webTitle":"French ministers urge oil giant to raise wages as strikes continue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/13/french-ministers-urge-totalenergies-to-raise-wages-as-strikes-continue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/13/french-ministers-urge-totalenergies-to-raise-wages-as-strikes-continue","fields":{"headline":"French ministers urge oil giant to raise wages as strikes continue","bodyText":"France has told the oil giant TotalEnergies it has a duty to raise wages, as the group’s two-week standoff with striking workers drags on, disrupting petrol supplies and causing a crisis for the government. Oil depot and refinery strikes at the French group and the US group ExxonMobil have reduced France’s petrol output by more than 60% in recent days, with one in three petrol stations struggling for fuel. Industrial action spread this week to other energy companies including the nuclear power group EDF, where some workers resumed their sporadic industrial action of recent months. Although the picket line was lifted at a key ExxonMobil refinery at Fos-sur-Mer in the south of France on Thursday afternoon after a pay deal was struck, the leftwing CGT trade union at TotalEnergies voted to continue to blockade five sites across the country. At the heart of the standoff is anger at the cost of living crisis and rising inflation, as the trade union demands that workers should have a share of oil companies’ high profits. The government is under fire from political critics for failing to grasp the seriousness of the strike action for higher salaries, which began last month. TotalEnergies’ bumper profits had caused widespread anger, leading to calls for the group to face a windfall tax. The government has consistently refused, taking the line that companies would redistribute their gains among workers voluntarily. The CGT trade union is seeking an immediate 10% pay rise to help staff struggling with the cost of living, and after a surge in energy prices led to huge profits that allowed the company to pay out an estimated €8bn in dividends and an additional special dividend to investors. Like other major oil companies, TotalEnergies’ profits soared as energy prices rose after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, significantly changed tone on Thursday, saying TotalEnergies had an obligation to raise salaries. He told RTL radio: “If one knows the profits which they made … companies which have the capacity have a duty to raise wages, and Total is one of them”. The French energy minister, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, said: “Total needs to raise salaries.” TotalEnergies then told AFP news agency that it would propose a 6% raise for next year, which was below the CGT’s demand for an immediate 10% retroactive to 1 January 2022. The CGT coordinator at the company, Eric Sellini, responded: “We’re not going to negotiate through the media.” TotalEnergies also proposed giving an “exceptional bonus” to all its workers worldwide, equivalent to a month’s salary. It invited all trade unions to pay talks which would begin late on Thursday night. The government pushed on with the rare and controversial measure of ordering certain refinery staff back to work, targeting the picket line at TotalEnergies for the first time at Dunkirk. “Police came to their homes and made them sign a paper ordering that they come work this afternoon from 2pm until 6am tomorrow,” the FO trade union official at the Dunkirk site, Clement Mortier, told AFP news agency. The CGT trade union has launched a legal challenge after several workers were requisitioned at another site in northern France on Wednesday. The crisis is seen as damaging for the government amid long and angry tailbacks at petrol stations and fears of empty tanks among some workers including care assistants to elderly people, who depend on their cars, as well as hauliers and refrigerated lorries for food deliveries. In northern France, which has been badly affected, some school transport had to stop. The office of the prime minister, Élisabeth’s Borne, cited a “real economic threat” for much of northern France, which relies heavily on agriculture, fishing and industry. The CGT trade union said it would push for extending the strike to other sectors, potentially with a broader strike next Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-warns-of-new-missile-attacks-russia-may-be-preparing-to-leave-zaporizhzhia-plant-nuclear-chief-says","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T19:00:08Z","webTitle":"Ukraine braced for new Russian missile strikes targeting power grid as sporadic shelling of cities continues – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-warns-of-new-missile-attacks-russia-may-be-preparing-to-leave-zaporizhzhia-plant-nuclear-chief-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-warns-of-new-missile-attacks-russia-may-be-preparing-to-leave-zaporizhzhia-plant-nuclear-chief-says","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine braced for new Russian missile strikes targeting power grid as sporadic shelling of cities continues – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut has descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily. As Russia moved fresh formations to the area in recent weeks, neither Russian or Ukrainian forces were able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting Russian forces continue to shell residential infrastructure and housing in the recently liberated city of Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military. In its latest update, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Russian troops were digging trenches and fortifying their positions in preparation for a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive in eastern Kherson. Russians are sporadically shelling cities with no apparent strategic aim other than to cause casualties. The Guardian visited a residential district in Dnipro, where a series of houses were destroyed by a fragmentation warhead, designed to inflict maximum casualties, which had landed on Saturday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed Russia will soon launch a series of new missile strikes on his country, warning his defence forces and citizens to prepare for the attack. He gave the ominous caution in his Sunday evening address. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has warned that Russia will probably continue to attack Ukraine’s power grid, gas infrastructure and basic services. He said Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, was trying to use “the winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine”. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office has said 329 children are currently considered missing in Ukraine, while 12,034 have been deported to Russia. According to the Ukrainian government’s children of war portal, 440 children have been killed as a result of Russia’s war and 851 children are now reported as injured. Russia has “unilaterally postponed” talks with the US aimed at resuming nuclear weapons inspections in Cairo this week, a US state department spokesperson confirmed. Talks between US and Russian officials were scheduled to begin tomorrow. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed in a statement that talks would no longer take place this week. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. The Kremlin has denied the reports. Foreign ministers of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden visited Kyiv today to show support for Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, vowed that Ukraine would win despite Russia’s “barbaric brutality”. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine’s prime minister, has visited Downing Street during her visit to London to discuss the prevention of sexual violence in conflicts. Zelenska met with Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, and prime minister Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty. Russia’s foreign ministry said it has summoned the Norwegian ambassador after a number of Russian citizens were arrested over the use of drones. Nearly a dozen Russians have been arrested in Norway in recent weeks or violating the flight ban or the ban on photographing sites deemed sensitive. The arrests, which Russia has described as “politically motivated” and Norway said were legal, comes as Oslo has heightened security following suspected sabotage on the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said: It was noted that the sentences against the Russians were politically motivated and had nothing to do with the principles of fair and impartial justice. A spokesperson for Norway’s foreign ministry, Lars Gjemble, said after the summoning: Our ambassador took the opportunity to inform [Russia] of Norwegian legislation on sanctions. He added: He also reviewed the cases that are currently being processed in Norwegian courts. The meeting was held in a good tone Russia has launched more than 16,000 missile attacks at Ukraine since the war began, 97% of which were civilian targets, according to Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov. The mayor of Mykolaiv, Oleksandr Sienkievych, has said there will be no drinking water supply to the southern Ukrainian city after Russian forces damaged a pumping station in the neighbouring Kherson region. In a post to Telegram, he said: During a missile attack, Russian terrorists damaged a pumping station of MKP Mykolaivvodokanal, located in the Kherson region. Therefore, for an indefinite period of time, we are forced to supply technical water to the city from the Bug estuary. He said the city’s water supply had been repaired just one week after Kherson was liberated by Ukrainian troops, adding: But we are dealing with real terrorists who are powerless against our military, and therefore they fight with the civilian population. He said repair work continued on networks that were destroyed by salt water. As soon as the security situation allows, we will promptly restore the pumping station and return drinking water to Mykolaiv. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has met Olena Zelenska during her visit to London to discuss the prevention of sexual violence in conflicts. Cleverly tweeted a photo of the pair, and praised Zelenska’s efforts to highlight the “horrific use of sexual violence by Russian forces”. He added: The UK stands with Ukraine, and with all survivors of these despicable crimes. The Ukrainian first lady shared a video of the pair meeting earlier this afternoon, expressing “gratitude” to Cleverly for his support of Ukraine. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine’s prime minister, has visited Downing Street during her visit to London to discuss the prevention of sexual violence in conflicts. Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, welcomed Zelenska on the pavement outside No 10 Downing Street as the pair exchanged a hug before walking inside the building. Downing Street said Sunak briefly dropped into the meeting between his wife and Zelenska. Zelenska is expected to address MPs and peers tomorrow as part of her visit to London, where she also took part in an international conference on preventing sexual violence during conflicts. At the conference, Zelenska spoke about sexual violence being perpetrated “systematically and openly” as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues. She said: Sexual violence is the most cruel, most animalistic way to prove mastership over someone. And for victims of this kind of violence, it is difficult to testify in war times because nobody feels safe. This is another instrument that they’re using as their weaponry. This is another weapon in their arsenal in this war and conflict. Russian servicemen were “very open” about using sexual violence as their weaponry, she said. She added: That’s why it’s extremely important to recognise this as a war crime and to hold all of the perpetrators accountable. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has warned that Russia will probably continue to attack Ukraine’s power grid, gas infrastructure and basic services. Speaking to reporters in Bucharest ahead of a two-day meeting of Nato foreign ministers, he said: Doing that when we enter winter demonstrates that President (Vladimir) Putin is now trying to use ... the winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine. In his Sunday night address, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned Ukrainians to prepare for a series of new Russian missile strikes on the country. He said: We understand that terrorists are preparing new strikes. We know that for sure. And as long as they have missiles, they won’t stop, unfortunately.” Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut has descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily, as neither Russian or Ukrainian forces were able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting. As Russia moved fresh formations to the area in recent weeks, including reinforcements previously in the Kherson region, the fighting in the Bakhmut sector has descended into trench warfare reminiscent of the first world war. Over the weekend, images emerged of Ukrainian soldiers in flooded, muddy trenches and battlefields dotted with the stumps of trees cut down by withering artillery barrages. Heavy fighting continued on Monday around Soledar, with mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner private military corporation – which includes pardoned convicts – in the forefront. Ukraine’s presidential office said on Monday that at least four civilians had been killed and 11 others wounded in the latest Russian attacks. It said intense fighting was continuing along the frontline in the east, with the Russians shelling Bakhmut and Toretsk at the epicentre of the fighting. “People are sheltering in the basements, many of which are filled by water,” said the governor of Donetsk, Pavlo Kyrylenko. They have been living in catastrophic conditions without power or heating. The focus of much of the recent fighting, however, has been the now-shattered town of Bakhmut itself, largely abandoned by its 70,000 residents, with both sides sending reinforcements for a battle that has continued relentlessly since the summer as Moscow has sought to secure a victory after a series of battlefield setbacks and retreats. Read the full story here: It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces are continuing to shell residential infrastructure and housing in the recently liberated city of Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military.

Talks between US and Russian officials were scheduled to begin tomorrow. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed in a statement that talks would no longer take place this week. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar, home to the facility, has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. The Kremlin has denied the reports. Foreign ministers of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden are in Kyiv today to show support for Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, vowed that Ukraine would win despite Russia’s “barbaric brutality”. The US has put forward a “significant” proposal for a deal to free the jailed basketball star Brittney Griner and former marine Paul Whelan, the chargée d’affaires of the US mission to Russia, Elizabeth Rood, said. She told Russia’s state-owned RIA news agency that Moscow had not provided a “serious response” to any of its proposals. The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted on to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Ukraine is bracing for another mass missile attack this week, but in between these major salvos aimed at the power grid, the Russians are sporadically shelling cities with no apparent strategic aim other than to cause casualties. In a district of small detached houses in Dnipro, the Reva family were sifting through the wreckage of their home today. The house and four others around it had been destroyed by a shell or missile which had landed on Saturday, but the ruins burned right through Sunday and this was the first time they could get close. It was a fragmentation warhead, designed to inflict maximum casualties, peppering surviving walls with shrapnel and leaving two centimetre diameter holes in metal girders. The bomb fell close to a church and a school, blowing out all its windows, but amazingly no one was killed. Vladyslav Reva does not usually work on a Saturday but had been called out to work by a client of his construction business. “I was saved by God and my client,” he said. His wife, Iryna, had been in the study when the bomb landed and the roof caught fire. She was trying to escape when the blast from their exploding gas heater blew her through a window. She is in hospital with concussion and heavy bruising. The only death was the family dog, a 8 year-old American Akita called June, who has been buried in a corner of the charred garden. Vladyslav Leva showed us a picture of the house before destruction, a handsome two-storey home painted a cheerful yellow and landscaped with a line of trees. His son Oleksii said that it was now past salvaging. “We’re not going to rebuild it,” he said. “We’re going to use a bulldozer and destroy it and then start again somewhere else.” Could the Russian aim of such shelling be to demoralise the population? “Well, they failed,” Oleksii said quickly. “Just the opposite,” his father said, and pointing to the charred ruins of his home, he added: “Better this than Russkiy Mir, Russia’s world.” A US State department spokesperson has confirmed that Russia “unilaterally postponed” talks aimed at resuming nuclear weapons inspections in Cairo this week. Talks between US and Russian officials were scheduled to begin tomorrow. The spokesperson said: The United States and the Russian Federation were set to convene a meeting of the New START Treaty’s Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) in Cairo, Egypt, to discuss New START Treaty implementation on Tuesday, November 29. The Russian side informed the United States that Russia has unilaterally postponed the meeting and stated that it would propose new dates. Washington “is ready to reschedule at the earliest possible date” the meeting “as resuming inspections is a priority for sustaining the treaty as an instrument of stability”, the spokesperson added.

Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the Norwegian ambassador over what it said was the politically motivated arrest of Russian citizens for reportedly using drones illegally. “It was noted that the sentences against the Russians were politically motivated and had nothing to do with the principles of fair and impartial justice,” the ministry said in a statement. Several Russian citizens have reportedly been arrested by Norwegian authorities for flying drones near the Arctic border between the two countries or taking photos of classified facilities, as Norway boosts security after suspected sabotage on the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea. Russia has postponed nuclear disarmament talks with the US planned for this week, according to Kommersant newspaper, citing the US embassy. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed in a statement that talks between Moscow and Washington in Cairo would no longer take place this week. Russian forces are continuing to shell residential infrastructure and housing in the recently liberated city of Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military. A 10-year-old boy was injured and hospitalised after Russian shelling on the town of Chornobayivka in Kherson region, police said. Hundreds of Ukrainians are fleeing Kherson city just two weeks after its recapture from Russian occupying forces. Moscow’s shelling has killed at least 32 civilians since its forces left the city on 9 November. In its latest update published last night, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Russian troops were digging trenches and fortifying their positions in preparation for a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive in eastern Kherson. Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has met his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in a visit to reaffirm historic ties between the two countries. Tokayev’s visit to the Kremlin today marks his first foreign trip since he secured a second term in a snap election last week. Speaking next to Putin before the talks, Tokayev said: This is my first foreign visit after this event and that in itself has political significance and, of course, a certain symbolism. Russia “is and has always been a strategic partner” to Kazakhstan, he added. Putin said relations between Moscow and Astana had a “special character” and called on a strengthening of economic ties. Foreign ministers of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden are in Kyiv today to show support for Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, tweeted about the visit and vowed that Ukraine would win despite Russia’s “barbaric brutality”. Finland’s Pekka Haavisto tweeted about the “inconsolability of war” and expressed admiration for the “courage and determination” of Ukrainians as they “defend their independence”. Anniken Huitfeldt, Norway’s foreign minister, also shared photos of her visit to the capital and said her country stood in solidarity with Ukraine. Here’s more from that interview with Elizabeth Rood, the chargée d’affaires of the US mission to Russia, who discussed the possibility of a follow-up meeting between the CIA’s director, William Burns, and Russian foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin. The pair met in Ankara earlier this month in a rare high-level meeting, following speculation that some senior US figures wanted Ukraine to enter negotiations with the Kremlin to end the war. The US insisted at the time that it was not engaged in secret peace talks with Moscow without Ukrainian officials being present, but that the main purpose of the encounter was to convey “a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia” and to discuss the cases of Americans held in detention in the country. Speaking to Russia’s state-owned RIA news agency, Rood said: The United States has channels for managing risk with the Russian Federation, particularly nuclear risks, and that was the purpose of CIA director Burns’ meeting with his Russian counterpart. Director Burns did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine. I’m sure if there’s a need for another conversation in that channel, it can happen. There’s not anything scheduled that I know of. A senior American diplomat has said the US put forward a “significant” proposal for a deal to free the basketball star Brittney Griner and former marine Paul Whelan, but that Russia had not provided a “serious response” to any of its proposals. Talks between the US and Russia over the two jailed Americans were continuing through the “designated channel”, Elizabeth Rood, the chargée d’affaires of the US mission to Russia, told Russia’s state-owned RIA news agency. She said: The United States, as we have said, has put a significant proposal on the table. We have followed up on that proposal and we have proposed alternatives. Unfortunately, so far the Russian Federation has not provided a serious response to those proposals. Griner was sentenced in August to nine years in a penal colony after being convicted on drug charges. Her lawyers have confirmed that she was taken earlier this month to a penal colony in the Russian region of Mordovia, the same region where Whelan is serving a 16-year sentence after being convicted of espionage charges that he denies. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Moscow hoped to complete a prisoner swap with the US to return the convicted Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Bout, in an exchange that would probably include Griner. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office has said 329 children are currently considered missing in Ukraine, while 12,034 have been deported to Russia. In a statement posted to Telegram, it said: Data on affected children as of November 28, 2022: 329 are missing, 12,034 – deported, and 7,819 – found. It emphasised that the figures were not final as work was still under way to verify reports coming from the frontline, as well as from occupied and liberated parts of Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian government’s children of war portal, 440 children have been killed as a result of Russia’s war and 851 children are now reported as injured. The prosecutor general’s office reports a total of 1,291 children casualties, with the largest number in regions of Donetsk, Kharkiv and Kyiv. It is not possible to independently verify these figures. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest news from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines so far: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed Russia will soon launch a series of new missile strikes on his country, warning his defence forces and citizens to prepare for the attack. He gave the ominous caution in his Sunday evening address. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar, home to the facility, has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted on to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Russia and the US have ways to manage nuclear risks at the level of intelligence agencies, chargée d’affaires of the US embassy in Moscow Elizabeth Rood told Russia’s state news agency Ria Novosti, adding that for now there were no meetings scheduled. The Kremlin’s spokesperson has denied reports that Russian forces were planning to leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, telling reporters they should not look for signs where there were none. The Kremlin said it welcomed a Vatican offer to provide a negotiating platform to resolve the Ukraine conflict, but that Kyiv’s position made this “impossible”. Pope Francis reiterated 10 days ago that the Vatican was ready to do anything possible to mediate and put an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in an interview with the Italian daily La Stampa. The mayor of Kyiv has traded verbal jabs with Zelenskiy and his allies over how to help residents withstand power cuts. Former professional boxer Vitali Klitschko said 430 “warming centres” were helping residents cope with the effects of Russian attacks on power stations, and more than 100 extra centres were planned in case of extreme conditions. Klitschko said Zelenskiy’s allies had engaged in “manipulation” about the city’s efforts. Hundreds of Ukrainians fled Kherson city on Sunday as Russian shelling intensified. The liberation of Kherson earlier this month marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv, but the population has struggled with a lack of water, heating and electricity. Britain will promise to maintain or increase military aid to Ukraine next year, according to an extract of a speech released by the office of the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, which he plans to deliver on Monday. “We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will maintain or increase our military aid next year. And we will provide new support for air defence,” Sunak will reportedly say. The UK will provide Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to Ukraine as part of its latest aid package. “This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian airstrikes of the war. “We have been restoring electricity generation and supply day after day,” Zelenskiy said in his Sunday night address. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s survival may depend on his value to Vladimir Putin as a future bargaining chip, his chief aide has said. Leonid Volkov, speaking on a visit to London, added that Navalny had lost access to his family and was being permanently detained in a “8 by 12ft” cell after being forced into indefinite solitary confinement by Russian authorities last week. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine.

People walk past a destroyed Russian billboard yesterday in Kherson, Ukraine. In case you missed it, hundreds of Ukrainians streamed out of Kherson city on Sunday to flee Russian shelling, two weeks after its recapture from Russian occupying forces prompted jubilant celebrations. The liberation of Kherson marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv – reconquered after the Russians retreated to the east bank of the Dnipro River. However, since then inhabitants have struggled with no water, heating and electricity, because Moscow’s troops destroyed thermal and power plants before they left. Evacuations began last week amid fears that damage to infrastructure caused by the war was too severe for people to endure over Ukraine’s harsh winter. The exodus has been exacerbated by Russian shelling, which has killed 32 civilians since Russian forces left the city on 9 November. “It is sad that we are leaving our home,” Yevhen Yankov told the Associated Press as a van he was in inched forward. “Now we are free, but we have to leave, because there is shelling, and there are dead among the population.” A BM-21 ‘Grad’ multiple rocket launcher fires towards Russian positions on the frontline near Bakhmut, Donetsk region. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar, home to the facility, has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. Petro Kotin, head of Energoatom, said on national television on Sunday: In recent weeks we are effectively receiving information that signs have appeared that they are possibly preparing to leave the [plant]. One gets the impression they’re packing their bags and stealing everything they can.” The Russian backed administration issued a statement in response on the Telegram messaging app on Monday, saying: The media are actively spreading fakes that Russia is allegedly planning to withdraw from Enerhodar and leave the [nuclear plant]. This information is not true.” The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted on to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Boeing’s proposed system, dubbed Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), is one of about a half-dozen plans for getting new munitions into production for Ukraine and America’s eastern European allies, industry sources told the news agency. GLSDB could be delivered as early as spring 2023, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and three people familiar with the plan. It combines the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) with the M26 rocket motor, both of which are common in US inventories. Although a handful of GLSDB units have already been made, there are many logistical obstacles to formal procurement. The Boeing plan requires a price discovery waiver, exempting the contractor from an in-depth review that ensures the Pentagon is getting the best deal possible. Any arrangement would also require at least six suppliers to expedite shipments of their parts and services to produce the weapon quickly. Although the US has rebuffed requests for the 185-mile (297km) range Atacms missile, the GLSDB’s 94-mile (150km) range would allow Ukraine to hit valuable military targets that have been out of reach and help it continue pressing its counterattacks by disrupting Russian rear areas. GLSDB is made jointly by Saab AB and Boeing Co and has been in development since 2019, well before the invasion, which Russia calls a “special operation”. In October, SAAB chief executive Micael Johansson said of the GLSDB: “We are imminently shortly expecting contracts on that.” According to the document – a Boeing proposal to US European – has small, folding wings that allow it to glide more than 100km if dropped from an aircraft and targets as small as 3ft in diameter. Russia and the US have ways to manage nuclear risks at the level of intelligence agencies, chargée d’affaires of the US embassy in Moscow Elizabeth Rood told Russia’s state news agency Ria Novosti, adding that for now there were no meetings scheduled. A video on RIA’s Telegram channel cited Rood as saying: The United States has channels for managing risk with the Russian Federation, particularly nuclear risks and that was the purpose of CIA director Burns’ meeting with his Russian counterpart. Director Burns did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine.” Rood refers to a meeting CIA director William Burns has with Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russian foreign intelligence, earlier this month where he warned him about the consequences of any Russian use of nuclear weapons. Russia said the issues discussed were “sensitive” and declined to comment on them. Rood said if there is need for another conversation in that channel it can happen. “There is not anything scheduled that I know of.” Russia said after Naryshkin’s meeting with Burns that Moscow was open to more high-level talks with the US, but the Kremlin dismissed the idea of a summit between President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden as “out of the question” for now. Officials from the two countries were set to meet in the Egyptian capital of Cairo from 29 November to 6 December to discuss resuming inspections under the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty, although Moscow has played down the prospect of a quick breakthrough. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed Russia will soon launch a series of new missile strikes on his country, warning his defence forces and citizens to prepare for the attack. He gave the ominous caution in his Sunday evening address: We understand that terrorists are preparing new strikes. We know that for sure.

They had spent the past few nights in the basement of the school they worked in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital at the heart of the Russian invasion. The couple and another teacher had 30 minutes to get to the other side of the city. It was their only hope to get out. “I don’t know what the CEO did to get them, but he got us seats on the train and it’s almost impossible. We had 30 minutes to get there,” Lehmann Ware said. “We got there with literally 30 seconds to go. The driver, he was screeching down the streets of Kyiv.” The couple is now safely in Chernivtsi, a city in western Ukraine that is acting as a short-term haven for people trying to cross the border to Romania or Moldova. Lehmann Ware and her husband are from Huonville in Tasmania. They have spent the past five years teaching in different countries – in July last year, they moved to Kyiv and fell in love with the vibrant city. As war rumours swirled, they were reluctant to leave their school community. Just as the Russians were about to advance on the country, the couple caught Covid. “Dfat called us, they asked when were you diagnosed. [We told them] and they went ‘oh shit’. We didn’t have an option. We could not get out because we had Covid.” With their two cats, the pair bunkered down in the school basement with other members of the staff. They planned to leave by car before it became too unsafe. Each night was interrupted with the sound of explosions as Russian missiles were shot down. Some made it through. No one slept. A 64km convoy of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles had just been spotted advancing up the road to the capital. Military analysts said it was poised to attack. They weren’t sure when they would leave the basement, or what state their city would be in when they did. Then the phone rang. “One of our security guards got us out, I can’t even remember what day it was. He’s now in the militia,” Lehmann Ware said. Although the station was packed with people – many of them trying desperately to get out of the city – there was still a sense of community, she said. People wanted to help each other. “I was going through the front door, I had lost my party, I was holding my massive cat, Dexter, and a young man from nowhere came up to me, he could see I was panicked, he said ‘Everything is OK, you’re going to be OK’,” she said. Lehmann Ware found her husband but, at the top of the stairs, they got separated in the crowd. There were people everywhere. He yelled at her to go, so she ran to the train. She got on, and out of the blue, their security guard arrived, almost carrying her husband with him. “He literally had about 30 seconds to get on the train, that was it,” she said. On the train, the windows were blacked out for security. Through a crack she watched as they passed bombed villages. The carriage was filled with women and children who had had to leave their husbands behind. “No Ukrainian men, no men, they have to stay. You have little kids and their mothers travelling alone and getting to a border,” she said. “It ended up being an 18-hour train journey on a very, very, very old train. One of the really old Soviet trains. Eighteen hours and the train is just overloaded, people in the hallways with kids, dogs, cats, most people got out Lviv – that’s a major transport hub.” The pair and their two cats are now safe in a hotel. There’s fresh coffee and stable wifi. Back home her parents and 21-year-old daughter are finally sleeping with their phones on silent. Everyone is in shock. “My God I’m exhausted. At the moment, to be honest, I think those of us who are here are suffering from survivors’ guilt. You’re happy you’re here and safe but terrified for the people you’ve left behind. “One of my assistant teachers, I haven’t heard from her since Friday. I feel bad for not being there with them.” In the first seven days of the war, one million people fled Ukraine. UN high commissioner for refugees Filippo Grandi said that in 40 years of working in refugee emergencies, he had rarely seen an exodus as quick as this one. “Hour by hour, minute by minute, more people are fleeing the terrifying reality of violence. Countless have been displaced inside the country,” he said. The borders are busy and the west of the country is covered in snow – making lining up to get over the border a hard task. “It’s snowing and cold. We’ve got these children lining up for five to 20 hours, however long it’s taking. It’s horrendous,” she said. “Dfat and Australian crisis support group have been amazing. They’re in constant contact and all of them have said they’ll be there ready for us. Lehmann Ware and her husband are still working out what to do – how to get home. “We make a plan it doesn’t work, we just don’t know, we are hoping to get across tomorrow but we just don’t know. “It’s so important the world knows what’s happening here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2020/aug/27/hunterston-scottish-nuclear-power-station-to-shut-down-early-after-reactor-problems","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-27T17:15:43Z","webTitle":"Scottish nuclear power station to shut down early after reactor problems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/27/hunterston-scottish-nuclear-power-station-to-shut-down-early-after-reactor-problems","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2020/aug/27/hunterston-scottish-nuclear-power-station-to-shut-down-early-after-reactor-problems","fields":{"headline":"Scottish nuclear power station to shut down early after reactor problems","bodyText":"Hunterston nuclear power station, one of the UK’s oldest remaining nuclear plants, is to close down next year, earlier than expected, after encountering a series of safety-critical problems in its reactors. Industry sources told the Guardian that EDF Energy, the state-owned French operator of Hunterston, decided at a board meeting on Thursday afternoon that the plant would stop generating electricity in late 2021, at least two years earlier than planned. The energy company had hoped to keep generating electricity from the 44-year-old nuclear plant on the Firth of Clyde until 2023, after ploughing more than £200m into repairing the reactor. Hunterston, which first began generating electricity in 1976, has been offline since 2018 after inspectors discovered 350 microscopic cracks in the reactor’s graphite core. In October last year the Ferret, an investigative website, reported that at least 58 fragments and pieces of debris had fallen off the graphite blocks as the cracks worsened. It quoted the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) as saying this had created “significant uncertainty” about the risks of debris blocking channels for cooling the reactor and causing fuel cladding to melt. After a two-year investigation, the ONR said on Thursday that reactor 3 at Hunterston would be allowed to restart as planned, but it would only be allowed to generate electricity for approximately six months. EDF then plans to apply next spring to extend its life for one final six-month run. EDF said it would begin the process of decommissioning Hunterston no later than the first week of 2022. EDF also operates Scotland’s second nuclear power station, Torness, on the east coast south of Edinburgh. Running since 1988, its two reactors can produce up to 1.2GW of electricity. It is due to remain operational until 2030 at the earliest. Hunterston’s closure has reignited concern over energy policy. Both the UK and Scottish governments aim to increase low-carbon energy supplies to help meet climate goals. Gary Smith, the regional secretary of the union GMB Scotland, said the job losses from the closure “would pose massive long-term challenges for what is quite a deprived area of Scotland. The Scottish government now has a huge problem with its energy policy: more imported gas will be burnt to keep the lights on. Renewables on their own won’t do that.” The Scottish National party government in Edinburgh has an anti-nuclear policy but has backed efforts to extend the life of Hunterston and Torness, while phasing out coal-fired power stations and building up renewable sources in Scotland. In 2016 Scotland’s two nuclear stations produced 43% of its electricity. In 2018, the year Hunterston went offline after the reactor cracks were uncovered, that fell to 28%. Richard Dixon, the director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: “In terms of energy security, clearly there’s no problem. Its reactors haven’t been running and the lights haven’t gone out. What’s more urgent now is to build up renewables and energy efficiency, to make sure the gap left by Hunterston is filled by zero-carbon electricity or energy saving.” Simone Rossi, EDF’s UK chief executive, said the decision to shut the nuclear plant “underlines the urgent need for investment in new, low-carbon nuclear power to help Britain achieve net zero and secure the future for its nuclear industry, supply chain and workers.” Across the UK there are eight operational nuclear power plants, which generate a steady supply of electricity about two-thirds of the time. In total they supplied 18.7% of the UK’s electricity in 2018, down from just over 20% the year before. All but one are due to close within the next decade. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said a nuclear programme would help create “tens of thousands of secure, skilled and well-paid jobs” while helping to meet the UK’s future electricity demand, which is projected to quadruple in the coming decades. EDF said in a letter to the local community this month that it had invested more than £200m in investigating whether Hunterston’s graphite reactor would remain safe under a range of worst-case scenarios, including a one-in-10,000-years seismic event, which is much larger than the UK has ever recorded."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2022/mar/04/bbc-website-blocked-in-russia-as-shortwave-radio-brought-back-to-cover-ukraine-war","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T04:32:39Z","webTitle":"BBC website blocked in Russia as shortwave radio brought back to cover Ukraine war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/04/bbc-website-blocked-in-russia-as-shortwave-radio-brought-back-to-cover-ukraine-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/mar/04/bbc-website-blocked-in-russia-as-shortwave-radio-brought-back-to-cover-ukraine-war","fields":{"headline":"BBC website blocked in Russia as shortwave radio brought back to cover Ukraine war","bodyText":"Access to BBC websites has been restricted in Russia, hours after the corporation brought back its shortwave radio service in Ukraine and Russia to ensure civilians in both countries can access news during the invasion. State communications watchdog Roskomnadzor restricted access to BBC Russia’s online presence, as well as Radio Liberty and the Meduza media outlet, the state-owned Russian RIA news agency reported on Friday. On Friday, Globalcheck, a service that tracks internet censorship in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), reported that the availability of the entire BBC website was at 17% of normal levels in Russia, which suggested some services had been blocked. Later on Friday, the BBC shared methods to circumvent the ban, including the Pisphon app or the Tor browser. BBC Russia also reported that Meta, formerly known as Facebook, also appeared to be blocked, as was Google Play. The signs the BBC was being blocked emerged hours after the BBC’s decision to revert to a mostly obsolete form of broadcasting, broadcasting four hours of its world service, read in English, to Ukraine and parts of Russia each day. “It’s often said truth is the first casualty of war,” BBC director general Tim Davie said in announcing the move on Thursday. “In a conflict where disinformation and propaganda is rife, there is a clear need for factual and independent news people can trust … millions more Russians are turning to the BBC.” The German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle also reported in Russian that the BBC site was not working in Russia. The BBC’s shortwave radio broadcast can be found on 15735 kHz from 4pm to 6pm and on 5875 kHz from 10pm to midnight, Ukraine time. The BBC’s move to bring back shortwave came days after Russia launched two missiles on Kyiv’s TV tower, killing five people and knocking out some access to news and broadcasts. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, wrote on Twitter that the Kremlin was preparing to cut off communications and spread “massive fake messages that the country’s leadership has given up”. Russia has clamped down on public dissent at home, while Kremlin-backed media organisations such as RT have been pulled internationally. The Kremlin has complained about the BBC’s coverage of the invasion, with Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claiming without evidence that the BBC “plays a determined role in undermining the Russian stability and security”. Zakharova also claimed Russia had been the victim of “unprecedented information terrorism” that was “creating hysteria around Ukrainian events”. The BBC has reported huge increases in its audiences in Ukraine and Russia since the invasion began. In the last week of February, viewership of BBC’s Ukrainian language website more than doubled from a year earlier to 3.9 million visitors. Its Russian-language website has reached a record 10.7 million visitors over the past week, more than tripling its weekly 2022 average. Shortwave radio uses frequencies that can travel long distances and are accessible on portable radios, making it the go-to method to reach listeners in conflict zones throughout history. Shortwave was used extensively in Europe to broadcast propaganda during the second world war, and usage peaked during the cold war. But as radio technology developed, along with the mass adoption of online news, shortwave fell out of favour around the world. After 76 years, the BBC World Service ended its shortwave broadcast to Europe in 2008.

Residents of the two southern regions, which were shelled regularly by Russian forces in the past months, have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, said Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. The government would provide transportation, accommodation and medical care, she added. The evacuations come just over a week after Ukraine retook the city of Kherson – which remains close to the frontline – and areas around it. The liberation marked a major battlefield gain, while the evacuations highlight the difficulties Ukraine is facing after heavy Russian shelling of its power infrastructure as winter sets in. The war’s southern front has been the recent focus of efforts for both Russian and Ukrainian forces before Russia’s retreat from Kherson. More recently, however, Moscow appears to be building up forces and increasing its military efforts on the eastern Donbas front where the two sides have been locked in a bitter and inconclusive struggle for months, not least around the key town of Bakhmut. With the Kremlin sending fresh reinforcements to the area, as well as troops previously deployed in the south, the Russian armed forces and the Wagner mercenary group have begun intensifying efforts to break that long and bloody stalemate, with unconfirmed reports of the use of incendiary munitions against Ukrainian positions. Russia has been pounding Ukraine’s power grid and other infrastructure from the air, causing widespread blackouts and leaving millions of Ukrainians without heat, power or water as frigid cold and snow blankets the capital, Kyiv, and other cities. Four-hour or longer power outages were expected in 15 Ukrainian regions on Monday, according to Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the head of the state grid operator, Ukrenergo. More than 40% of Ukraine’s energy facilities were damaged by Russian missile strikes in recent weeks. While the situation in the recently liberated areas of the south led to the evacuations announcement, it is barely better in many other parts of the country. The situation in Kyiv and other major cities has deteriorated drastically after the largest missile attack on the country’s power grid on Tuesday. Ukrenergo said 40% of Ukrainians were experiencing difficulties because of damage to at least 15 major energy hubs across Ukraine. Warning that electricity outages could last anywhere from several hours to several days, it added: “Resilience and courage are what we need this winter.” The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has also stressed the need to be ready and resilient in the face of a potential blackout. “Worst-case scenario. Actually, I don’t like to talk about that, but I have to be prepared if we [do not] have electricity, blackout, no water, no heating, no services and no communication,” he said on Friday. Ukrenergo said: “Thousands of kilometres of key high-voltage lines are not working,” affecting the entire country. News of the evacuations came as a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant had caused widespread damage, but concluded that there were no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns at the Russian-held facility. “They were able to confirm that – despite the severity of the shelling – key equipment remained intact and there were no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns,” the UN agency said in a statement. Repeated shelling of the Zaporizhzhia complex has raised concerns about a grave accident 310 miles (500km) from the site of the world’s worst nuclear power plant accident, at Chernobyl in 1986. The Zaporizhzhia plant provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times. It has six Soviet-designed water-cooled and water-moderated reactors containing uranium-235. The reactors are shut down but there is a risk that nuclear fuel could overheat if the power driving the cooling systems is cut. Heavy fighting continues in Kherson city, where there were a series of explosions on Monday, with one person killed and four others were taken to hospital as a result of shelling, according to the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko. Russia’s forces continue to strengthen defences along the east bank of the Dnipro River and to build up additional defensive lines deep inside Russian-held territory. “Artillery duels continue, the fight continues,” said Dmytro Pletentchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military in the area. “Kherson is now on the frontline.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T17:18:46Z","webTitle":"‘Rampant profiteering’: Unite asks Ofgem to cap power distributors’ profits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","fields":{"headline":"‘Rampant profiteering’: Unite asks Ofgem to cap power distributors’ profits","bodyText":"The companies responsible for bringing electricity to UK homes have been accused of “rampant profiteering” by a leading union that is calling for the energy regulator to cap their earnings. Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, has written to Ofgem to ask it to clamp down on “excessive” profits generated by regional electricity distribution network operators (DNOs), which raked in £15.8bn in profits last year and have paid out £3.6bn in dividends between 2017 and 2021. In the letter to Ofgem, which has been seen by the Guardian, Graham said the six operators have “been holding the public to ransom for too much and for too long” and called for a recent consultation on the amount they could charge energy suppliers, and ultimately consumers, to be reopened. Graham wants Ofgem, which has been condemned for its handling of the energy crisis, to revise its policies to tighten the controls on DNOs. “It is time to set a clear cap on profits to help give consumers confidence that their energy bills are fair and not simply a vehicle for profiteering energy network owners,” she said. Research by Common Wealth, a thinktank, shows that DNOs have higher profit margins than any other sector in the UK, and expects operators to register profit margins of more than 50% in 2022. The thinktank argues that consumers are paying for privatised monopolies to reward their investors. The government has curbed profits on North Sea oil and gas producers and introduced a levy on “excess returns” made by electricity generators including windfarms and nuclear power plants. However, the profits of DNOs – which carry the energy but do not sell it – have not been on the political agenda. Their earnings have not been inflated by high wholesale gas prices, but charges to consumers through network costs have been rising. Ofgem sets price controls on the monopolies’ revenues for five-year periods to ensure that companies run efficient networks and are incentivised to invest in improving them. In 2019, the regulator conceded that the cost to consumers of transmission were “higher than they needed to be” and that profit margins were “towards the higher end of our expectations”. Average households paid £214.35 for gas and electricity distribution in 2021, it said. The current network price controls period ends this April, with the next five-year period beginning after that. Ofgem is due to make its final determinations on the pricing on 30 November after a consultation with the industry, which began before the energy crisis. In her letter to Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, Graham asked for the regulator to reopen the consultation. As part of her call for an earnings cap, she cited the profits of UK Power Networks (UKPN), which distributes power to 8.3m homes and businesses across London, the east and south-east of England. Common Wealth analysis shows the company has made £2.4bn in profits over the past four years. The UK’s largest electricity distributor, which is owned by CK Hutchison, the Hong Kong-based holding company that also owns the port of Felixstowe, has paid out £1bn in dividends to shareholders over the same period. CK bought UKPN for £5.5bn in 2010 and a £15bn sale of the DNO to a consortium collapsed in the summer amid concerns over the price. In the past four years, Northern Powergrid, which has 3.9 million customers in north-east England and Yorkshire, made £1bn in profit, and Electricity North West made £323m, handing out £212m to shareholders. Northern Powergrid did not pay a dividend during the period, but did in 2015 (£100m) and in 2017 (£50m). In her letter, Graham said: “Ofgem is a regulator that doesn’t regulate. Time for that to change. How long must the public pay for profiteering from the likes of UK Power Networks? It’s time to pull the plug on the energy profiteers.” A spokesperson for UKPN said its cost to the customer was £98 on average, “one of the lowest of any UK electricity distributor and falling as a percentage of the overall electricity bill by a proposed 15% in real terms over the period 2023-28”. The company has invested £6.4bn over 11 years in networks, it said. Ofgem said: “We do not believe that it would be in consumers’ interests to delay the implementation of the price control.” A spokesperson for Energy Networks Association, which represents energy network operators, claimed that Unite’s figures were “misleading” and that investment returns were an accurate reflection of profitability. “The network companies are allowed, by Ofgem, to earn around 5% on their investments and the figures being suggested do not reflect the costs associated with these essential investments,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/15/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-173-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T18:15:58Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 173 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-173-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/15/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-173-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 173 of the invasion","bodyText":"At least three civilians have been killed in Russian shelling in the eastern Donetsk oblast. At least three Ukrainian civilians were killed and 13 were wounded in artillery barrages from the Russian military in Donetsk, Ukrainian officials said on Monday. Ukraine says it has struck a base used by the Wagner group, according to reports. Ukraine said it had struck a base used by Russian paramilitary group as well as a bridge near the occupied city of Melitopol , according to reports from AFP. Five people have been injured in Kharkiv after Russian shelling. Two of them are in a serious condition, a top Ukrainian official has said. Putin says Russia is ready to offer allies in Latin America, Asia and Africa “advanced” weapons. Putin used a speech at an arms show near Moscow to boast of Russia’s advanced weapons capabilities and declare its willingness to share technology with like-minded countries. In a letter to Kim Jong-un for Korea’s liberation day, Putin said closer ties would be in both countries’ interests, and would help strengthen the security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the north-east Asian region, North Korea’s KCNA news agency said. The UN has said it can facilitate an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visit to Ukraine’s damaged Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant if Russia and Ukraine agree. A total of 42 countries have called on Russia to immediately withdraw military forces from the plant, including the US, Japan and the UK, plus the EU. The IAEA has warned of a possible nuclear disaster unless fighting stops. On Poland’s Armed Forces Day, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has released a video statement commemorating the national holiday. In the video, he says in Polish: “Today, just like 102 years ago, we once again face a centuries-old enemy together.” The holiday celebrates the anniversary of the 1920 victory over Soviet Russia at the Battle of Warsaw. Kyiv’s mayor has warned of a cold winter for citizens, due to gas shortages. The former boxing champion and mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said he did not want to reassure residents that “everything will be fine” and that there were “harsh realities” in the country. The defence team of the US basketball star Brittney Griner has appealed against her conviction for drugs possession and trafficking, Griner’s lawyer Maria Blagovolina told Reuters on Monday. Griner, who had played for a Russian club, was arrested at a Moscow airport on 17 February after cannabis-infused vape cartridges were found in her luggage. She pleaded guilty to the charges but said she had made an “honest mistake” by entering Russia with cannabis oil, which is illegal in the country. She was convicted on 4 August and jailed for nine years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/15/explosion-in-poland-unlikely-to-spark-escalation-even-if-caused-by-russian-missiles","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-15T23:52:09Z","webTitle":"Poland explosion unlikely to spark escalation – but risks of Nato-Russia clash are real","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/15/explosion-in-poland-unlikely-to-spark-escalation-even-if-caused-by-russian-missiles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/15/explosion-in-poland-unlikely-to-spark-escalation-even-if-caused-by-russian-missiles","fields":{"headline":"Poland explosion unlikely to spark escalation – but risks of Nato-Russia clash are real","bodyText":"If it was a Russian missile that struck a Polish village on Tuesday, killing two people, it would be the first time a Russian weapon has ever come down on Nato territory. The Soviet Union and the US managed to get through the whole cold war without making such a mistake, because Washington and Moscow were well aware of the risks of going to war by accident or miscalculation. Vladimir Putin’s Russia is a far less predictable nuclear power than the Soviet Union, raising the danger level, as Joe Biden has pointed out, to the highest since the Cuban missile crisis. Putin’s intervention in Syria led to a Russian warplane being shot down by a Turkish fighter jet over the Turkish-Syrian border in November 2015, but that incident was contained. Similarly, Tuesday’s missile incident is unlikely to lead to a direct Nato-Russian confrontation. The Polish government has said it is still investigating whose missiles fell on its territory, and the office of President Andrzej Duda has said it is considering invoking article 4 of Nato’s founding treaty, which allows any member to call for urgent consultations of the North Atlantic council “whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened”. Duda spoke to Biden; the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg; and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Tuesday night. Warsaw did not mention article 5 of the treaty, which states that an armed attack on one member is an attack on all, and which would be the most likely mechanism of escalation to a war between Nato and Russia. Article 5 cannot be invoked by just one member state, the former US ambassador to Nato, Ivo Daalder, said, adding it “requires Nato consensus”. The only time it was invoked by the Nato allies was in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and led to the allies providing aerial radar patrols over the US and stepping up naval patrols in the Mediterranean. Even if it was concluded that the missiles that crossed the Polish border were indeed Russian, and not Ukrainian anti-missile interceptors, it would fall short of an “armed attack” envisaged in article 5, argued William Alberque, director of strategy, technology and arms control for International Institute for Strategic Studies. “‘Deliberate armed attack’ is a real thing,” Alberque said. “Two misfired cruise or ballistic missiles ain’t it.” Up to now, the broad Nato consensus has been that Russian escalation would lead to stepped-up arms supplies to Ukraine, and that – rather than any form of direct Nato involvement – would serve as a deterrent to Russian recklessness. That is the most likely response this time, and there will be a debate within Nato on whether it warrants a step up in the sort of military assistance being provided. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, argued it warranted the provision of F-15 and F-16 fighter jets. The Polish border incident has also restored calls for a no-fly zone over western Ukraine enforced by Nato air defences, in particular from Baltic state officials. Advocates of such a move argued that the risks of such a step triggering an all-out war are far lower now than at the start of the full-scale invasion, as Russian forces are currently confined to the far east and south of the country. However, there would be considerable resistance to any such expansion of Nato’s role from the US and other Nato allies. Even though this incident is likely to be contained, it does not mean that risks of a Nato-Russian clash through miscalculation are not real. Kyiv is anxious to bind Nato as closely as possible to the country’s struggle to restore its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that the missiles were a “a strike against our collective security” and a “very serious escalation”. Meanwhile, as the Russian military debacle in Ukraine worsens with the loss of Kherson and surrounding territory, Putin is becoming more desperate and the ultra-hawks who dominate television discourse in Russia are baying for a confrontation to rationalise the humiliation of losing a war to Ukraine. While the defence ministry claimed not to have anything to do with the missiles, Margarita Simonyan, the head of the RT propaganda channel, gloated over the implications of a Russian strike. “If this isn’t a deliberate provocation, there’s one piece of good news here,” Simonyan said on Twitter. “A Nato country is so shitily defended that anyone can accidentally hit it with anything and all of Nato won’t even know who hit it, with what and why.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2021/jun/02/tonights-tv-britains-first-nuclear-reactor-in-20-years","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-02T05:00:33Z","webTitle":"Tonight’s TV: Britain’s first nuclear reactor in 20 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jun/02/tonights-tv-britains-first-nuclear-reactor-in-20-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jun/02/tonights-tv-britains-first-nuclear-reactor-in-20-years","fields":{"headline":"Tonight’s TV: Britain’s first nuclear reactor in 20 years","bodyText":"Building Britain’s Biggest Nuclear Power Station 9pm, BBC Two With an estimated construction cost of between £21.5bn and £22.5bn, the nuclear power plant in question – Hinkley Point C – was one of eight announced by the government in 2010, but the only one on which work has since commenced, meaning it will become the first nuclear power station to have been built in the UK in more than 20 years.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday accused the US itself of spreading disinformation about TikTok’s potential security risks following a report in the Wall Street Journal that the committee on foreign investment in the US – part of the treasury department – was threatening a US ban on the app unless its Chinese owners divest their stake. So are the data security risks real? And should users be worried that the TikTok app will be wiped off their phones? Here’s what to know: What are the concerns about TikTok? Both the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share TikTok user data – such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers – with China’s authoritarian government. A law implemented by China in 2017 requires companies to give the government any personal data relevant to the country’s national security. There’s no evidence that TikTok has turned over such data, but fears abound due to the vast amount of user data it, like other social media companies, collects. Concerns around TikTok were heightened in December when ByteDance said it fired four employees who accessed data on two journalists from BuzzFeed News and the Financial Times while attempting to track down the source of a leaked report about the company. Just last week, the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, told the Senate intelligence committee that TikTok “screams” of national security concerns and that China could also manipulate the algorithm to spread misinformation. “This is a tool that is ultimately within the control of the Chinese government, and to me, it screams out with national security concerns,” Wray said. How is the US responding? The White House national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, declined to comment when asked on Thursday to address the Chinese foreign ministry’s comments about TikTok, citing the review being conducted by the committee on foreign investment. Kirby also could not confirm that the administration sent TikTok a letter warning that the US government may ban the application if its Chinese owners don’t sell its stake but added, “we have legitimate national security concerns with respect to data integrity that we need to observe.” In 2020, then president Donald Trump and his administration sought to force ByteDance to sell off its US assets and ban TikTok from app stores. Courts blocked the effort, and President Joe Biden rescinded Trump’s orders but directed an in-depth study of the issue. A planned sale of TikTok’s US assets was also shelved as the Biden administration negotiated a deal with the app that would address some of the national security concerns. In Congress, US senators Richard Blumenthal and Jerry Moran, a Democrat and a Republican, respectively, wrote a letter in February to the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, urging the committee on foreign investment panel, which she chairs, to “swiftly conclude its investigation and impose strict structural restrictions” between TikTok’s US operations and ByteDance, including potentially separating the companies. At the same time, lawmakers have introduced measures that would expand the Biden administration’s authority to enact a national ban on TikTok. The White House has already backed a Senate proposal that has bipartisan support. How has TikTok already been restricted? On Thursday, British authorities said they were banning TikTok on government-issued phones on security grounds, after similar moves by the EU’s executive branch, which temporarily banned TikTok from employee phones. Denmark and Canada have also announced efforts to block the app on government-issued phones. Last month, the White House said it would give US federal agencies 30 days to delete TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. Congress, the US armed forces and more than half of US states had already banned the app on official devices. What does TikTok say? A TikTok spokesperson, Maureen Shanahan, said the company was already answering security concerns through “transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification”. In June, TikTok said it would route all data from US users to servers controlled by Oracle, the Silicon Valley company it chose as its US tech partner in 2020 in an effort to avoid a nationwide ban. But it is storing backups of the data in its own servers in the US and Singapore. The company said it expects to delete US user data from its own servers, but it has not provided a timeline as to when that would occur. The TikTok CEO, Shou Zi Chew, is will testify next week before the House energy and commerce committee about the company’s privacy and data-security practices, as well as its relationship with the Chinese government. In the lead-up to the hearing, Chew has quietly met with several lawmakers – some of whom remain unmoved by their conversation with the 40-year-old executive. After convening with Chew in February, Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado who previously called on Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, said he remained “fundamentally concerned that TikTok, as a Chinese-owned company, is subject to dictates from the Chinese Communist party”. Meanwhile, TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, has been trying to position itself as more of an international company – and less of a Chinese company that was founded in Beijing in 2012 by its current chief executive, Liang Rubo, and others. Theo Bertram, TikTok’s vice-president of policy in Europe, said in a tweet on Thursday that ByteDance “is not a Chinese company”. Bertram said its ownership consists of 60% global investors, 20% employees and 20% founders. Its leaders are based in cities such as Singapore, New York, Beijing and other metropolitan areas. Are the security risks legitimate? It depends on whom you ask. Some tech privacy advocates say that while the potential abuse of privacy by the Chinese government is concerning, other tech companies have data-harvesting business practices that also exploit user information. “If policymakers want to protect Americans from surveillance, they should advocate for a basic privacy law that bans all companies from collecting so much sensitive data about us in the first place, rather than engaging in what amounts to xenophobic showboating that does exactly nothing to protect anyone,” said Evan Greer, director of the non-profit advocacy group Fight for the Future. Karim Farhat, a researcher with the Internet Governance Project at Georgia Tech, said a TikTok sale would be “completely irrelevant to any of the alleged ‘national security’ threats” and go against “every free market principle and norm” of the state department’s internet freedom principles. Others say there is legitimate reason for concern. People who use TikTok might think they’re not doing anything that would be of interest to a foreign government, but that’s not always the case, said Anton Dahbura, executive director of the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. Important information about the US is not strictly limited to nuclear power plants or military facilities; it extends to other sectors, such as food processing, the finance industry and universities, Dahbura said. Is there precedent for banning tech companies? Last year, the US banned the sale of communications equipment made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, citing risks to national security. But banning the sale of items could be more easily done than banning an app, which is accessed through the web. Such a move might also go to the courts on grounds that it could violate the first amendment as some civil liberties groups have argued."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/08/risk-of-conflict-and-strife-in-europe-over-energy-crisis-eu-deputy-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-08T11:28:17Z","webTitle":"Risk of ‘conflict and strife’ in Europe over energy crisis, EU deputy warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/08/risk-of-conflict-and-strife-in-europe-over-energy-crisis-eu-deputy-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/08/risk-of-conflict-and-strife-in-europe-over-energy-crisis-eu-deputy-warns","fields":{"headline":"Risk of ‘conflict and strife’ in Europe over energy crisis, EU deputy warns","bodyText":"Europe is in danger of highly damaging “very, very strong conflict and strife” this winter over high energy prices, and should make a short-term return to fossil fuels to head off the threat of civil unrest, the vice-president of the European Commission has warned. Frans Timmermans, the second most senior official in the EU, said the threat of unrest this winter, a deliberate outcome of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, must take precedence over the climate crisis. He said: “If our society descends into very, very strong conflict and strife because there is no energy, we’re certainly not going to make our [climate] goals. We’re certainly not going to get where we need to get if the lack of energy leads to strong disruption in our societies, and we need to make sure people are not in the cold in the coming winter. “We need to make sure we keep our industry, as much as possible, functioning because the one thing that could help Putin is divisions in our society.” People suffering from the cold this winter because they cannot afford heating would also be disastrous for solving the climate crisis, Timmermans argued in an interview with the Guardian in Brussels. “I’ve been in politics long enough, over 30 years, to understand that people worry most about the immediate crisis and not about the long-term crisis And if we don’t address the immediate crisis, we will certainly be off-track with the long-term crisis,” he said. Timmermans said his goal was to reassure the public of the EU, by 1 November at the latest, that they would not face a crisis in heating their homes this winter. “I honestly believe that if we can’t give that guarantee then society is on edge, as it is everywhere because of high energy prices, inflation, food prices rising rapidly – because of this uncertainty caused by the war,” he said. “Putin is using all the means he has to create strife in our societies, so we have to brace ourselves for a very difficult period.” Coal would have to be used, he said. “If we were just to say no more coal right now, we wouldn’t be very convincing in some of our member states and we would contribute to tensions within our society getting even higher.” Energy prices have soared across the world as a result of the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine, but Europe has been particularly badly hit. Before Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Germany – the EU’s biggest economy – relied on Russia for the majority of its gas. Overall, Europe depends on Russia for about 40% of its gas. The German government has started to increase electricity production from coal-fired power stations, the dirtiest form of energy, while allowing the phaseout of nuclear power to continue as planned. Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, also insisted that the G7 reverse its stance on banning overseas investment in gas projects to assist in the exploration of new fossil fuel fields in developing countries. The European parliament also voted this week to class some gas and nuclear power projects as “clean” energy for investment purposes, to the dismay of climate campaigners who worry the climate agenda has been lost amid fears over energy prices. Timmermans, who is in charge of the EU’s green deal and leads the bloc in international climate negotiations, insisted that a short-term return to fossil fuels was compatible with limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the goal affirmed at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last November. He also gave qualified support for the expansion of fossil fuel exploration in parts of Africa that civil society leaders have already warned would lock Africa into a high-emissions future without benefiting ordinary people. “In this global situation right now, with the huge shortage of fossil fuel, how can you say to anyone who has fossil fuels: ‘You should not be exploiting that.’” he asked. “How can we not face the immediate challenge of having to find alternatives for Russian gas, and saying to others: ‘You should not be exploiting gas.’ That would be hypocritical. I can’t say that.” But Timmermans dampened expectations for Cop27, the next global climate summit taking place this November in Sharm el-Sheikh. At Cop26, countries failed to produce national plans on cutting emissions in line with the 1.5C limit they affirmed, and so agreed to return to the negotiating table this year with tougher plans called nationally determined contributions (NDCs). These were unlikely to be forthcoming as promised, however, given the energy and food crises and the war in Ukraine, Timmermans said. “I don’t see that many new NDCs on the horizon, frankly,” he said, pointing to Australia, with its new government, as a rare exception. “I don’t have the highest expectations for this by Sharm el-Sheikh because the conference in Bonn that was just finished clearly showed that there’s not much appetite in increasing NDCs, and there is a lot of frustration in the developing world about the money that was promised and is not yet fully on the table.” Timmermans blamed Putin for this failure. “Everything hinges on the energy transition and energy is at the heart of this. “If one of the major energy producers in the world is causing this disruption, as Russia is doing right now, obviously the rest of the world will be edgy in terms of what happens in the energy markets, and obviously that has an implication of can we make further commitments on reducing our emissions given the situation?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/16/a-windfall-tax-on-energy-generators-sure-but-the-devil-is-in-the-complex-detail","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-16T18:29:54Z","webTitle":"A windfall tax on energy generators?

Sure, but the devil is in the complex detail","bodyText":"“It’s like entering a lottery: you know something’s coming your way, but you’ve got no idea exactly what,” says one chief executive of a large UK electricity generator about the looming windfall tax on his sector. It’s a fair comment. Government thinking on the generators – as opposed to the North Sea oil and gas producers, who already have a levy – has been spinning like a wind turbine for six months. Back in May, then-chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was “urgently evaluating” the scale of excess profits being made by generators on the entirely sensible grounds that not all windfall profits have been made by firms producing dirty hydrocarbons. Nuclear power plants, windfarms, solar farms, hydro projects and biomass burners may also be doing very nicely thanks to a UK energy system that ties the price of electricity to the price of gas. But Sunak conceded defeat in the face of complexity. Power is contractually sold forward; hedges complicate matters; the windfall component is hard to isolate. But never mind, Kwasi Kwarteng, then business secretary, was soon looking at a voluntary negotiation with generators to lower the price of energy. Those on old-style (and often lucrative) “renewables obligations” incentives would be switched to newer “contracts-for-difference” where windfall returns don’t arise because revenues over a set price flow to the Treasury. With Kwarteng as chancellor, and Liz Truss as PM, the plan seemed to be set. Soon, though, it morphed into a revenue cap – modelled on the European Union’s version – because negotiations with companies stalled. Then we arrived at the Sunak-Jeremy Hunt combo in Downing Street, and it seems we’re back to something closer to Sunak’s original thought: a conventional windfall tax. That, at least, is the prediction for Thursday’s autumn statement. Alongside an increase in the levy on North Sea firms, the chancellor is expected to introduce a charge of 40%-45% on generators’ “excess returns”. All clear now? Well, it depends on whether “excess” has been defined. Is the EU’s threshold of €180 a megawatt hour for its revenue cap the right level to use in the UK to judge a fair return? Probably not: the EU seemed to be guided by the marginal cost of coal generation, which has been virtually phased out in the UK. And – to pick on one fraught debate – are gas-fired power stations a suitable target for a windfall charge? Attention has mostly focused on nuclear and renewables generators on old-style “renewables obligations” certificates, but the gas-fired crew have also been having a nice crisis, as SSE half-year numbers on Wednesday demonstrated. Should gas-fired stations get softer treatment because their crucial “flexible” capacity has been maintained during rotten years for profits? That was the gist on the argument from SSE’s chief executive, Alistair Phillips-Davies. But one could equally argue it would be perverse to tax renewables (SSE’s prime investment focus) while leaving gas untouched if the government is also trying to accelerate a green transition. Therein lie a few complexities in designing a windfall tax on generators. It ain’t straightforward. The point, though, is that it’s time to make choices – and not boot the detail into another round of consultation, negotiation and lobbying. Delay and uncertainty also impact companies’ investment decisions and the government has been round the houses with the generators for half a year. Hunt must arrive with a plan, as opposed to an intention. Property investors racked with gilts If investors in gilts have been surprised by how much volatility can be generated by rising interest rates and a reckless mini-budget, think of poor investors in property investment trusts. The share prices of the FTSE 100 duo, LandSec and British Land, have been yo-yoing like dotcom startups. The former’s share price was 730p at the end of August, went as low as 480p in September and is now 611p. British Land has swung around in similar fashion. The explanation is those same gilt prices. When yields on government IOUs rise, investors demand a greater return to own a riskier asset such as property. So property values fall. Even so, there’s a glaring mismatch between the declines in property values expected by the industry (10%-15%, generally speaking) and the 40%-ish discounts to published asset values at which the shares of LandSec and British Land currently trade. The stock market’s gloom on commercial property has been justified on many occasions in the past. There’s just a chance, though, that it might be overdoing it this time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/24/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-304-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-24T02:29:38Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 304 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/24/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-304-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/24/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-304-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 304 of the invasion","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has ordered Russia’s defence industry chiefs ensure its army gets all the weapons, equipment and military hardware it needs “in the shortest possible timeframes” to fight in Ukraine. The Russian president also called for their proposals on “addressing the problems that are inevitable” and how to “make sure there are fewer of them”. Putin’s comments in the city of Tula, a centre for Russian arms manufacturing, came just days after he pledged to give his army anything it asked for in a meeting with Russia’s top military officials. The United States has called on Vladimir Putin to acknowledge reality and withdraw troops from Ukraine after he used the word “war” to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Putin on Thursday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since the February invasion, previously calling his campaign a “special military operation”. A state department spokesperson said: “Finally, after 300 days, Putin called the war what it is.” A Russian opposition politician, Nikita Yuferev, has filed a legal challenge over Putin’s use of the word “war”. Russian forces have been demolishing a theatre in occupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine that was the site of a deadly airstrike believed to have killed hundreds of civilians, according to an aide to the city’s exiled Ukrainian mayor. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said the move was an “attempt to hide forever the evidence of the deliberate killing of Ukrainians by Russians”. Video posted on Ukrainian and Russian websites on Friday showed heavy equipment taking down much of the building. An Amnesty International investigation concluded Russian forces committed a war crime by deliberately targeting the building. Iran is seeking to expand the supply of advanced weapons to Russia, the head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency has said, according to local media. The warning from David Barnea comes after the US this month expressed alarm over a “full-scale defence partnership” between Tehran and Moscow. Russian forces shelled the recently liberated Kherson region 61 times on Thursday, killing one person and injuring two, said the head of the eastern Ukrainian region’s military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych. About half the strikes hit Kherson city, striking residential blocks, educational institutions and private houses, he said, while a kindergarten was also affected. Two civilians were killed in shelling of the city on Friday morning, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. Two people were injured after a car bomb exploded in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in south-eastern Ukraine, according to a local pro-Moscow official. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia province, described the incident as a “terrorist attack” carried out by “militants of the Kyiv regime” to Russian state media. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, wrote on Telegram that witnesses reported a car was “blown up”. Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, has described the discovery of a German intelligence official suspected of working for Russia as “alarming”, amid fears the offical had access to sensitive information from western allies. The man, an employee of the BND foreign intelligence agency identified as Carsten L, was arrested on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing state secrets to Russia, German prosecutors said. Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, warned the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high” and compared US-Russia relations to an “ice age” in comments reported by Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency. The Kremlin accused the US of fighting a proxy war against Russia. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted a video saying he is back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office – we are working toward victory,” he said in the video, posted to his Telegram channel on Friday. Zelenskiy’s visit to the White House confirmed that Ukraine and the US are “strategic partners” for the first time in history, the Ukrainian leader’s most senior adviser has said. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainan president’s office, told the Guardian the trip had cemented Zelenskiy’s bond with the US president, Joe Biden, and senior US Republicans. The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had “almost stopped”. Speaking on Russian state television, governor Yevgeny Balitsky said on Friday that Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant – Europe’s largest – and it would never return to Ukrainian control. Ukraine estimates its grain harvest fell by about 40% year-on-year due to the Russian invasion, a representative for the country’s industry said. “We expect a grain harvest of 65-66 million tonnes” by the end of the year, the head of the Ukrainian Grain Association, Sergiy Ivashchenko, said on Friday, after a record harvest of 106m tonnes last year. “The main reason is the war,” which immediately led to fuel shortages and hindered sowing, he said. Ukraine plans to open new embassies in 10 African countries, Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced, with the aim of increasing Kyiv’s presence in Africa and strengthening trade ties. There were also plans to develop a “Ukraine-Africa trade house” with offices in the capitals of “the most promising countries” on the African continent, he added.

Oleh Nikolenko, a spokesperson from Ukraine’s foreign ministry, said the packages were simultaneously sent from one European country, which he could not disclose while the investigation was ongoing. Ukrainian authorities in Kherson have urged people on the east of the Dnipro River to evacuate. Governor Yaroslav Yanushevych said that authorities would help people to evacuate during the daytime of Saturday to Monday, according to the Kyiv Independent. More than 7,000 explosives have been removed from around Kherson, the Ukrainian state emergency service has said. Russian forces are concentrating most of their strength on taking the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk, according to the British Ministry of Defence. The price cap on Russian seabourne oil has been expanded to the G7 and Australia, after it was agreed by EU countries. Poland had held out on a lower amount than the $60 per barrel that was agreed. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would “not accept this ceiling”. Another 510 Russian troops were killed on Friday according to Ukraine, bringing the total killed since the invasion in February to 90,600. A tank and eight drones were also lost by the Russians. Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine’s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine’s general staff. One person was killed and six were injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine on Friday. Zelenskiy aide Kyrylo Tymoshenko said one civilian was killed and four injured in the Donetsk region, one was injured in Kharkiv and another in Kherson. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnipro River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. The Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help Europe is not resilient enough. The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times, Reuters reported. Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative.

The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. Germany is aiming to deliver seven Gepard tanks that had been destined for the scrap pile to Ukraine this spring, adding to 30 of the air-defence tanks that are already being used to fight against the Russian army, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday. Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation PEN. The United States is reportedly working with two Middle Eastern countries to shift advanced Nasams air defence systems to Ukraine in the next three to six months. Kyiv received two of the eight approved deliveries of Nasams in early November. Russia tested a new missile defence system rocket, its defence ministry said. The missile was launched from the Sary Shagan testing range in Kazakhstan. Other than saying the test was successful, the ministry gave few other details. The chief economic adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on BP to exit Russia entirely after the fossil fuel firm was offered a £580m dividend by the oil giant Rosneft. Oleg Ustenko has written to BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, to demand the British company cuts ties with the state-controlled Russian firm nine months after announcing its intention to leave the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/may/30/atoms-and-ashes-by-serhii-plokhy-review-why-another-nuclear-disaster-is-almost-inevitable","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-30T08:00:23Z","webTitle":"Atoms and Ashes by Serhii Plokhy review – why another nuclear disaster is almost inevitable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/30/atoms-and-ashes-by-serhii-plokhy-review-why-another-nuclear-disaster-is-almost-inevitable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/may/30/atoms-and-ashes-by-serhii-plokhy-review-why-another-nuclear-disaster-is-almost-inevitable","fields":{"headline":"Atoms and Ashes by Serhii Plokhy review – why another nuclear disaster is almost inevitable","bodyText":"Once hailed as a source of electricity that would be too cheap to meter, atomic power has come a long way since the 1950s – mostly downhill. Far from being cost-free, nuclear-generated electricity is today more expensive than power produced by coal, gas, wind or solar plants while sites storing spent uranium and irradiated equipment litter the globe, a deadly radioactive legacy that will endure for hundreds of thousands of years. For good measure, most analysts now accept that the spread of atomic energy played a crucial role in driving nuclear weapon proliferation. Then there are the disasters. Some of the world’s worst accidents have had nuclear origins and half a dozen especially egregious examples have been selected by Harvard historian Serhii Plokhy to support his thesis that atomic power is never going to be the energy saviour of our imperilled species. His “six of the worst” includes the explosions that wrecked power stations at Chernobyl in 1986, Three Mile Island in 1979 and Fukushima in 2011, as well as the fire at the Windscale reactor in 1957; the Bikini Atoll hydrogen bomb test that spread radioactive cloud across the Pacific Ocean in 1954; and the 1957 Kyshtym disaster, which irradiated 20,000 square miles of the Urals after a Soviet plutonium production plant exploded. All were caused – in varying degrees – by poor design, technological mistakes, hubris and operator error. Dozens died trying to limit the effects of these disasters and thousands of citizens were exposed to radiation that will have triggered tumours and premature death. In the case of the Kyshtym accident, a huge tract of irradiated land was declared uninhabitable, and remains that way 65 years after the disaster, while the clean-up bill for Fukushima is now estimated at $187bn (£150bn). National leaders reacted in different ways. President Jimmy Carter was quick to visit Three Mile Island to provide reassurance that the site was no longer a danger to America, contrasting with Mikhail Gorbachev, who waited three years before he popped over to see how things were going at Chernobyl. Some operators reacted with panic as reactors caught fire and alarm blared through their control rooms, though a great many were calm, if baffled, as fresh catastrophes continued to unfold, with the prize for cool-headedness going to Windscale operator Arthur Wilson, who realised the plant’s Number 1 reactor was on fire and ready to explode. “I thought, ‘Oh, dear, now we are in a pickle,’” he recalled. Nor are we likely to have experienced our last nuclear disaster, adds Plokhy in this grim but expertly concise account of what happens when atom plants go bad. The world has about 440 reactors in operation and another Fukushima-like blast at one of these is almost inevitable, probably before the middle of the next decade. Yet politicians keep coming back to the nuclear industry, most recently as a solution to global heating and our current energy crisis. Reactors emit very little carbon dioxide and can provide significant amounts of electricity – once they are up and running. In a world seeking climate stability and freedom from Russian oil and gas, they can look attractive. Hence Boris Johnson’s promise that “nuclear is coming home” and should be supplying 25% of UK’s power by 2050. Plokhy will have none of this. “Nuclear power is too costly and it takes too long to build a reactor and it is inherently unsafe not only for technological reasons but also because of the risk of human error,” he says. And given the past failures and disasters that he highlights, it is hard not to agree with him, though we should note that his arguments carry a careful coda. Nuclear power still generates 10% of the world’s electricity and that is a precious supply. Lose it and fossil fuels would have to fill the gap. So we still need the nukes that we have already got – for the moment at least – but please do not add any more to the list, says Plokhy whose Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy won the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction in 2018. As he puts it, the nuclear industry has gone past its spring and summer years and should be allowed to reach a useful but limited autumn before it is quietly forgotten as a dark global experiment that should not be repeated. • Atoms and Ashes: From Bikini Atoll to Fukushima by Serhii Plokhy is published by Allen Lane (£25).

We will be closing this blog and moving to the new page below. Singapore has outlined details of the financial measures it will impose on Russia, after it announced on Monday that it would take the rare step of imposing sanctions. In a statement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: We will impose financial measures targeted at designated Russian banks, entities and activities in Russia, and fund-raising activities benefiting the Russian government. Digital payment token service providers are specifically prohibited from facilitating transactions that could help to circumvent these financial measures. These measures apply to all financial institutions in Singapore, including banks, finance companies, insurers, capital markets intermediaries, securities exchanges and payment service providers. The statement describes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “a gross violation of international law”. It is the first country in Southeast Asia to impose sanctions. Full details of the measures are on the ministry website. The Washington Post’s media reporter says the paper will no longer include staff names on stories produced by reporters in Russia, to protect their safety. This is in response to a new law imposed in Russia that threatens jail terms of up to 15 years for spreading “fake news” about the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine. The law has prompted several global news organisations to suspend reporting in the country, including the BBC, the Canadian Broadcasting Company and Bloomberg News. CNN and CBS News said they would stop broadcasting in Russia. The port city Mariupol has been “blockaded” by Russian forces, according to its mayor, AFP reports. Mayor Vadym Boychenko has perviously warned the city has no water, heat or electricity and that supplies of food are running out. He has asked for military assistance and for a humanitarian corridor to allow the safe evacuation of some of the city’s 400,000 residents. If Russia were to control the city, this would help it to build a land corridor between Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, and Russian-backed regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. In a message posted to the mayor’s Telegram account, he said: For now, we are looking for solutions to humanitarian problems and all possible ways to get Mariupol out of the blockade... Our priority is the establishment of a ceasefire so that we can restore vital infrastructure and set up a humanitarian corridor to bring food and medicine into the city. Here are images from across Ukraine’s towns and cities, taken on Friday. More than 1.2 million people have fled from Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February. The UN Refugee Agency believes a similar number are displaced but remain within the country’s borders. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN has said that Russian forces are now “20 miles and closing from Ukraine’s second largest nuclear facility”, warning that imminent danger continues. “We narrowly avoided a disaster last night,” she said, referring to Russia’s recent attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, about 140 miles (225 km) west of Mariupol. “The international community must be unanimous in demanding Russia’s forces stop their dangerous assaul,” she said. Samsung has become the latest company to suspend shipments to Russia, Bloomberg reports. In a statement, the company said: “Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted and our priority is to ensure the safety of all our employees and their families.” The company is also donating $6 million, including $1 million in consumer electronics products, to humanitarian efforts in the region, according to Bloomberg. Microsoft has also suspended all sales and services to Russia, while Apple has suspended sales of iPhones, and restricted other services. A Sky News crew has been evacuated back to the UK from Ukraine after journalists were shot during an ambush by a suspected Russian “death squad”. The team of five were attacked while out in a car, after unsuccessfully trying to visit the town of Bucha near Kyiv. Chief correspondent with Sky News, Stuart Ramsay, along with camera operator Richie Mockler were shot – Ramsay in the lower back while Mockler took two rounds in his body armour. Hello, Rebecca Ratcliffe here in Bangkok, taking over from my colleague Dani. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will address the US Senate on Saturday during a Zoom call that is scheduled for 9.30am Eastern Time. The call has been requested by Zelenskiy. Here is AFP’s report As the war in Ukraine intensifies, some US lawmakers are urging President Joe Biden to take a tougher stance against Russia, such as by suspending imports of its oil. The White House has ruled this out so far, fearing it might cause rising oil prices to go up even more and hurt US consumers stung by record inflation. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has called for “somebody in Russia” to assassinate President Vladimir Putin. Zelensky himself is strongly urging NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to halt bombing raids but the Biden administration has ruled this out, fearing it might lead to an all-out war between the West and Russia, although some US lawmakers support the creation of such a zone. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has critisized Nato for refusing to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying the decision has given “the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian towns and villages”. “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity,” the Ukrainian president said in an emotional nighttime address. Nato warned on Friday that imposing a no-fly zone could provoke full-fledged war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia. “The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send Nato fighter planes into Ukraine’s airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,” Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato chief, said. “If we did that, we’ll end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering.” Zelenskiy said Nato countries have created a narrative that a no-fly zone would provoke Russia’s aggression against Nato. “This is the self-hypnosis of those who are weak, insecure inside, despite the fact they possess weapons many times stronger than we have,” he said. He also praised Ukrainians for their resistance against Russia’s invasion: “We are warriors of light,” he said. “The history of Europe will remember this forever.” The war in Ukraine is shaking markets, slowing economic growth and sending European stocks sinking. From Reuters: Data showing a vibrant U.S. jobs market strengthened the dollar and spurred commodity prices higher, but the war in Ukraine overshadowed the blowout report as the euro plunged on the worsening outlook for slower European economic growth. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.8% as job growth surged in February, a bright spot for an economy that faces mounting headwinds from rising inflation, tighter monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and geopolitical tensions. The euro tumbled below $1.10 for the first time in almost two years and hit a fresh seven-year low against the safe-haven Swiss franc as Russian forces seized the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and fighting raged elsewhere in Ukraine. European stocks sank to near one-year lows, with the pan-regional STOXX 600 index sliding 3.56% to increase losses for the week to 7% - its worst weekly decline since the depths of a pandemic-fueled sell-off in March 2020. The Metropolitan police’s war crimes team is assisting in the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation of alleged war crimes in Ukraine. The Met is tasked with carrying out “any UK enquiries into war crimes and core international crimes”, it said Friday, and is “appealing for anyone in the UK who may have direct evidence of war crimes”. “Officers are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may themselves have witnessed or been the victim of any war crimes in Ukraine at any time from 21 November 2013 onwards,” the Met said. Investigators are seeking out people who have a direct link to relevant information, rather than the general public submitting social media posts or media reports. “This could be in the form of direct messages, images or videos that friends or relatives here in the UK have been sent by those in Ukraine. Or it could be somebody who was previously in Ukraine and who may have witnessed or even been a victim of a war crime and has since travelled to the UK,” said Richard Smith, the head of the Met’s counter terrorism command. Several leading luxury brands, including Hermes, the Cartier owner Richemont, LVMH, Kering and Chanel, announced they will temporarily close stores and halt business operations in Russia. “Given our increasing concerns about the current situation, the growing uncertainty and the complexity to operate, Chanel decided to temporarily pause its business in Russia,” the French luxury fashion house said in a post on LinkedIn. More from Reuters: Luxury giant LVMH, which owns such brands as Christian Dior, Givenchy, Kenzo, TAG Heuer and Bulgari among others, will close its 124 boutiques in Russia from Sunday but will continue to pay the salaries for its 3,500 employees in the country, a spokesperson told Reuters. French multinational Kering, whose brands include brands as Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Boucheron among others, has two shops and 180 employees, which the company will continue to support. While affluent Russians are keen consumers of luxury goods, analysts say the proportion of luxury sales generated from Russian nationals is small compared to the industry’s main growth engines, China and the United States. Richemont, which also owns Dunhill, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Montblanc, Piaget, and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels among other brands, has around a dozen directly operated stores, mostly in Moscow. It said in a statement it had suspended commercial activities in Russia on March 3 after stopping Ukraine operations on Feb. 24, the day Russia launched its invasion. Senior US military leaders haven’t spoken with their Russian counterparts since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, officials said Friday. From Reuters: Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley had not spoken with their counterparts. Prior to Russia’s invasion, both Austin and Milley had spoken with their counterparts. A 43-year-old father and resident of Kyiv spoke to the Guardian about how life has changed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began a week ago. My son’s a very brave boy. He’s trying not to cry. He’s trying to help. But every time the siren sounds from outside the window, and we have to run downstairs to the shelter again, I can see he’s scared. But he doesn’t panic. That day I was standing with a neighbour outside in our yard. Suddenly we heard gunshots from automatic rifles close by. Later I read the news via Telegram that Russian troops were trying to infiltrate the city. It said they were liquidated. At the moment you hear gunfire, you’re not afraid – you don’t have time to be afraid, you just have to get your son to safety in the car park. The shock comes a little later, when you realise you could have been killed. More of Mike’s first-person account from Jem Bartholomew: CNN will stop broadcasting in Russia. A spokesperson for the news channel said on Friday it would cease broadcasting “while we continue to evaluate the situation and our next steps moving forward,” Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Bloomberg News said it would temporarily suspend the work of its journalists inside Russia in response to a new law passed by Putin the outlet says “criminalises independent reporting in the country”. “We have with great regret decided to temporarily suspend our news gathering inside Russia,” John Micklethwait, the Bloomberg editor-in-chief, said. “The change to the criminal code, which seems designed to turn any independent reporter into a criminal purely by association, makes it impossible to continue any semblance of normal journalism inside the country.” The BBC announced earlier today it would temporarily halt its news operation in Russia due to the new law, as has the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Journalists with Sky News were violently ambushed in Ukraine on Monday as they attempted to return to Kyiv. Harrowing footage published by the outlet on Friday shows an explosion and then a barrage of bullets hitting the team’s vehicle before they flee into a nearby warehouse. Bullets cascaded through the whole of the car, tracers, bullet flashes, windscreen glass, plastic seats, the steering wheel, and dashboard had disintegrated. We didn’t know it at the time, but we were later told by the Ukrainians that we were being ambushed by a saboteur Russian reconnaissance squad. It was professional, the rounds kept smashing into the car - they didn’t miss ... We knew we had to get out to survive, but the incoming fire was intense. One journalist took two rounds to his body armour, and another was wounded. The team has since returned to the UK. Read correspondent Stuart Ramsay’s full account here Canada’s Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) said today that they will be temporarily suspending reporting from Russia, citing a new law passed by Putin today where those intentionally spreading “fake” news could face jail time. Here’s the statement published by CBC on the matter: CBC/Radio-Canada is very concerned about new legislation passed in Russia, which appears to criminalize independent reporting on the current situation in Ukraine and Russia. In light of this situation and out of concern for the risk to our journalists and staff in Russia, we have temporarily suspended our reporting from the ground in Russia while we get clarity on this legislation. We join other media in standing up for a free press and unimpeded access to accurate, independent journalism in Ukraine and Russia. Our journalists have been doing vital work to bring all elements of this story to Canadians and people around the world. We are proud of their professionalism and determination and we will continue to support their work. Italian police have seized a yacht owned by Alexey Mordashov, once the richest man in Russia before being blacklisted by the European Union, said a source familiar with the matter to Reuters. The 215ft yacht, “Lady M,” was sequestered in the northern Italian port of Imperia, confirmed the source. A second yacht owned by billionaire Gennady Timchenko, who also has close ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, is being blocked in Imperia and will be impounded shortly, the source added. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III posted a statement to Twitter summarizing his recent talks with Polish defense minister Mariusz Błaszczak about Russia’s war on Ukraine: I spoke today with Polish Defense Minister [Mariusz Błaszczak] on our collective efforts to strengthen NATO’s deterrence and defense and to support Ukraine. I commend Poland’s extraordinary efforts, along with those of other Allies and partners, to help the Ukrainian people. #WeAreNATO Russia is not cooperating on proposed humanitarian corridors in Kherson, says Ukrainian officials, reports the Washington Post’s David Stern, Adela Suliman, and Adam Taylor: Local officials in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson said Friday that Russia is not living up to its side of the bargain on proposed “humanitarian corridors,” even as supplies of food and other necessities begin to dwindle in the region. Leaders from Ukraine and Russia announced Thursday they had agreed to temporary cease-fires to support “humanitarian corridors” for civilians to be evacuated and so food and medicine could be delivered. But local Ukrainian officials in the Kherson region say that the Russian military is not working with them and is instead pushing a plan to distribute its own aid unilaterally. Regional governor Gennady Laguta wrote on Facebook on Friday that the “occupiers” had not given the go-ahead to send humanitarian aid to the Kherson region through the proposed corridor. Laguta said that Ukrainian authorities had readied 19 trucks, but they were not yet being allowed to go in. The Russians “say that they will provide humanitarian aid themselves,” Laguta wrote. In his own message to Facebook, Kherson Mayor Ihor Kolykhaev said that the agreement was not helping the city. “Despite yesterday’s agreements at the highest level, in practice,” Kolykhaev wrote, “all this is not yet working.” “But, judging by everything, ‘good liberators’ are preparing to bring their ‘rescue’ to Kherson. First they brought the situation to a critical point, and then heroically they will save us,” Kolykhaev wrote, referring to Russia. Read the full article here (paywall). British prime minister Boris Johnson said in an interview today that he saw a “close analogy” between Russian president Vladimir Putin and late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, who was charged with war crimes, reports Agence France-Presse. Here are Johnson’s full comments from an interview he did with El País: [Interview question]: You said in the House of Commons that Putin is a war criminal. Should the West aspire to put this war criminal in front of an International court, like Milosevic or the Nuremberg trial? [Johnson’s answer] What I certainly believe is that there is a close analogy between Putin’s behavior and the last years of Slobodan Milosevic. It’s very interesting that both leaders had been in power for a long time, both increasingly autocratic, both seeking to shore up their domestic position, and found a great nationalist cause. Slobodan Milosevic identified the birthplace of Serbian nationalism, indeed the Serbian nation, in Kosovo Poljie, and he inspired his people with this misbegotten idea that it needed to be rescued and liberated. There’s a very close sort of analogy between that catastrophic mistake, and what the president of Russia has been saying about Kyiv and the origins of Russian religion and culture and civilization and his objectives in Ukraine. When it comes to the International Criminal Court, that’s a matter for them. There would have to be the gathering of evidence. If there is evidence of the use of illegal munitions, cluster bombs, barrel weapons, this clearly will have to be brought to the Netherlands. Read the full interview here. Poland has arrested a Spanish journalist on suspicion of being a Russian spy who was planning to “go to Ukraine in order to continue his activity,” Internal Security Agency (ABW) said on Friday. The suspect, identified as an “agent of Russia’s military intelligence agency (GRU)”, is currently detained in Przemysl - near Poland’s border with Ukraine on Sunday night, ABW said in a statement. The note released by the Police said he was of Russian origin. ABW said the man carried out operations to benefit Russia and travelled in Europe and elsewhere under the cover of being a journalist. His lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, told Reuters he had not yet been able to contact his client. He tweeted earlier that his client had been charged with espionage and was being held in Rzeszow prison. Spain’s foreign ministry said it had been informed by Polish authorities of the charges but could not provide any details. It said it would offer consular assistance. “Before his detention, he was planning to go to Ukraine in order to continue his activity,” said Spain’s foreign ministry. More on Russia’s ongoing online censorship: following a ban on Twitter in Russia, Youtube also appears to be blocked throughout the country. From NEXTA news: Russian state media regulator Roskomnadzor has restricted access to Twitter, confirmed Tass news agency today. Experts are weighing in on the recent ban that is sending the country into almost complete online isolation as Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine continues. From CNN’s Senior Global Affairs analyst Bianna Golodryga: And there goes Twitter in Russia. The country has been disconnected from the world. In one week a nation of 145m- hermetically sealed. With barely any objection from Putin’s Duma. They approved his “special operation” in Ukraine and his massive repression and censorship at home. From ABC foreign correspondant James Longman: I’m still able to access Facebook and Twitter in Russia. It may take time for code to trickle through, I don’t know. But for now full access. Announcing a ban on something is one thing, making sure it happens is another. Earlier today, Russia also blocked Facebook across the country, another example of online censorship that was met with stark criticism from Western countries. “We are deeply concerned about this and concerned about the threat on freedom of speech in the country,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. This just in: Russia has banned Twitter throughout the country, according to Interfax news agency. This story is developing- more details to come. Putin signed a bill into law today that introduces jail terms of up to 15 years for people publishing “fake news” about the Russian army as Russia moves forward with its invasion of Ukraine, reports Agence France-Presse. The bill, which was adopted by lawmakers earlier on Friday, sets out jail terms of varying lengths and fines against people who publish “knowingly false information” about the military, with harsher penalties to hit when dissemination is deemed to have serious consequences. Putin also signed a bill that would allow fines or jail terms of up to three years for calling for sanctions against Russia with Moscow facing harsh economic penalties from Western capitals over the invasion. The past year has seen an unprecedented crackdown on independent and critical voices in Russia that only intensified after the start of the invasion. Russia’s media watchdog said Friday it had restricted access to the BBC and other independent media websites and blocked social media giant Facebook. Two news outlets said they will stop reporting on Ukraine to protect their journalists, while the BBC announced a halt of its operations in Russia. Russian media have been instructed to only publish information provided by official sources, which describe the invasion as a military operation. State-controlled broadcasters have meanwhile reinforced government narratives about nationalism in Ukraine and Moscow’s claim that Ukrainian soldiers are using civilians as human shields. The US is currently weighing options if it decides to cut consumption of Russian energy, said the White House. From Reuters: The Biden administration is looking at options if it were to decide to cut U.S. consumption of Russian energy, White House economic adviser Cecilia Rouse said on Friday, adding that the United States does not import much Russian oil. “What’s really most important is that we maintain (a) steady supply of global energy,” Rouse told reporters at a White House news briefing, adding that the administration was “considering a range of options that we could take right now” if needed. It is 9:20 pm in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand now: Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, was seized by Russian forces on Friday, after an attack that started a fire close to one of its six reactors. No release of radiation was reported, but Ukrainian officials said workers had not been able to check all the safety infrastructure in the wake of the attack. An emergency of the UN security council was summoned following the attack on the Zaporizhzhia NPP. The US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the world narrowly averted a “nuclear catastrophe” and condemned Russia’s actions as “reckless” and “dangerous”. Seven people were killed, including two children, after a Russian air strike hit a rural residential area in the Kyiv region on Friday, Ukrainian police said. Police said the strike hit the village of Markhalivka, around 6 miles from the southwestern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. The Ukrainian city of Mariupol has no water, heat or electricity and is running out of food after coming under attack by Russian forces for the past five days, its mayor said in a televised appeal. He called for a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians from the south-eastern port city. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg warned the days to come are “likely to be worse”, calling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades”. But he stressed Nato was a “defensive alliance” and not seeking a war with Russia. Nato foreign ministers discussed a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine but agreed that Nato planes should not operate over Ukrainian airspace, Stoltenberg said. He also said Nato had evidence Russia was using cluster bombs. Russia’s parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” information about the armed forces. Russia’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper said it will remove material on Russia’s military actions in Ukraine from its website. The BBC is temporarily suspending the work of all its journalists and staff in Russia. BBC director general Tim Davie said the new legislation appeared to “criminalise the process of independent journalism”. Russia’s media watchdog Roskomnadzor said it had decided to block access to the Facebook network in Russia. It added that there had been 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020. More than 1.2m people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February, the UN said, including about half a million children. The UN human rights council overwhelmingly voted to create a top-level investigation into violations committed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with 32 members of the 47-seat council in favour and only Russia and Eritrea voting against. UK foreign secretary Liz Truss posted a statement to Twitter following an announcement today that the UK will be bolstering sanctions against Russia. From foreign secretary Liz Truss: We have shown Putin that his invasion has consequences. In addition to one of the world’s biggest sanctions packages against Russia, we are ratcheting up pressure by introducing emergency legislation to go faster and harder on Putin’s enablers. They will have nowhere to hide. Compared to other countries and the EU, the UK has sanctioned the second-lowest number of entities since the Russian invasion, according to a visual by Bloomberg: The UK is “bolstering” its package of sanctions against the Kremlin with “new powers in our arsenal to go further and faster”, Boris Johnson said. The UK prime minister said the changes will “ramp up the pressure on those criminal elites trying to launder money on UK soil”, ensuring they have “nowhere to hide”, PA news agency reports. The amendments to the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill will “help streamline the current legislation so we can respond even more swiftly and effectively to the current crisis in the way we sanction individuals”, the Foreign Office said. The FCDO said the provisions will allow the UK to align more rapidly with the individual designations imposed by allies such as the US, Canada and the EU. The changes also include shortening the length of time foreign owners of UK property will be given to declare their true identity under a new register of overseas entities, from 18 months to six months. Criminal penalties for non-compliance are set to increase from fines of up to 500 per day to up to 2,500 per day under a further amendment. About 100 people could still be trapped under rubble after a missile attack hit a large apartment block in Borodyanka, a small town 60km north-west of Kyiv, Ukraine’s state emergency service said. A spokesperson for the service told CNN that “about 100 people may be trapped under the rubble” in Borodyanka after the attack on Thursday but “it is impossible to give a more precise figure at the moment.” Rescuers do not have access to these people due to the constant shelling. We are ready to evacuate people as soon as there is an agreement on a ‘green corridor. Thousands of people living in the area near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine are unable to evacuate because of ongoing shelling by Russian forces, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations said. Speaking at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of lying about its takeover of the country’s biggest nuclear power plant. Russia’s defence ministry has blamed the overnight attack at the site of the Zaporizhzhia plant on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a “monstrous provocation”. Its account has directly contradicted Ukraine’s version of events. Ukraine has said Russian forces attacked the plant in the early hours of Friday, setting an adjacent five-storey training facility on fire. G7 foreign ministers issued a joint statement saying Russia would face further “severe sanctions” for its invasion of Ukraine, Daniel Boffey writes. We will continue to impose further severe sanctions in response to Russian aggression, enabled by the Lukashenko regime in Belarus. We urge Russia to stop its attacks especially in the direct vicinity of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants. Speaking in Brussels following a meeting of western foreign ministers, Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, said they had been given an update via videolink by Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba. They are shelling residential housing, schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructures, Borrell told reporters: It looks like they want to destroy Ukraine. Russia’s state regulator Roskomnadzor said it had decided to block access to the Facebook network in Russia. Russian state-owned news agency Ria said the country’s media watchdog had decided to block access to the social media platform. It added that there had been 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020 International students trapped in a Ukrainian town near the Russian border have made desperate appeals for evacuation, as the number thought to be stranded in Sumy has risen to between 1,200 and 1,500, Lisa O’Carroll and Emmanuel Akinwotu report. One student interviewed by Indian TV on Friday begged for immediate help, saying they were running out of food and water. Please take some immediate action or else we will die for sure. Earlier this week, it emerged that 500 foreign students were stuck in the city, including almost 400 Nigerians, three Irish students and pupils from Rwanda, Lebanon and Tanzania. Indian media are reporting that there are between 700 and 1,000 more. Aashik Hussain Sarkar, an Indian medical student, said they witnessed a massive bomb in Friday: Please evacuate us immediately. More than 1,000 Indians are waiting. One student told the Indian network NDTV they had been waiting on the street for buses to take them to the border when a loud explosion occurred and they rushed to the bunker under their student apartment block. Sumy was still under Ukrainian control, according to the students. A student said: Right now there is no electricity. There is shortage of water. When we heard that bombardment sound, we just took our passport and we ran into the bunkers. We were really so scared. This time the noise was really really extreme. We were waiting for a military pass to the border for one-and-a-half hours and at this last moment we heard this noise and we were shifted in here. Now the current situation is the Ukrainian government is now allowing us to travel to the border. The world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe overnight when a fire broke out during a Russian seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the US ambassador to the United Nations said. Speaking at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia’s actions were “reckless” and “dangerous”. By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night. We all waited to exhale as we watched the horrific situation unfold in real time. The attack overnight reflected a “dangerous new escalation” in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, she said, warning that “imminent danger” persisted, citing Russian troops whom she said were 20 miles from Ukraine’s second-largest nuclear facility. Russia’s attack last night put Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at grave risk. It was incredibly reckless and dangerous. And it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe. She demanded assurances from Moscow that such an assault will not happen again. Microsoft has joined Apple in suspending product sales in Russia, Dan Milmo reports. The US tech firm provides the software behind more than a billion devices worldwide, as well as providing cloud computing services and being a major player in gaming through the Xbox. Microsoft said it would “suspend all new sales of Microsoft products and services” in Russia, but declined to elaborate on how the policy would be applied. Like the rest of the world, we are horrified, angered and saddened by the images and news coming from the war in Ukraine and condemn this unjustified, unprovoked and unlawful invasion by Russia, Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a blog post. On Tuesday Apple said it halted sales of its products in Russia, while social media companies including Facebook owner Meta have blocked Russian state-owned media services across Europe. Microsoft also said it has also taken action over harmful cyberattacks against the Ukrainian state. Since the war began, we have acted against Russian positioning, destructive or disruptive measures against more than 20 Ukrainian government, IT and financial sector organizations, Smith’s blog said. A video filmed in the Ukrainian town shows crumpled shops, buildings blackened by fire, and a road strewn with debris. Residents say the barrage of shelling, rocket assaults and airstrikes since the start of the war have damaged or destroyed nearly every building in Volnovakha. The US state department has reportedly urged US embassies in Europe not to share a tweet posted by the US embassy in Kyiv calling the attack on the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant by Russia a war crime, CNN reports. Earlier today the US embassy in Kyiv said attacking a nuclear power plant is a war crime after Russian forces seized Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant on Friday in heavy fighting in southeastern Ukraine, triggering global alarm. CNN has reviewed an “urgent” message from the US state department to all US embassies in Europe telling them not to retweet the US Embassy Kyiv’s tweet. All – do not/not retweet Embassy Kyiv’s tweet on shelling of the facility being a possible war crime. If you have retweeted it – un-retweet it ASAP. The message is an indication that the US government may not be endorsing the war crime allegation made by the embassy, the news channel writes. Seven people were killed, including two children, after a Russian air strike hit a rural residential area in the Kyiv region on Friday, Ukrainian police have said. Police said the strike hit the village of Markhalivka, around 6 miles from the southwestern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov shared a photo of Markhalivka, where he claimed three children had died as a result of a Russian attack. Here’s more on the impact of new Russian legislation that could jail anyone found to be intentionally spreading “fake” news. Russia’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper said it will remove material on Russia’s military actions in Ukraine from its website because of censorship. The newspaper, whose editor Dmitry Muratov was a co-winner of last year’s Nobel peace prize, said it would remove all of its war coverage due to the threat of criminal prosecution its journalists and readers could face. In a statement, Novaya Gazeta would continue to report on the consequences that Russia is facing, including a deepening economic crisis and the persecution of dissidents. Military censorship in Russia has quickly moved into a new phase: from the threat of blocking and closing publications (almost fully implemented) it has moved to the threat of criminal prosecution of both journalists and citizens who spread information about military hostilities that is different from the press releases of the Ministry of Defense. There is no doubt that this threat will be realised. The newspaper said it could not risk the freedom of its staff but also could not ignore its readers’ desire for it to continue working, even under military censorship. It would therefore remove materials “on this topic” from its website and social networks. We continue to report on the consequences that Russia is facing: the developing economic crisis, the rapid decline in living standards, problems with access to foreign medicines and technologies, and the persecution of dissidents, including for anti-war statements. The BBC is temporarily suspending the work of all its journalists and staff in Russia after Russian authorities passed new legislation making the spread of “fake” information an offence punishable with fines or jail terms. On Friday, Russia’s parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military. They also imposed fines for public calls for sanctions against Russia. Russian officials have repeatedly accused the west of spreading false information in an attempt to sow discord among the Russin people. BBC director general Tim Davie said the new legislation appeared to “criminalise the process of independent journalism”. It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspend the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development. Our BBC News service in Russian will continue to operate from outside Russia. He continued: The safety of staff is paramount and we are not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs. I’d like to pay tribute to all of them, for their bravery, determination and professionalism. We remain committed to making accurate, independent information available to audiences around the world, including the millions of Russians who use our news services. Our journalists in Ukraine and around the world will continue to report on the invasion of Ukraine. For more detail and reaction to this you can follow our UK live blog: Footage shared on social media shows the aftermath of a Russian strike in the city of Chernihiv, north of Kyiv. A large block of flats is seen with severe structural damage and windows blown out, and people are heard screaming. Russian forces were driven out of the Ukrainian city of Mykolayiv after attacking it on Friday, regional authorities said. Some fighting continued around the outskirts of the Black Sea port city, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said. It comes after the governor said Russian troops had entered Mykolayiv for the first time this morning. “Let’s not get nervous,” he said in a video statement shared online. The Ukrainian city of Mariupol has no water, heat or electricity and is running out of food after coming under attack by Russian forces for the past five days, its mayor said in a televised appeal. Vadym Boychenko, mayor of Mariupol, said called for a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians from the south-eastern port city. We are simply being destroyed. Earlier this afternoon, a senior US official told reporters that Mariupol remains under Ukrainian control, though Russian troops are continuing to advance and bombard the city, causing utility outages. The US is committed to doing everything needed to stop the war in Ukraine, secretary of state Antony Blinken said. Blinken praised the EU for “historic” steps it has taken against Russia: We are faced together with what is President Putin’s war of choice: unprovoked, unjustified, and a war that is having horrific, horrific consequences for real people. For mothers, fathers. For children. We see the images on TV, and it has to stop. Standing alongside the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, Blinken added: We’re committed to doing everything we can to make it stop. So the coordination between us is vital. The Pentagon has established a new hotline with Russia’s ministry of defence to prevent “miscalculation, military incidents and escalation” in the region as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine advances, a US official told Reuters on Thursday. The US says it has no troops in Ukraine but it and Nato allies in Europe are worried about potential spillover, including accidents, as Russia stages the largest assault on a European state since the second world war. The US and its allies are also channeling millions of dollars’ worth of weaponry to Ukraine’s armed forces, which are using the arms against Russian troops, despite Moscow’s warnings against foreign interference. “The Department of the Defence recently established a de-confliction line with the Russian ministry of defence on March 1 for the purposes of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation,” a senior US defence official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirming a move first reported by NBC. International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons gave one of the most political speeches at an Olympics and Paralympics opening ceremony for decades, as he opened the Beijing 2022 Winter Paralympics saying: “I want – I must – begin with a message of peace as the leader of our organisation. I am horrified at what is taking place in the world right now. The 21st century is a time for dialogue and diplomacy, not war and hate.” Throwing away decades of tradition of only making guarded comments at such events, Parsons continued: “The Olympic Truce for peace during the Olympic and Paralympic Games is a UN resolution. It must be respected and observed, not violated. At the IPC we aspire to a better and more inclusive growth, free from discrimination, free from hate, free from ignorance, and free from conflict.” He finished his speech by almost bellowing the word “Peace”. In 2014 in Sochi, the Ukrainian Winter Paralympics team had staged a symbolic protest, sending only one athlete to the opening ceremony to represent them as Russian troops invaded the Crimean peninsula. Eight years later, with their country again under attack from Russia, the scene was very different. Maksym Yarovyi carried in his nation’s flag ahead of a full delegation, whose arrival in China had been fraught, while the Russian delegation announced that they would be leaving China rather than filing an immediate legal appeal over their expulsion. Microsoft said on Friday it was suspending new sales of its products and services in Russia, becoming the latest major Western company to distance itself from Moscow after the country’s invasion A string of Western companies, including Nike, Apple, H&amp;M and Ikea had already severed relations with Russia as Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine enters its 8th day. In a statement published on Thursday, Ikea said their decisions to suspend operations will “have a direct impact on 15,000 IKEA co-workers” in Russia. In addition to suspending new sales, Microsoft said it was also stopping many aspects of its business in Russia in compliance with US sanctions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Western sanctions that followed in response have led to dire predictions about the Russian economy. The US bank JPMorgan on Thursday forecasted that the country will face a 35% contraction in the second quarter, as the Russian rouble slumped to new record lows against the dollar. The US Embassy in Ukraine said that attacking a nuclear power plant is a war crime after Russia seized a Ukrainian nuclear facility, the biggest in Europe. “It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant. Putin’s shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further,” US Embassy Kyiv said in its post. Russian forces seized Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant on Friday in heavy fighting in southeastern Ukraine, triggering global alarm, but a huge blaze in a training building has been extinguished and officials said the facility was now safe. Russia’s defence ministry spuriously blamed a fire at the plant on a “monstrous attack” by Ukrainian saboteurs and said its forces were in control, Reuters reported. The European Union wants Ukraine to become a member state “as soon as possible”, commissioner Maros Sefcovic told journalists on Friday after a ministers’ meeting. “It’s time for signalling that the Ukrainian people is one of the European peoples and we want them in as soon as possible”, he said, but added that at the moment the bloc needed to focus on short-term measures linked to the war. “I think what (...) is the most important now is to help Ukraine in the fight”, he added. The UN human rights office said it had confirmed 331 civilians have been killed and 675 injured in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began on 24 February, adding that the real toll was likely much higher. The toll, up until midnight on Thursday, rose from 249 in its previous report from a day earlier, Reuters reported. Among the 331 killed were 19 children, the UN said. Most of the victims were killed by explosive weapons such as shelling from heavy artillery, multi-launch rocket systems and missile and air strikes, according to the rights office, which has monitors in Ukraine. The United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency meeting at 11:30am ET (4:30pm GMT) in New York, diplomatic sources said. The emergency meeting has been called in response to the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by Russian troops. The session was requested by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, diplomats told AFP, with the United States, France, Norway, Ireland and Albania joining the call for an urgent meeting. It will include speeches from an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) official and a UN official. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appealed to Russians to stage protests over Russian forces’ seizure of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. A building at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was set ablaze during intense fighting, triggering fears of a potential nuclear disaster. More than 1.2m people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February, according to figures by the United Nations. Around half of a million of those who have fled are youngsters, the UN children’s agency UNICEF estimates. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has projected that more than four million Ukrainian refugees may eventually need protection and assistance. UNCHR communications chief Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams described the rate of the exodus as “phenomenal”. We know that there are many more on the move. Also there are possibly equal numbers inside the country that are internally displaced. Russia is using cluster bombs in Ukraine, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said. We have seen the use of cluster bombs and we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law. Nato foreign ministers discussed a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine but agreed that Nato planes should not operate over Ukrainian airspace, Stoltenberg said. Establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine could result in the war spreading to more European countries, the Nato secretary general. Speaking to reporters in Brussels after a meeting with Nato foreign ministers, he said: We understand the desperation but we also believe that if we did that (establishing a no-fly zone) we would end up with something that could lead to a fully-fledged war in Europe, involving much more countries. Allies agreed not to have Nato planes operating in Ukrainian airspace or Nato troops on Ukraine’s territory, he said. At the same time, we have a responsibility as Nato allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering. Asked about the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the Nato secretary general said: The reckless actions around the nuclear power plant last night just highlights the dangers of this war. War is dangerous and to have military operations conflict fighting going around the nuclear power plant adds to the danger. Stoltenberg stressed that Nato is not seeking a war with Russia. Speaking in Brussels, he said Nato is a “defensive” alliance. “Our core task is to keep our 30 nations safe,” he said. We are not part of this conflict and we have a responsibility to ensure it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine. That would be even more devastating and more dangerous, with even more human suffering. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has warned that the days to come are “likely to be worse” with Russian forces expected to bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across Ukraine. Speaking after an extraordinary meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Stoltenberg described Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades”. With cities under siege, schools, hospitals, and residential buildings shelled. Reckless actions around a nuclear power plant last night and many civilians killed or wounded. The days to come are likely to be worse, with more death, more sufferings, and more destruction. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has strongly condemned the shelling of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant and called for the international community to force Russia to withdraw its forces from the plant. In a statement posted on Facebook, the ministry said the Zaporizhzhya NPP and Chernobyl NPP are currently under the control of Russian armed forces. As a result of the shelling on the territory of the (Zaporizhzhya) nuclear power plant, a fire broke out, killing and injuring several people. The fire has now been extinguished. It warned that if the cooling of the nuclear fuel within the Zaporizhzhya plant is disturbed, it could cause radioactive damage and have “irreparable consequences for Europe’s environment”. Thousands of people – including civilians who are currently unable to evacuate the area near the plant due to ongoing shelling and fighting - would be hurt by this. The ministry added that it was disappointed by the reaction of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and demanded “clear and decisive action” from the UN atomic agency. No release of radioactive material has been detected at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after a military projectile hit a nearby building on the site, UN atomic chief Rafael Grossi has said. Two members of security staff were injured when the projectile struck after the Ukrainian authorities reported an overnight battle with Russian troops near Europe’s biggest power plant. In an update, Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, said the nuclear power plant continued to be operated by its regular staff. The safety systems of the plant’s six reactors had not been affected and there has been no release of radioactive material. Radiation monitoring systems at the site are fully functional. The situation “remains very challenging”, Grossi added, and it has not yet been possible to access the whole site to determine if all systems are fully functional. I’m extremely concerned about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and what happened there during the night. Firing shells in the area of a nuclear power plant violates the fundamental principle that the physical integrity of nuclear facilities must be maintained and kept safe at all time. The UN human rights council has voted overwhelmingly for a resolution condemning alleged rights violations by Russia in Ukraine and setting up a commission of inquiry to investigate them. Only Eritrea voted with Russia against the resolution brought by Ukraine, while 13 abstained. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Yevheniia Filipenko, told the council there was “irrefutable evidence of gross and systematic human rights violations as well as war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia”. It is our common duty to ensure accountability by mandating the documentation and verification of Russia’s crimes and identification of those responsible. Vladimir Putin has warned Russia’s neighbours “not to escalate the situation” by imposing more restrictions on his country. Speaking at a government meeting broadcast today, the Russian president said: There are no bad intentions towards our neighbours. I would also advise them not to escalate the situation, not to introduce any restrictions. We fulfil all our obligations and will continue to fulfil them. Russia did not see “any need” to “aggravate or worsen” relations with other countries, he continued. All our actions, if they arise, they always arise exclusively in response to some unfriendly actions, actions against the Russian Federation. Ukraine’s culture ministry has called for closing the skies over Ukraine because Russian forces are “destroying Ukrainian cultural sites”. Oleksandr Tkachenko, Ukraine’s minister of culture and information policy, said most of Putin’s “war crimes” in his country had been “committed from the air”, according to a statement by the ministry. Russia’s missiles and planes are deliberately destroying historic centres of big cities. Putin wants to destroy Europe’s heritage and culture, wipe it from the face of the earth. The statement warned: A mad dictator threatens to destroy St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, a Unesco church built in the 11th century. Hundreds of innocent victims, the total destruction of churches, cathedrals and museums – is the price of the still opened sky over Ukraine. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you as we unpack all the latest developments on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Otaci is a Moldovan border town, on the opposite side of the Dniester River lies the Ukrainian city of Mohyliv-Podilskyi. As refugees spill over the bridge that links the two, local people are rallying together to provide them with warm food, shelter, internet and free onward travel in cars and taxis. Since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine started on 24 February, more than 1 million people have fled across the closest borders. The conflict could result in the “largest refugee crisis this century”, the UN refugee agency has warned, with up to 4 million people fleeing the country in the coming weeks and months. So far, more than 98,000 refugees have entered Moldova, Europe’s poorest country. The time in Ukraine is 1.05pm. Here is a roundup of the main stories from the day so far: A fire broke out in a training building outside a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday after shelling by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. After burning for at least four hours amid reports Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze, Ukrainian emergency services confirmed the blaze was extinguished at 6.20am local time. The power plant has reportedly been seized by Russian military forces, according to regional authorities. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier said it had put its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at Zaporizhzhia. However, US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm provided reassurance surrounding the Zaporizhzhia power plant reactors, saying there was no elevated radiation readings near the facility and the plant’s reactors are “protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made a fresh appeal to Europe for help following the attack on the nuclear plant. He said: We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism.” Nato’s secretary general Jens Stontenberg has said the attacks by Russia on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest in Europe – highlight the “recklessness” of Vladimir Putin’s war. Forty-seven people were killed in Russian airstrikes on a residential district of the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv on Thursday, regional authorities said. Russia’s communications watchdog has restricted access to several foreign news organisations’ websites including the BBC and Deutsche Welle for spreading what it described as ‘false information’, amid friction about reporting on Ukraine. Russian forces continue to control both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on the capital. Vladimir Putin is “at risk” of ending up in prison for war crimes carried out by his Russian forces in Ukraine, the British justice secretary said on Friday. The Russian parliament has passed a law that makes it a criminal offence to spread “fake” information about its armed forces. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. I’ll be back at 2pm but my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly. The UK Home Office has rejected suggestions that immigration minister Kevin Foster refused to appear before a parliamentary committee to discuss the growing refugee crisis. The home affairs committee has urged him to rethink “given the urgency of the situation”. In a statement, it said: Parliamentary under-secretary of state for immigration and future borders, Kevin Foster MP, has declined an invitation from the home affairs committee to give evidence on the UK’s response to the Ukraine refugee crisis. The committee had issued the invitation to understand what the UK was doing to provide support and refuge to people leaving Ukraine following the invasion by Russia. It is estimated that 1 million people have been displaced by the conflict. Given the urgency of the situation, the committee has asked the minister to reconsider. A Home Office spokesperson said: Home Office ministers are busy responding to the situation in Ukraine at this critical time, including helping reunite thousands of families in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme. Minister Foster has not refused to attend but asked for a later date given this urgent work. Following the news that the BBC has been blocked in Russia, the outlet has been quick to remind people it can be accessed via the ‘dark web’. The BBC linked to an article from 2019 on Twitter that helps users access its content in restricted countries. However, if it is already blocked for the user, the Twitter page also provides some direct links for “dark web” access to its news website. Russia’s communications watchdog has restricted access to several foreign news organisations’ websites including the BBC and Deutsche Welle for spreading what it described as ‘false information’, amid friction about reporting on Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly complained that western media organisations offer a partial – and often anti-Russian – view of the world while failing to hold their own leaders to account for devastating foreign wars such as Iraq and corruption, Reuters reported. The watchdog said on Friday it had blocked the BBC, Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Deutsche Welle and other media outlets, Interfax news agency reported. The BBC said it would not be deterred. “Access to accurate, independent information is a fundamental human right which should not be denied to the people of Russia, millions of whom rely on BBC News every week,” it said. “We will continue our efforts to make BBC News available in Russia, and across the rest of the world.” Some users in Russia could not access the BBC’s website on Friday. Following the fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant the director general of the International Atomic Energy Authority, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said on Friday that he has offered to travel to the Chernobyl site to facilitate a negotiation between Ukraine and Russia. The aim would be to agree a framework to guarantee safety of nuclear plants during the conflict, including how to ensure the physical integrity of sites, maintaining power, safety monitoring systems and that staff at sites are able to fulfil duties. Both sides are considering the proposal. “The situation continues to be extremely tense and challenging,” said Grossi. He added: The physical integrity of the plant has been compromised with what happened last night. we are fortunate that there was no release of radiation and the integrity of the reactors themselves were not compromised. I have indicated to both the Russian Federation and Ukraine my availability and disposition to travel to Chernobyl as soon as possible. Two experts have offered some reassurance that the military activity at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is unlikely to cause a major nuclear incident. Dr Mark Wenman, reader in nuclear materials at Imperial College London, said: The Zaporizhzia nuclear plant has six VVER-1000 pressurised water reactor units producing 20% of Ukraine’s electricity. The plant is a relatively modern reactor design and as such the essential reactor components are housed inside a heavily steel reinforced concrete containment building that can withstand extreme external events, both natural and man-made, such as an aircraft crash or explosions. The reactor core is itself further housed in a sealed steel pressure vessel with 20cm thick walls. The design is a lot different to the Chernobyl reactor, which did not have a containment building, and hence there is no real risk, in my opinion, at the plant now the reactors have been safely shut down. Prof Tom Scott, at the University of Bristol, UK said: Shelling nuclear power plants is against the Geneva conventions and this is obviously very worrying. The good news is that radiation levels around the plant are reportedly normal and five of the six reactors are now turned off, with one still operating. The reactors are all pressurised water reactors and hence don’t have graphite cores which could set on fire as per Chernobyl. Their inherent safety design should mean they are naturally quite resilient to any external perturbations and hence I am not overly concerned that inadvertent damage could cause a major nuclear incident. However, it would be more concerning if the reactors were being deliberately targeted to induce a nuclear incident. Ahead of a busy day of diplomacy in Brussels, Nato’s secretary general Jens Stontenberg has said the attacks by Russia on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest in Europe – highlight the “recklessness” of Vladimir Putin’s war. He said: We condemn the attacks on civilians and overnight we have also seen the reports about the attacks against a nuclear power plant. This just shows the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it. And the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops and engaging in good faith in diplomatic efforts. British foreign secretary Liz Truss is in Brussels for a meeting of Nato ministers and later she will join EU foreign ministers who are also hosting Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, US secretary of state Anthony Blinken, Canada’s foreign minister Mélanie Joly and Stoltenberg. Russia’s defence ministry has sought to blame an attack at the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Ukrainian saboteurs. Ukraine said Russian forces attacked the plant in the early hours of Friday, setting an adjacent five-storey training facility on fire, in an incident that provoked international condemnation of Moscow, a week into its invasion of Ukraine. A Russian defence ministry spokesman said the nuclear plant was operating normally and the area had been under Russian control since 28 February, Reuters reported. “However, last night on the territory adjacent to the power plant, an attempt was made by the Kyiv nationalist regime to carry out a monstrous provocation,” spokesman Igor Konashenkov was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed directly to Russians to stage protests over the seizure of nuclear power infrastructure by Russian troops in Ukraine. “Russian people, I want to appeal to you: how is this possible? After all we fought together in 1986 against the Chernobyl catastrophe,” he said in a televised address. In the UK, the mayor of Salford has written to Michael Gove to ask for help to cut ties with the Russian energy firm Gazprom, warning that “state-owned and/or backed Russian organisations and services are still woven inextricably into the delivery of Local Government services within the United Kingdom”. Paul Dennett wants his local authority not to have to renew its non-domestic natural gas contract with Gazprom, agreed in June 2020 when the Russian firm far outbid domestic providers. He says that councils across the country also use Gazprom because it is so much cheaper than other companies and so automatically wins procurement competitions. Gazprom also provides energy to a number of NHS trusts. On Thursday, the health secretary Sajid Javid began talks with NHS England (NHSE) over ending the contracts, which are reported by Politico to have been worth £16m in 2021. “Our contract will be up for renewal in June, and I do not wish for public money to be spent towards the income of the Russian state during the present military crisis in Ukraine. However, at present under the current round of sanctions and/or rules, such considerations would seemingly not be considered legally relevant in assessing Gazprom’s suitability for winning the next tendering exercise (or not),” Dennett writes in a letter to Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up. Dennett says Salford is fully supportive of the government’s stated ambitions to “inflict devastating consequences on President Vladimir Putin and Russia” following Russia’s unprovoked assault on the sovereign nation of Ukraine, using sanctions and other financial measures. “However, state-owned and/or backed Russian organisations and services are still woven inextricably into the delivery of local government services within the United Kingdom, and at present their involvement in bidding for tenders and contracts is enshrined in UK public procurement regulations for the procurement and tendering of services,” writes Dennett. He wants Gove to change the law to make it easier for local authorities to break ties with Gazprom and stop Gazprom pitching for replacement contracts, even if it means having to pay more for municipal energy. Forty-seven people were killed in Russian airstrikes on a residential district of the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv on Thursday, regional authorities said. It updates an earlier announced death toll of 33 killed, the Reuters news agency reported. Rescue work had to be suspended on Thursday due to heavy shelling, according to the local emergency services. Vladimir Putin is “at risk” of ending up in prison for war crimes carried out by his Russian forces in Ukraine, the British justice secretary said on Friday. Dominic Raab, who is also deputy prime minister, was asked on Times Radio whether he saw the conflict ending with the Russian president “imprisoned for war crimes”. He said: I think it is a very real risk that he must now contemplate. Beyond his personal situation, every commander operating in Ukraine, or indeed Moscow, when they are faced with illegal orders, whether it is to target civilians or otherwise, attack illegal or unlawful sites, they now know the ICC (international criminal court) is investigating and the chief prosecutor Karim Khan is, I believe, travelling to Ukraine. They must now know that they face the very real risk of ending up in the dock of a court and, ultimately, in a prison if they follow through on those illegal, unlawful orders. Canada wants Nato to discuss all scenarios to isolate Russia, the country’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, said when asked whether the alliance should consider a no-fly zone over Ukraine. On her arrival at an extraordinary meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Joly said Nato’s red line was to avoid triggering an international conflict, when asked about the no-fly zone, Reuters reported. But she added: “We want to make sure that scenarios are being discussed”. Meanwhile, Romania’s foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, said Nato must adapt military posture at its eastern flank to new reality after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We have to adapt the posture to the reality, which shows that the Russians troops are in Ukraine and in Belarus, so we need to rethink everything,” he told reporters as he arrived for a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. Romania will increase its defence spending to 2.5% from 2% of GDP starting with the next fiscal year, he added. The Russian parliament has passed a law which makes it a criminal offence to spread “fake” information about its armed forces. The law, passed by the state Duma in the third and final reading, introduces fines and jail sentences for those who intentionally spread false information about the armed forces that has a serious impact, according to a statement by the lower house. Those found to have broken the new law by spreading so-called “false information” about the actions of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine face up to three years in prison. If it is published as part of an “organised group” or uses “false evidence”, the maximum sentence increases to 10 years in prison. If it leads to “serious consequences”, the perpetrators will face up to 15 years in prison. It is thought this new law will have a huge effect of the ability of people to share information about what is happening in Ukraine, as the Kremlin continues to play down its actions to the Russian population. Latvia’s foreign minister has said Nato should “consider all options” when asked about entering direct conflict with Russia. Edgars Rinkēvičs told the BBC’s Today programme that governments “should not exclude” any recourse to stop the invasion. Earlier, the programme heard from former Ukrainian prime minister Oleksiy Honcharuk, who said other European countries “don’t understand” the lengths Putin will go to, PA Media reported. He said leaders from other countries should offer direct military support and “at least to close our skies to protect us from the threat”. Asked about the comments, Mr Rinkevics said: I think we should consider all options but we should also understand, let’s say, some Nato policies can be implemented only if those countries that have necessary assets agree on that. He added that any decision would have to be voted for unanimously. Asked whether Nato may instead be forced to broker an “uncomfortable” settlement with Russia, the minister replied: Well, I think we must do everything that we can. That’s why I’m saying that we should not exclude any options. I’m Tom Ambrose and will be bringing you all the latest news over the next couple of hours. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has reportedly been seized by Russian military forces, according to regional authorities. An update written at 7.30am on the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine’s Facebook page reads: The Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is captured by the military forces of the Russian Federation.” However, the inspectorate says employees are continuing to work on the premises, while operational personnel control the safe condition of the power units. According to the inspectorate units two and three have been disconnected from the network and and nuclear installations are being cooled down “Changes in the radiation state for the current time have not been recorded,” the update adds. However, the potential loss of cooling nuclear fuel could lead to “significant radioactive emissions into the environment” and such an event “may outgrow all previous NPP accidents, including the Chernobyl NPP and Fukusima-Daichi NPP” the authority says, adding that any damage to a reservoir of processed nuclear fuel as a result of the shelling could also lead to radioactive discharge. Here is where we stand so far: A fire broke out in a training building outside a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday after shelling by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. After burning for at least four hours amid reports Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze, Ukrainian emergency services confirmed the fire was extinguished at 6.20am local time. Fighting at the plant has also reportedly stopped, according to the mayor of Enerhodar, a town located south-east of the plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier said it had put its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at Zaporizhzhia. However, US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm provided reassurance surrounding the Zaporizhzhia power plant reactors, saying there was no elevated radiation readings near the facility and the plant’s reactors are “protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made another appeal to Europe for help following the attack on the nuclear plant. He said: We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism.” British prime minister Boris Johnson called Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe. Share prices fell in Asia in the wake of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant fire while the Moscow stock exchange remained closed for the fifth day in a row on Friday. Russian forces continue to control both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv. In a televised speech, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence. Vladimir Putin earlier told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, France’s presidential Élysée Palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.” The UK Ministry of Defence has just released its latest intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine. The ministry noted that Mariupol remains under Ukrainian control but has “likely been encircled by Russian forces” while the city’s civilian infrastructure has been subjected to intense Russian strikes. It also confirmed receiving reports from Ukrainian authorities of a building at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant catching fire after shelling by Russian forces. Meanwhile, the Moscow stock exchange remained closed for the fifth day in a row on Friday as Russian authorities rolled out additional measures to limit the economic impact from imposed sanctions, the Moscow Times reports. Share prices fell in Asia today in the wake of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant fire. Tokyo and Hong Kong faced the steepest falls, with Japan’s benchmark Nikkei index 2.5% lower and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong down by 2.6%. Oil prices rose in Asia morning trade, with Brent crude above $112 a barrel. Meanwhile, bulls have surged into the US crude oil options market in recent days as futures touch highs not seen in a decade, betting that crude’s rally will persist, according to analysts and exchange data cited by Reuters. The global oil market was already tight even before Russia invaded Ukraine last week, which has since sent benchmark Brent and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures soaring over 15% to about 10- and 14-year highs, respectively. US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc will not pre-emptively ban all Russians from using the platform, chief executive officer Brian Armstrong said in a tweet on Friday. “We don’t think there’s a high risk of Russian oligarchs using crypto to avoid sanctions,” Armstrong said, adding that “some ordinary Russians are using crypto as a lifeline now that their currency has collapsed”. Meanwhile, home rental company Airbnb Inc is suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus, according to chief executive officer Brian Chesky. Essential equipment at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been unaffected from an earlier fire, with no change in radiation levels, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said, citing Ukraine’s regulatory authorities. “The Ukraine regulatory authority said a fire at the site had not affected ‘essential’ equipment and plant personnel were taking mitigatory actions,” it said. “There was no reported change in radiation levels at the plant.” US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm earlier provided more reassurance surrounding the reactors at the power station, confirming she had spoken with Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko. In an update posted to Twitter, Granholm said: We have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility. The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.” According to a statement, the IAEE said Ukraine had informed the agency before the fire broke out that a large number of Russian tanks and infantry “broke through the block-post” to the town of Enerhodar, a few kilometres from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP). British prime minister Boris Johnson has spoken with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy after news broke about a fire at the nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhia, calling Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe. A Downing Street spokeswoman called the situation “gravely concerning”. PA Media reports the spokeswoman said: Both leaders agreed that Russia must immediately cease its attack on the power station and allow unfettered access for emergency services to the plant. The prime minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe. He said the UK would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further. The prime minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN security council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners. Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial.” A charter aircraft carrying Russian foreign nationals was held at the Yellowknife airport in Canada’s Northwest Territories, transport minister Omar Alghabra said in a tweet on Thursday. “We will continue to hold Russia accountable for its invasion of Ukraine,” Alghabra added. It remains unclear whether the passengers were transported to their onwards destination. According to the New York Times, two Russian nationals flying in a private jet that had taken off from Geneva landed in northern Canada this week and were prevented from travelling farther, citing Canadian officials. Canada announced on Sunday that it would ban Russian aircraft from entering Canadian airspace in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The United States and the European Union have similar policies in place. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy early this morning made appeal to Europe for help following the attack on Ukraine’s nuclear plant. Europe must wake up now. The largest nuclear station in Europe is on fire. Right now Russian tanks are shelling nuclear units. Those are the tanks that have thermal vision, so they know where they are shelling. They prepared for it. I address all Ukrainians and all Europeans to all people who know the word Chernobyl who know how much suffering and victims were caused by the explosion at the nuclear station. It was a global disaster. Hundreds of thousands of people fought against its consequences. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated. Russia wants to repeat it but six times harder. Europeans, please, wake up. Tell your politicians, Russian troops are shelling [the] Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the city of Enerhodar. There are 6 energy unit. Six. One unit exploded in Chernobyl. We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism. Russian propagandists threatened to cover the world with nuclear ashes. Now it’s not a threat. It’s a reality. We don’t know how the fire at the station will end, when an explosion will happen, god willing, it won’t happen. Our guys always kept the station safe, so there were no provocations, so that nobody could seize the station, so that nobody could plant mines at the station then blackmail the whole world with a nuclear disaster. We must stop Russian troops. Tell your politicians: Ukraine is 15 nuclear units. If there will be an explosion, it will the end to all of us, the end of Europe, the evacuation of Europe. Only immediate action of Europe can stop Russian troops and prevent the death of Europe from the disaster at a nuclear station.” Guardian reporters Calla Wahlquist and Donna Lu have compiled an explainer on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant with all the details you need to know. You can read their full report below. Guardian reporter, Luke Harding, is currently in Lviv, western Ukraine where he says demoralised Russian soldiers tell of their anger at being “duped” into war. Eight days after Vladimir Putin’s invasion it is clear that a significant number of his servicemen are demoralised and reluctant to fight. Some have given themselves up. Others have abandoned their vehicles and have set off back towards the Russian border on foot, lugging their weapons and kitbags, videos suggest. These episodes do not mean that the Kremlin will fail in its attempts to conquer Ukraine, as its tactics shift to brutal shelling of civilians. But low morale among invading troops might be one reason why Russia’s blitzkrieg plan to overwhelm Ukraine appears not to have progressed at the speed Putin would have wanted. The assumption in Moscow was that the operation would be swift and successful. Soldiers were given food and fuel supplies for only two or three days, the videos suggest. The Kremlin also appears to have had a totally fantastical idea of the reception they would get. Several prisoners of war said they had been assured Ukrainians would welcome them as liberators. Russian forces were expecting flowers and cheers, not bullets and bombs, they said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier accused Russia of nuclear terrorism after a fire burned for several hours at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant early Friday morning. The shelling of the nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, prompted widespread concern about the safety of Ukraine’s atomic infrastructure. “We are warning everybody – not a single state apart from Russia has ever shelled nuclear reactors,” Zelenskiy said. “It is the first time in our history, in the history of humankind, that the terrorist state turned to nuclear terrorism.” Watch the video of Zelenskiy’s remarks below. Ukrainian emergency services confirmed just a short while ago that a fire which had broken out in the training building of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant was extinguished after a blaze burned for at least four hours throughout early Friday morning. Ukrainian authorities said the fire was ignited by shelling from Russian forces, claiming Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze. At 6.20am local time, Ukraine’s State Emergency Services issued an update published to their social media channels: At 06:20 the fire in the training building of Zaporizhzhya NPP in Energodar was extinguished.” According to the agency, no casualties have so far been reported. Fighting at the plant also reportedly stopped, according to the mayor of Enerhodar, a town located south-east of the plant. It is 7.20am in Ukraine as Russia’s war enters its ninth day. Here is where the crisis currently stands: A fire broke out in a training building outside a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday, after shelling by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. After burning for at least four hours amid reports Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze, Ukrainian emergency services confirmed the blaze was extinguished at 6.20am local time. Fighting at the plant has also reportedly stopped, according to the mayor of Enerhodar, a town located south-east of the plant.

Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv. In a televised speech, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence. Vladimir Putin earlier told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, France’s presidential Élysée Palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.” For any tips and feedback please contact me through Twitter or at samantha.lock@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-221-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-02T00:46:33Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 221 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-221-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-221-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 221 of the invasion","bodyText":"Russia suffered a humiliating military defeat on Saturday when Ukrainian troops liberated the key eastern city of Lyman, with videos showing them raising a national flag and performing a victory dance. Russia’s ministry of defence admitted its soldiers had retreated. They had been “withdrawn to more advantageous lines”, the ministry said, after their encirclement by Ukrainian forces. The defeat is an embarrassment for Vladimir Putin, who declared on Friday that the city – in the Donetsk region – was Russia’s “for ever”. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, made a surprise visit to Ukraine – her first since Russia’s invasion in February – as Kyiv urged Berlin to send it battle tanks. Lambrecht visited the southern port city of Odesa on Saturday and met her Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, the German defence ministry said. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is no longer leaking under the Baltic Sea because an equilibrium has been reached between the gas and water pressure, pipeline spokesman Ulrich Lissek told AFP. The British prime minster, Liz Truss, has said the series of explosions that severely damaged Russia’s gas pipelines were an act of sabotage. Belarus is preparing to receive Russian soldiers and equipment, the Kyiv Independent reports. There are about 1,000 Russian soldiers in the country. Ukraine’s ambassador to Canada said her country held Russia to account for violating Ukraine’s sovereign airspace by bombing airports, which goes against the 1944 agreement setting out core principles for global aviation. Yuliya Kovaliv told Reuters it was important that all members of the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) addressed “such a drastic breach of the Chicago convention”. Russia failed to win enough votes for re-election to the ICAO’s governing council. The French representative told the assembly after Saturday’s ballot: “When we have votes in our countries, if we don’t like the result, we don’t ask for another vote.” Russia had a place on the UN aviation agency’s 36-member council as one of the “states of chief importance in air transport”. The head of Russia’s region of Chechnya said Moscow should consider using a low-yield nuclear weapon in Ukraine after its battlefield defeat in Lyman. Ramzan Kadyrov said in a message on Telegram addressing Russia’s loss of its stronghold: “In my personal opinion, more drastic measures should be taken, right up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons.” A superyacht built for an oligarch under sanctions is being discreetly offered for sale for £26m ($29m), with buyers advised that any viewings will be in the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. Brokers are being warned that the sale of MySky, built for Igor Kesaev – sanctioned over the supply of weapons to the Russian army – should not be advertised online. Russia has accused the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, of violating the game’s principles by suggesting that Russian athletes might be allowed to return to competition provided they did not support the invasion of Ukraine. Bach told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera: “This war has not been started by the Russian athletes.” Russian authorities informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that the head of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was “temporarily detained” for questioning. Ihor Murashov was detained on his way from the Russian-occupied plant – Europe’s largest – to the town of Enerhodar at about 4pm on Friday. Russia is trying to transfer the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Russian energy firm Rosatom, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, Petro Kotin, has told the BBC. Kharkiv oblast’s governor said Ukrainian authorities found the bodies of at least 20 people in a civilian convoy near the city of Kupiansk. Oleh Syniehubov believed they were killed while they attempted to flee Russian soldiers, according to the Kyiv Independent. Turkey, which has been at the centre of mediation between the west and Russia, rejected Russia’s annexations in Ukraine, calling the Kremlin’s move on four regions a “grave violation” of international law."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jan/03/fury-eu-moves-ahead-plans-label-gas-nuclear-green","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-03T12:18:54Z","webTitle":"Fury as EU moves ahead with plans to label gas and nuclear as ‘green’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/fury-eu-moves-ahead-plans-label-gas-nuclear-green","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/03/fury-eu-moves-ahead-plans-label-gas-nuclear-green","fields":{"headline":"Fury as EU moves ahead with plans to label gas and nuclear as ‘green’","bodyText":"The European Commission is facing a furious backlash over plans to allow gas and nuclear to be labelled as “green” investments, as Germany’s economy minister led the charge against “greenwashing”. The EU executive was accused of trying to bury the proposals by releasing long-delayed technical rules on its green investment guidebook to diplomats on New Year’s Eve, hours before a deadline expired. The draft proposals seen by the Guardian would allow gas and nuclear to be included in the EU “taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities”, subject to certain conditions. The taxonomy is a classification system intended to direct billions to clean-energy projects to meet the EU goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Robert Habeck, who became the economy and climate action minister last month as part of a traffic-light coalition of Social Democrats, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens, said the plans “water down the good label for sustainability”. Habeck, a co-leader of the Greens, also told the German press agency dpa it was “questionable whether this greenwashing will even find acceptance on the financial market”. Austria’s government repeated its threat to sue the commission if the plans go ahead. Leonore Gewessler, the country’s climate action minister, said neither gas nor nuclear belonged in the taxonomy “because they are harmful to the climate and the environment and destroy the future of our children”. She added: “We will examine the current draft carefully and have already commissioned a legal opinion on nuclear power in the taxonomy. If these plans are implemented in this way, we will sue.” She also accused the commission of a “a night and fog operation” in the timing of the publication, a charge echoed by Luxembourg’s energy minister, Claude Turmes, who described the draft as a provocation. However, opponents are not expected to secure the supermajority needed to block the plans. France and other pro-nuclear states, such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, support the inclusion of nuclear, while many governments in central, eastern and southern Europe lobbied for gas to be included as a “bridge” fuel. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner of the FDP, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung on Sunday that Germany needed gas-fired power plants as a transition technology because it was foregoing coal and nuclear power. “I am grateful that arguments were apparently taken up by the commission,” he said. He was speaking after Germany closed three of its six nuclear power plants on Friday, to meet a pledge of phasing out the technology by the end of 2022. France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said the proposal was good on a technical level and the EU could not reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 without nuclear power. Under the draft, gas could only be classed as a “sustainable investment” if “the same energy capacity cannot be generated with renewable sources” and plans are in place to switch to renewables or “low carbon gases” by a specific date. Nuclear power could only be included if a project demonstrated it had a plan to deal with radioactive waste. NGOs accused the commission of seeking to evade scrutiny. WWF, a member of an official expert group on the taxonomy, said the commission had allowed just eight working days – until 12 January – to provide a formal response “to this highly complex and controversial file”, whereas most Brussels consultations last four weeks. “The European Commission couldn’t have tried harder to bury this proposal,” said the WWF spokesperson on sustainable finance, Henry Eviston. “For fossil gas and nuclear, we get a document written behind closed doors and published on New Year’s Eve. If the EU is confident in this proposal, it must hold a public consultation.” The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through “delegated acts” – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. The plans have already attracted the ire of Greta Thunberg and other young climate activists, who say this “fake climate action” contradicts the EU’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

It’s that wind that has made it a prized site for renewable energy projects. The northern inland New South Wales town is in the southernmost lobe of the New England Renewable Energy Zone (Rez), the northernmost of the five zones set up by the NSW government to cluster new wind and solar projects together for ease of storage and transmission. One project in development to make use of all that Walcha wind is the Winterbourne windfarm, the majority stakeholder of which is Danish renewable energy company Vestas. The project has been in development since 2004 and the company says it hopes to start building in 2024. The proposal involves building “up to 119” turbines with a maximum blade tip height of 230 metres across the north and east of the town. The proponents of the project say the turbines will be a boon to the region and its people, while opponents say it’s a risk to tourism, biodiversity and the town’s aesthetics. It’s a familiar argument, repeated up and down the east coast under a wave of new windfarm developments. Among the most vocal detractors is the former National party leader and New England MP, Barnaby Joyce, who has argued that the region should instead work to extend the life of its existing coal power stations until new nuclear technology is available. Joyce has found himself on the same side of at least some of the arguments with treechangers and local conservationists, concerned about the environmental impact of the proposed windfarm, and on the opposite side to a number of local farmers who see themselves on the frontline of climate change. ‘We need to diversify’ The Fletchers are one of the families willing to speak out in favour of Winterbourne. The land that’s been in their family since 1863 is slated to host some of the turbines. Warwick Fletcher, who runs sheep and cattle, sees it as a chance for Walcha to be at the forefront of renewable energy development. It is a win-win for farmers, he says: the royalties from hosting turbines will be a stable income stream; and the switch to renewables will lessen the impact of the climate crisis. “Our production is governed by rain,” Fletcher says. “We’ve had years where we had negative returns on assets, year in, year out. Everybody keeps telling us we can’t afford to rely on handouts – we need to diversify.” Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter For Warwick’s daughter, Holly, it is about future-proofing the farm. “We know the effects of climate change are real,” she says. “The people in the bush experience it more than anyone else in the country.” Walcha’s population of just over 3,000 is ageing. With younger workers forced to move away for employment, there’s less money in the town and fewer reasons to stay. The project comes with the promise of a $1m community development fund, with an additional $750,000 a year once the generators are turned on and a further $1,000 for every megawatt generated over 600MW. With a projected output of 700MW, that’s up to $850,000 a year for a town that sorely needs investment. Vestas also says the project will create up to 400 jobs during construction and 16 maintenance jobs once operational. The town needs the money. “The inequality [in Walcha] is incredible,” Fletcher says. It’s not the only project in the area: the first stage of the 720MW New England solar farm at Uralla, 40km from Walcha, opened on Wednesday. Other communities are cashing in. Fletcher is frustrated that Joyce, his local MP, and the National party, aren’t backing a project that is offering that level of financial support. “How many Nationals in federal parliament?” Fletcher says. “There’s going to be less and less people in the bush to vote for them.” An unlikely alliance of opponents Most of the opponents to the windfarm are concerned about the impact it may have on threatened species, as well as concerns about construction, turbine height, end-of-life of disposal of blades, noise, and the appropriateness of the community consultation. Others, like Barnaby Joyce, just oppose windfarms in general. Rachel and Cameron Greig are members of Voice For Walcha and are concerned about its proximity to Oxley Wild Rivers national park. “Winterbourne’s [environmental impact statement] describes the concentration as 0.66 wedgetail eagles per hectare per hour,” Rachel says. “At any other windfarm that they’ve got this measured for it goes from 0.11 to 0.44,” she says. “So it’s really one-and-a-half times higher than any other windfarms that they’ve mentioned. Wedgies get killed at these windfarms.” Most of their concerns come directly from the Winterbourne proposal documents. The EIS states the project will also “result in the loss of up to 206.73 hectares of potential habitat” for koalas and “a significant residual impact is considered likely”. The total cost of required environmental offsets will be $64.3m, the EIS states. The total cost of the project, Vestas says, will be $1.9bn. “It’s going to lead to loss of habitat to threatened species, including koalas, quolls and gliders,” Rachel Greig says. Cameron Greig argues that placing the turbines at the edge of the national park could potentially create an issue for aerial firefighting, by obstructing the bombers. “With turbines against that area, they’ve lost a pretty crucial tool to get control of those areas – in a smoky environment or in low cloud, those areas just become no-fly zones,” he says. The Rural Fire Service told Guardian Australia that wind turbines could be negotiated like any other obstacle. “Wind turbines are treated in the same way as other hazards across the landscape, such as power lines, radio or television transmission towers and mountains, all of which need to be taken into account in mission planning and by individual pilots,” a spokesperson said. Both Joyce, who has a property at nearby Woolbrook, and the National party state member for Northern Tablelands, Adam Marshall, attended a Voice for Walcha meeting in January in opposition to the project. Walcha was previously in the state electorate for Tamworth, but will fall under Northern Tablelands in the redrawn electoral boundaries for the 25 March poll. Marshall told the gathering the proposal contained “the very worst EIS I have ever, ever seen”. Joyce repeated calls for nuclear reactors to replace ageing coal-fired generators, instead of wind, and asked locals to march on Canberra. “I’m gonna tell you one thing: the [wind turbine] technology will be so out of date, it will be ridiculous. It will be antiquated,” Joyce told the crowd at the Walcha Bowling Club. “Personally, I believe that nuclear power will be in, and it’ll be something that would fit in this room that will do the job of thousands of wind turbines.” In a statement to Guardian Australia, Vestas says the company recognises “that change can be difficult and the transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy involves regional areas like Walcha”. It says it remains committed to engaging with the community openly and transparently. The Walcha mayor, Eric Noakes, says the council has taken a “neutral stance” on the project, with “councillors for it, councillors against it”. Noakes says the project has been “divisive” and he hopes the fault lines don’t run too deep. “We’ve always been a tight community – we’ve got to be a tight community to survive the tough times,” he says. “We’ll need our resilience as a community again one day.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2022/may/27/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-27T20:00:12Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/27/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/may/27/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A feature about nuclear energy stated incorrectly that there had been an estimated 10,000 deaths from all causes related to the Fukushima disaster, including 1,500 from cancer.

For now, many questions remain unanswered. Here are some of the main ones to look out for on Tuesday. 1. How much will this cost? Will Australian taxpayers be on the hook to subsidise the expansion of the US production line? And how on earth will we pay for it all? None of this will be cheap. Previous non-government estimates have put the long-term submarine program cost at anywhere between $116bn and $171bn, although these numbers were crunched before the full details were known. In an interview with Guardian Australia in January, the defence minister, Richard Marles, also did not rule out Australian taxpayers subsidising the expansion of US production prior to South Australian shipbuilding being ready to ramp up domestic production. This all comes at a time when the Australian government’s budget is already under pressure from competing and growing demands on a range of fronts – and when the Coalition is opposing modest savings. 2. How will we build up the nuclear expertise and other associated jobs to make this project work? Will the Royal Australian Navy recruit the crews needed to operate these larger submarines? The government estimates that Aukus will support some 20,000 jobs – including in the Australian Defence Force, the public service and private industry – over 30 years. This is meant to sound like a big win for Australia, but it also underlines the huge challenge looming to educate, train and recruit the specialists needed to make the plan a success. The Royal Australian Navy is expected to launch a recruitment drive soon, but it comes against a backdrop of pre-existing challenges. In a briefing to Marles last year, obtained under freedom of information laws, Defence warned: “The last year has seen lower recruiting achievement and higher separation rates, which have resulted in the ADF and [Department of Defence] workforce size being below approved levels.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup 3. Will it add a layer of unnecessary complexity for Australia to potentially operate two different types of nuclear-powered submarines at once? The Guardian reported last week that the long-term Aukus plan would likely involve a British submarine design with heavy use of American technology. But as an answer to the potential capability gap caused by the retirement of Australia’s existing Collins class conventional submarines from the late 2030s, Reuters reported Australia would buy three Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines from the US in the 2030s (with an option to buy two more). Some analysts have argued it will create complexity, duplication and cost for Australia to potentially run two classes of nuclear-powered submarines at once, so the government will be pressed to explain how these challenges can be met. 4. What are the plans for sovereign control and for how long will US or UK personnel and advisers have to travel on board the subs? The government – and the chief of its nuclear-powered submarine taskforce – have been unequivocal that Australian submarines will be under Australian command and control. But critics such as the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull have questioned whether this control will, in practice, be tempered by the need to continue to rely on US and UK personnel for technical and other support. V Adm Jonathan Mead acknowledged last week that Australia “will have assistance” and he likened this to other major defence programs, but added that the level of this assistance could reduce over time “as we develop more and more understanding of the technology”. Keep an eye out for what the government says on this point once the details are released. 5. Will the likely extended visits by US submarines to Australia in the meantime amount to a quasi-home-porting arrangement and how does that fit in with the prime minister’s assurances about maintaining sovereign control? Reuters reported that the US would forward-deploy some its own submarines in Western Australia by around 2027. The exact details of this arrangement between the Australian and US governments will be a key point of interest and Marles has previously played down the idea of “home-porting” foreign vessels in Australia. Canberra will likely argue the arrangement is no different from other rotational visits by US forces. 6. What assurances will the US give about loosening its export controls to actually make the Aukus plan work? Will Congress go along with it? Stringent export controls in the US have long been identified as a key obstacle to making Aukus work – including in the second pillar, the push to collaborate on other advanced military technologies not just submarines. On the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday, Joe Courtney – one of the biggest supporters of Aukus in the US Congress – expressed confidence the export controls issues could be resolved with a carveout similar to the one enjoyed by Canada. 7. When and how will construction begin on the first South Australian-built submarines and does that mean any slippage in political commitments that were made to that state? This will be a politically important issue for South Australia. When Aukus was first unveiled in 2021, the Morrison government said its intention was to build at least eight nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. Labor reaffirmed that intention and the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has been seeking assurances. But the timeframe for that work starting will be of interest, given that it seems an “off-the-shelf” solution has been found to plug the capability gap. 8. How will the three countries defend the nuclear non-proliferation precedent set by the deal and will any special arrangements be put in place to reassure the region? This is going to be a critical issue, given that China has been seeking to portray the arrangement as not in keeping with the spirit of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and Indonesia and Malaysia have previously expressed concerns. The significance of the deal is that two nuclear-weapons states will be handing nuclear tech to a non-nuclear-weapons state – and some experts have raised concerns about the precedent this may set for others. Australia is firm in declaring that it is only seeking nuclear-propelled (not nuclear-armed) submarines and that the NPT does not prohibit naval nuclear propulsion. Australia is in contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency and has promised to “implement the most stringent of security protocols”. The details, however, will be important. 9. What will happen to the nuclear waste when the submarines retire from service? The government says the reactor technology “means that future nuclear-powered submarines will not require refuelling during the service life of the boat, therefore Australia will not require a civil nuclear power industry”. But we just don’t know yet what the plans are for what happens to the nuclear waste at the end of the process. 10. How does the plan fit with future technological developments? Could they be more easily detectible by the time the new subs hit the water? The Australian National University’s National Security College report Transparent Oceans? found that scientific and technological advancements could make it increasingly difficult to hide the presence of submarines and predicted oceans were “likely” or “very likely” to become transparent by the 2050s. This does tend to raise some questions about the comparative benefits of nuclear-powered submarines to avoid detection – although Mead says the issue has been taken into account and that the subs could serve as a base from which uncrewed underwater vehicle operate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-ukrainians-flee-kherson-shelling-belarus-foreign-minister-dies-suddenly","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T17:59:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: UK confirms supply of missiles to Kyiv as Russian forces might be preparing to leave Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-ukrainians-flee-kherson-shelling-belarus-foreign-minister-dies-suddenly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-ukrainians-flee-kherson-shelling-belarus-foreign-minister-dies-suddenly","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: UK confirms supply of missiles to Kyiv as Russian forces might be preparing to leave Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s it from the UK blog team for today. Thank you for following our coverage. Here is a roundup of what we know on day 277 of the invasion. And a young couple’s account of helping citizens and Kyiv’s army during the Russian onslaught in Kherson. Hundreds of Ukrainians streamed out of Kherson city on Sunday to flee Russian shelling, two weeks after its recapture from Russian occupying forces prompted jubilant celebrations. The liberation of Kherson marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv – reconquered after the Russians retreated to the east bank of the Dnipro River. However, since then inhabitants have struggled with no water, heating and electricity, because Moscow’s troops destroyed thermal and power plants before they left. Evacuations began last week amid fears that damage to infrastructure caused by the war was too severe for people to endure over Ukraine’s harsh winter. The exodus has been exacerbated by Russian shelling, which has killed 32 civilians since Russian forces left the city on 9 November. “It is sad that we are leaving our home,” Yevhen Yankov told the Associated Press as a van he was in inched forward. “Now we are free, but we have to leave, because there is shelling, and there are dead among the population.” Ukraine only has enough power to cover 80% of its electricity needs, according to the country’s state grid operator Ukrenergo. It comes after Russia’s seventh attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure as part of a new strategy. Here’s a quick look at the latest news at it approaches 6pm in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm said on Sunday there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which they seized in March soon after their invasion. “One gets the impression they’re packing their bags and stealing everything they can,” Petro Kotin, head of Energoatom, said on national television. The UK Ministry of Defence has confirmed that as part of its aid package, the UK has provided Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to the Ukrainian armed forces. “This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” it said. The Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, was on the second day of an unannounced visit to Ukraine on Sunday. Accompanied by the Belgian foreign minister, Hadja Lahbib, De Croo used the visit to announce additional Belgian support of around €37.4m. Russian forces have suffered heavy casualties during fighting in Ukraine’s south-central Donetsk province and are unlikely to achieve a breakthrough there, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian airstrikes of the war. Russia kept up its onslaught on Ukrainian cities on Saturday with an attack on Dnipro which injured six people and destroyed seven houses, said the regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko. Thirty-two civilians have been killed in Kherson since 9 November, when Russian forces withdrew from the southern city they had occupied for eight months, the Kyiv Independent quoted Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, as saying. Since then, Russian troops have shelled Kherson frequently. Ukraine accused the Kremlin of reviving the “genocidal” tactics of Joseph Stalin as Kyiv commemorated a Soviet-era famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the winter of 1932-33. Volodymyr Zelenskiy hosted a summit in Kyiv with allied nations on Saturday to launch a “grain from Ukraine” initiative to export $150m worth of grain to countries most vulnerable to famine and drought. Up to 60 Ukrainian grain ships could be sent by the middle of next year to some of the world’s poorest countries in Africa, the Ukrainian president has said in a statement released to the Guardian. Belarus’s long-time foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, has “passed away suddenly”, the Belarusian state-run news agency Belta reported, without giving further detail. Belarus has been an ally of Russia and a base over the border for the invasion of Ukraine. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova posted on her Telegram channel that “we are shocked by the reports of the death”. Makei had been due to meet Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Minsk on Monday. The prime ministers of Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine – Ingrida Šimonytė, Mateusz Morawiecki and Denys Shmyhal, respectively – met in Kyiv on Saturday for talks to discuss and reiterate their commitment to work together “in countering Russia’s armed aggression”. Russia is firing ageing cruise missiles stripped of their nuclear warheads at Ukrainian targets because Vladimir Putin’s stocks are so depleted, the UK Ministry of Defence has suggested. An intelligence update from the ministry on Saturday said the desperate improvisation by the Russian president’s struggling forces were “unlikely to achieve reliable effects”. The head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm said on Sunday there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which they seized in March soon after their invasion, Reuters reports. Such a move would be a major battlefield change in the partially-occupied south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region where the frontline has hardly shifted for months. Repeated shelling around the plant has spurred fears of a nuclear catastrophe. “In recent weeks we are effectively receiving information that signs have appeared that they are possibly preparing to leave the [plant],” Petro Kotin, head of Energoatom, said on national television. “Firstly, there are a very large number of reports in Russian media that it would be worth vacating the [plant] and maybe worth handing control [of it)] to the [International Atomic Energy Agency],” he said, referring to the United Nations nuclear watchdog. “One gets the impression they’re packing their bags and stealing everything they can.” Russia and Ukraine, which was the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident in Chornobyl in 1986, have for months repeatedly accused each other of shelling the Zaporizhzhia reactor complex, which is no longer generating energy. Asked if it was too early to talk about Russian troops leaving the plant, Kotin said on television: “It’s too early. We don’t see this now, but they are preparing [to leave].” “All of the [Ukrainian] personnel are forbidden to pass checkpoints and travel to Ukrainian[-controlled] territory.” The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has likened Russia’s tactics in Ukraine to the Holodomor, a man-made famine engineered by Joseph Stalin that led to the deaths of millions of Ukrainians. Saturday was Holodomor Remembrance Day. The UK Ministry of Defence has confirmed that as part of its aid package, the UK has provided Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to the Ukrainian armed forces. ”This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” it said. My colleague Dalya Alberge has a story of a film studio that had to help the artists working out of its Kyiv branch flee the country when Russia invaded. The Kremlin has sought to play down reports that a Russian-led security alliance of former Soviet countries is weakening in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, called into question the effectiveness of the six-nation Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) at a summit this week. During a “family” photograph of leaders of countries in the CSTO in Yerevan on Wednesday, Pashinyan stepped away from Putin, who had been standing to his left. Pashinyan then refused to sign a summit declaration, as he railed against the recent failures of the CSTO, which ties Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan into a mutual defence agreement. Armenia’s criticism follows comments from Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, at the UN general assembly in September during which he implicitly criticised Russia’s war in Ukraine. On Sunday, Reuters reported that Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had said attempts to break up CSTO had always existed and would continue to do so, but insisted that the alliance remained in high demand despite criticism this week from Armenia. “There have always been attempts to [bring about] the CSTO’s disintegration,” news agencies quoted Peskov as saying in an interview broadcast on state television. “But at least now we see that, despite all the difficulties, despite the possible contradictions even between member countries, this structure remains in high demand,” he said. “And it fully demonstrated its relevance and effectiveness, meaning the resolution of the situation in Kazakhstan.” Russia, the dominant player in the CSTO, risks losing influence in parts of the former Soviet Union that it has long seen as its sphere of influence, as the conflict in Ukraine drags into its 10th month. The retired Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly, who embarked on the longest single space flight by an American, has visited Ukraine. Kelly, 58, a veteran of four space flights, visited the Okhmatdyt specialised children’s hospital. Some shocking images of the destroyed Antonivsky Bridge in Kherson have been published by AP photographer Bernat Armangué. The bridge, the main crossing point over the Dnipro River in Kherson, was destroyed by Russian troops earlier in November, after Kremlin forces withdrew from the southern city. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Russian army of deliberately destroying critical infrastructure during their withdrawal from the city, including electricity and water supplies. Ukrainian troops entered Kherson on 11 November after the Russian army had withdrawn from the city, which they captured in the early stage of the conflict, shortly after Russian troops had entered Ukraine in February 2022. The Associated Press news agency has filed this update on the ongoing shelling by Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine overnight. With persistent snowfall blanketing the capital, Kyiv on Sunday, analysts predicted that wintry weather — bringing with it frozen terrain and gruelling fighting conditions — could have an increasing impact on the direction of the conflict that has raged since Russian forces invaded Ukraine more than nine months ago. But for the moment, both sides were bogged down by heavy rain and muddy battlefield conditions in some areas, experts said. After a blistering barrage of Russian artillery strikes on at least two occasions over the past two weeks, infrastructure teams in Ukraine were fanning out in around-the-clock deployments to restore key basic services as many Ukrainians dealt with only a few hours of electricity per day — if any. Ukrenergo, the state power grid operator, said on Sunday that electricity producers are now supplying about 80% of demand. That’s an improvement from Saturday’s 75%, the company says. In the eastern Donetsk region, five people were killed in shelling over the past day, according to governor Pavlo Kyrylenko. Overnight shelling was reported by regional leaders in the Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk areas to the west. Kharkiv governor Oleh Syniehubov said one person was killed and three wounded in the northeastern region. The Belgium prime minister, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, is on the second day of an unannounced visit to Ukraine. Accompanied by Belgian foreign minister, Hadja Lahbib, De Croo used the visit to announce additional Belgian support of around 37.4 million euros. De Croo has been visiting different parts of the country including Bucha, where in April almost 500 bodies of residents were discovered in the streets of the city, victims of the Bucha massacre, the mass murder of Ukrainian civilians by Russian Armed Forces. The Belgian PM also visited Borodianka in Kyiv Oblast and was photographed standing in front of a recent Banksy mural, showing a small boy throwing a man, thought to represent Russian president Vladimir Putin, in judo attire over his shoulder. Most of the buildings in Borodianka, a small town on an important access road to Kyiv, have been destroyed by Russian bombings in the first months of the Russian invasion. Ukraine should take responsibility for any legal action against Russia because the West could “corrupt the process” for “cheap gas and oil”, a former international criminal prosecutor has told the Sunday Telegraph. Prof Sir Geoffrey Nice KC was the lead prosecutor against Slobodan Milosevic, the former president of Serbia, at the UN’s Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia between 1998 and 2006. He has been visiting Kyiv in recent months to discuss how perpetrators of potential war crimes might be held to account. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, he warned that “there are real risks of it subcontracting out” any legal action to the international community, saying it may end up with Crimea and the Donbas being sacrificed for a peace deal in exchange “for cheap oil and gas” for the West. He warned that foreign powers could pressure Ukraine into accepting “a negotiated settlement” that could compromise the Donbas and Crimea - Ukrainian regions invaded by Russia. Karim Ahmad Khan KC, the British barrister who serves as International Criminal Court’s (ICC) chief prosecutor, launched an investigation into alleged war crimes in Ukraine in March. But there has been no meaningful update since then. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has posted a message of support for Ukraine this morning on his official Twitter account, accompanied with a video narrated by Ukrainian voices. I believe in freedom. I believe we should stand up for the fundamental rights that matter so much to us all. For our sovereignty, for our self determination and for the foundations of a stable international order we are all fighting to restore. The Ukrainian people face bombing in the day and blackouts at night. But we know our friends will always be there to help see us through. The UK is one of our most steadfast allies. They give weapons for our battle, kit to keep us warm and friendship to restore our spirits. We know they will never let us down as we fight to win this war. With your help, we will secure our freedom. Together we will never back down, together we will be strong, together we will protect Ukraine and the freedoms we all cherish so much. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has warned rape in war violates international values as severely as the use of chemical weapons. Speaking to the Sunday Times on the eve of hosting a major international conference on preventing sexual violence in conflict in London, Cleverly said the “abhorrent act” is being used in Ukraine and other parts of the world. “This is an absolutely abhorrent act and yet we are seeing in Ukraine and other parts of world this is still being used as a weapon of war. We need to make sure that military commanders understand that it is just as unacceptable as the use of chemical weapons or as the killing or abuse of prisoners of war,” he said. Cleverly said he was horrified when he met victims in Yemen and Iraq as a junior foreign office minister two years ago. “It’s harrowing and now I ‘hear similar stories coming out from Ukraine and it never gets less painful,” he said. He had a chance to hear testimony first-hand in Ukraine where he spent two days seeing the missile damage that has left much of the country, including the British embassy, without power and water. More than 50 ministers from around the world are flying in, as well as 50 survivors from 20 countries from Colombia to South Sudan, including the Nobel peace prize winner Nadia Murad, a young Yazidi woman who has become a powerful advocate after being held as a sex slave by Islamic State fighters. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed on Saturday that Ukraine would continue to resist Russian attacks, as the country marked the 90th anniversary of the Holodomor famine that affected millions of Ukrainians under Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Agence France-Presse reported that several European leaders travelled to Ukraine to pledge support after weeks of Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy grid caused widespread power and water cuts as temperatures plunge with the onset of winter. Zelensky said in a video posted on social media: Once they wanted to destroy us with hunger, now – with darkness and cold. We cannot be broken. Leaders from Belgium, Lithuania and Poland were in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Saturday to commemorate victims of the 1932-33 Holodomor – Ukrainian for “death by starvation” – regarded by Kyiv as a deliberate act of genocide by Stalin’s regime. The Polish and Lithuanian prime ministers were also in Ukraine for talks that, according to local media, could focus on a possible new wave of migration from Ukraine this winter. The Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, paid his respects at a Holodomor memorial in Kyiv during his first visit to the country since Russia invaded. He posted photos on Twitter of him shaking hands with Zelenskiy, writing: Arrived in Kyiv. After the heavy bombing of recent days, we stand with the people of Ukraine. More than ever before. Belgium pledged a further €37.4m ($39m) of financial aid for Ukraine, the Belga news agency reported. Russian forces have suffered heavy casualties during fighting in Ukraine’s south-central Donetsk province and are unlikely to achieve a breakthrough there, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Its latest intelligence update said the area around the towns of Pavlivka and Vuhledar, in Ukraine’s east, had seen “intense combat” in the past two weeks but that little territory had changed hands. The ministry tweeted: Both Russia and Ukraine have significant forces committed to this sector, with Russian naval infantry having suffered heavy casualties. This area remains heavily contested, likely partially because Russia assesses the area has potential as a launch point for a future major advance north to capture the remainder of Ukrainian-held Donetsk Oblast. However, Russia is unlikely to be able to concentrate sufficient quality forces to achieve an operational breakthrough. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, have both announced new financial aid packages to support Ukrainian grain exports, which have been disrupted by the war. Macron said in a video statement: The most vulnerable countries must not pay the price of a war they did not want. Agence France-Presse also reported that the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, vowed the EU would continue to support Ukraine, accusing Russia of using “food as a weapon”. Heavy snowfall was expected in Kyiv starting on Sunday, with temperatures dropping below freezing day and night, while millions of people who still live in and around the Ukrainian capital remain with little electricity and heat. Reuters reported grid operator Ukrenergo as saying on Saturday that electricity producers were able to cover only three-quarters of consumption needs, necessitating restrictions and blackouts across the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said there were restrictions on the use of electricity in 14 of Ukraine’s 27 regions and in Kyiv, for “more than 100,000” customers in each of the regions. He said in his nightly video address: If consumption increases in the evening, the number of outages may increase. This once again shows how important it is now to save power and consume it rationally. Sergey Kovalenko, chief operating officer of Yasno, which provides energy to Kyiv, said the situation in the city had improved but remained “quite difficult.” He indicated residents should have at least four hours of power a day. Ukrainians have streamed out of Kherson to flee Russian shelling, just weeks after celebrating Ukraine’s recapture of the southern city. Associated Press reported that a line of trucks, vans and cars – some towing trailers or ferrying out pets and other belongings – stretched a kilometre or more on the outskirts of Kherson on Saturday. Days of intensive shelling by Russian forces prompted a bittersweet exodus: many civilians were happy that their city had been won back but lamented that they couldn’t stay. “It is sad that we are leaving our home,” said Yevhen Yankov, as a van he was in inched forward. Now we are free, but we have to leave, because there is shelling, and there are dead among the population. Poking her head out from the back, Svitlana Romanivna added: We went through real hell. Our neighborhood was burning, it was a nightmare. Everything was in flames. Emilie Fourrey, emergency project coordinator for aid group Doctors Without Borders in Ukraine, said an evacuation of 400 patients of Kherson’s psychiatric hospital, which is situated near both an electrical plant and the frontline, had begun on Thursday and was set to continue in the coming days. Russia has ratcheted up its attacks on critical infrastructure after suffering battlefield setbacks. A prominent Russian nationalist said Saturday that the Russian military didn’t have enough doctors – a rare public admission of problems within the military. Hello and welcome back to our ongoing live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Here’s a quick look at the latest news at it approaches 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. There are growing fears Russia’s relentless targeting of Ukraine’s electricity grid will threaten the safety of the country’s nuclear power plants, in the wake of the unprecedented emergency shutdown on Wednesday. Petro Kotin, the president of Ukraine’s nuclear power company, Energoatom, said all safety mechanisms had worked as intended on Wednesday but two generators were damaged in the process. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian air strikes of the war. Russia kept up its onslaught on Ukrainian cities on Saturday with an attack on Dnipro which injured six people and destroyed seven houses, said the regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko. Thirty-two civilians have been killed in Kherson since 9 November, when Russian forces withdrew from the southern city they had occupied for eight months, the Kyiv Independent quoted Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, as saying. Since then, Russian troops have shelled Kherson frequently. Ukraine accused the Kremlin of reviving the “genocidal” tactics of Josef Stalin as Kyiv commemorated a Soviet-era famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the winter of 1932-33. Volodymyr Zelenskiy hosted a summit in Kyiv with allied nations on Saturday to launch a “grain from Ukraine” initiative to export $150m worth of grain to countries most vulnerable to famine and drought. Up to 60 Ukrainian grain ships can be sent by the middle of next year to some of the world’s poorest countries in Africa, the Ukrainian president has said in a statement released to the Guardian.

Here is a round-up of the day’s main headlines: The EU has been urged to introduce a travel ban on Russian tourists with some member states saying visiting Europe was “a privilege, not a human right” for holidaymakers. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview with the Washington Post that the “most important sanction” was to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. China, which Russia has sought as an ally since being cold-shouldered by the west over its invasion of Ukraine, has called the US the “main instigator” of the crisis, Reuters reported. In an interview with the Russian state news agency Tass published on Wednesday, China’s ambassador to Moscow, Zhang Hanhui, accused Washington of backing Russia into a corner with repeated expansions of the Nato defence alliance Without claiming explicit responsibility for an attack on a Russian airfield in Crimea on Tuesday, Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said on Wednesday that it had destroyed nine Russian planes within the last 24 hours. It did not specify the locations. The claim follows widely reported explosions at Russia’s Saki air base. Crimea’s regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said some 250 residents were moved to temporary housing after dozens of apartment buildings were damaged, but Russian authorities have generally sought to downplay the explosions. Unverified social media footage purports to show damage to planes on the ground at the airport. Crimea’s regional ministry of health has said that one person died and 13 people were injured as a result of explosions at the air base near Novofedorivka. The Russian military have said that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area at the facility. Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014. The British defence secretary Ben Wallace said the UK has “pretty much dismissed” most of the Russian “excuses” for explosions at an air base in Crimea, and said he thinks the site would be a “legitimate target” for the Ukrainians. The United Nations expects to see a “big uptick” in applications for ships to export Ukraine grain after transit procedures were agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, a senior UN official said on Wednesday. The number of inbound vessels is expected to “grow in the near future” as grain deals are made, said Frederick Kenney, interim UN co-ordinator at the Joint Co-ordination Centre in Istanbul. Estonia has summoned the Russian ambassador and formally protested about the violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter on Tuesday, its foreign ministry said. “Estonia considers this an extremely serious and regrettable incident that is completely unacceptable,” the ministry said in a release, saying the helicopter had flown over a point in the southeast of the small Baltic nation without permission. In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not discuss who was behind the attacks but vowed to “liberate” Crimea, saying: “This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea – with its liberation.” An adviser to the president, Mikhail Podolyak, said Ukraine was not taking responsibility for the explosions, suggesting partisans might have been involved. Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are reorienting the plant’s electricity production to connect to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, according to Ukrainian operator Energoatom. “To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system. From August 7 to 9, the Russians have already damaged three power lines. At the moment, the plant is operating with only one production line, which is an extremely dangerous way of working,” Energoatom president Petro Kotin told Ukrainian television. The plant, located not far from the Crimean peninsula, has six of Ukraine’s 15 reactors, and is capable of supplying power for four million homes. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power firm warned of the “very high” risks from shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-occupied south and said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in time for winter. Energoatom’s chief, Petro Kotin, told Reuters in an interview that last week’s Russian shelling had damaged three lines that connect the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Ukrainian grid and that Russia wanted to connect the facility to its grid. Ukraine’s overseas creditors have backed its request for a two-year freeze on payments on almost $20 billion in international bonds, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday, a move that will allow the war-torn country to avoid a debt default. With no sign of peace or a ceasefire on the horizon nearly six months after Russia’s invasion began, bondholders have agreed to postpone sovereign interest and capital payments for thirteen Ukrainian sovereign bonds maturing between 2022 and 2033. Seven in 10 previous or current UK sponsors of Ukrainian refugees say their ability to provide support has been hindered by the cost of living crisis, figures have suggested. Some 21% of people who have hosted or are currently hosting Ukrainians in their homes said the rising cost of living has affected their ability to provide support “quite a lot”, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Russia’s daily military briefing for Wednesday has claimed to have shot down three Ukrainian planes overnight, and to have destroyed German-supplied anti-aircraft systems. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has said that in the last 24 hours two people have been killed and 25 civilians were injured in the territory it claims to control. That’s it from the Ukraine live blog for today. I’ll be back tomorrow morning but, for now, good night. The British defence secretary Ben Wallace said the UK has “pretty much dismissed” most of the Russian “excuses” for explosions at an air base in Crimea, and said he thinks the site would be a “legitimate target” for the Ukrainians. He told the BBC: I think when you just look at the footage of two simultaneous explosions not quite next to each other, and some of the reported damage even by the Russian authorities, I think it’s clear that that’s not something that happens by someone dropping a cigarette. Asked if the base was a legitimate target for the Ukrainians to strike, he said: First and foremost, Russia has illegally invaded, not just in 2014, but now Ukrainian territory. Ukraine, under United Nations articles, is perfectly entitled to defend its territory and take what action it needs to against an invading force. So, is it legitimate? It’s absolutely legitimate for Ukraine to take lethal force, if necessary, but take force in order to regain not only its territory, but also to push back its invader. And that air force base has been used by Russian air forces to bomb Ukrainian targets. So I think in anybody’s sort of manual of war it would be a legitimate target. Estonia has summoned the Russian ambassador and formally protested about the violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter on Tuesday, its foreign ministry said. “Estonia considers this an extremely serious and regrettable incident that is completely unacceptable,” the ministry said in a release, saying the helicopter had flown over a point in the southeast of the small Baltic nation without permission. Estonia made an identical complaint to Moscow in June, Reuters reported. The United Nations expects to see a “big uptick” in applications for ships to export Ukraine grain after transit procedures were agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, a senior UN official said on Wednesday. The number of inbound vessels is expected to “grow in the near future” as grain deals are made, said Frederick Kenney, interim UN co-ordinator at the Joint Co-ordination Centre in Istanbul, which oversees a deal between Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations to resume Ukraine grain exports. The EU has been urged to introduce a travel ban on Russian tourists with some member states saying visiting Europe was “a privilege, not a human right” for holidaymakers. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview with the Washington Post that the “most important sanction” was to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. Russians should “live in their own world until they change their philosophy”, he said. The Ukrainian president’s call was backed by Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, who tweeted that visiting Europe was “a privilege, not a human right”, adding: “Time to end tourism from Russia. Stop issuing tourist visas to Russians.” Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, has aired the same frustrations, telling public broadcaster YLE that it was “not right that while Russia is waging an aggressive, brutal war of aggression in Europe, Russians can live a normal life, travel in Europe, be tourists.” Finland has previously said that increasing numbers of Russians have begun crossing the 830-mile border between the two countries to shop in border stores and travel onwards to other EU destinations since Covid restrictions were lifted. Ukraine’s air force said it believed that up to a dozen Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground following Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which killed one, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine indicated the country had carried out the attack – but no public claim of responsibility was made by Kyiv of a dramatic incident that one expert believed may have been the product of a daring raid rather than a missile strike. Yuriy Ignat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, told national television that from studying video footage of the incident, it was clear “the aircraft weapons depot was hit”. He added: “And if additionally a dozen planes are destroyed there, it will be a real small victory.” Ukraine’s overseas creditors have backed its request for a two-year freeze on payments on almost $20 billion in international bonds, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday, a move that will allow the war-torn country to avoid a debt default. With no sign of peace or a ceasefire on the horizon nearly six months after Russia’s invasion began, bondholders have agreed to postpone sovereign interest and capital payments for thirteen Ukrainian sovereign bonds maturing between 2022 and 2033. The government in Kyiv launched a consent solicitation, which is a formal request to agree with creditors on changes to sovereign debt contracts, on 20 July, Reuters reported. Ukraine on Wednesday called on the European Union and G7 countries to stop issuing visas to Russian citizens, citing what he said was their support for the invasion of Ukraine. “Russians overwhelmingly support the war on Ukraine. They must be deprived of the right to cross international borders until they learn to respect them,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter. The tweet echoed earlier calls by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for a one-year travel ban and the apparent expulsion of Russians living in the West so they can live “in their own world until they change their philosophy”, Reuters reported. China, which Russia has sought as an ally since being cold-shouldered by the west over its invasion of Ukraine, has called the US the “main instigator” of the crisis, Reuters reported. In an interview with the Russian state news agency Tass published on Wednesday, China’s ambassador to Moscow, Zhang Hanhui, accused Washington of backing Russia into a corner with repeated expansions of the Nato defence alliance and support for forces seeking to align Ukraine with the European Union rather than Moscow. “As the initiator and main instigator of the Ukrainian crisis, Washington, while imposing unprecedented comprehensive sanctions on Russia, continues to supply arms and military equipment to Ukraine,” Zhang was quoted as saying. “Their ultimate goal is to exhaust and crush Russia with a protracted war and the cudgel of sanctions.” In case you missed it earlier today … Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us from Ukraine over the newswires. Without claiming explicit responsibility for an attack on a Russian airfield in Crimea on Tuesday, Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said on Wednesday that it had destroyed nine Russian planes within the last 24 hours. It did not specify the locations. The claim follows widely reported explosions at Russia’s Saki air base. Crimea’s regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said some 250 residents were moved to temporary housing after dozens of apartment buildings were damaged, but Russian authorities have generally sought to downplay the explosions. Unverified social media footage purports to show damage to planes on the ground at the airport. Ukraine has not directly taken credit for the strike, but few seem to give much credence to a Russian explanation that it was an accidental explosion. In its daily update, Ukraine’s army increased the number of planes it had claimed to have destroyed to 232 from 223. The Associated Press has spoken with Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov about the explosions. He said President Vladimir Putin has long insisted Crimea is Russian and warned that any attempts to take it back would trigger massive retaliation. He claimed Moscow’s apparent swallowing of the strike showed Putin’s weakness. “He’s expected to protect Crimea as Russia proper. Now he’s afraid to recognise that it was done by the Ukrainian armed forces,” he added. Russian warplanes have used Saki to strike at areas in Ukraine’s south. “Official Kyiv has kept mum about it, but unofficially the military acknowledges that it was a Ukrainian strike,” Zhdanov said. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said it couldn’t independently assess what caused the explosions, but noted that simultaneous explosions in two places at the base likely ruled out an accidental fire – but not the possibility of sabotage or a missile attack. But, it added: “The Kremlin has little incentive to accuse Ukraine of conducting strikes that caused the damage since such strikes would demonstrate the ineffectiveness of Russian air defence systems.” This is Martin Belam back on the live blog for an hour or so. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Seven in 10 previous or current UK sponsors of Ukrainian refugees say their ability to provide support has been hindered by the cost of living crisis, figures have suggested. Some 21% of people who have hosted or are currently hosting Ukrainians in their homes said the rising cost of living has affected their ability to provide support “quite a lot”, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. A further 9% said it affected their ability to help “very much” while 41% said it had been affected “a little”, PA Media reported. Twenty-six per cent said it had not affected their ability to help at all while 3% replied “don’t know”. Four Russian missiles hit a village on the southern outskirts of Ukraine’s city of Zaporizhzhia early on Wednesday, killing a 52-year-old woman, whose body was found in the rubble, the regional governor said. “Four private buildings have been totally destroyed. Several dozen houses have been left without windows and roofs,” governor Oleksandr Starukh wrote on Telegram. Rescue workers were still digging through the rubble hours later, the governor said. Electricity and gas supply to the village of Kushuhum were also disrupted, he added. A Ukrainian mother and her son prepare to leave Lisbon, where they went to flee the war two and a half months ago. Despite ongoing conflict with Russian forces in the south and east of the country, the UN Refugee Agency has reported more than 4.4m border crossings back into Ukraine since 28 February. Many of those crossing are thought to be Ukrainians heading back to parts of the country now considered relatively safe, hoping to reunite with family, rebuild their country and restart their lives. Katya and Nazar set off for Kyiv hoping to make it in time to celebrate Nazar’s ninth birthday. Russian authorities have raided the home of a former state TV journalist who quit after making an on-air protest against Moscow’s war in Ukraine. They have also launched a criminal case against her on the charge of spreading false information about Russian armed forces, her lawyer said on social media. The case against Marina Ovsyannikova was launched under a law, enacted after the 24 February invasion of Ukraine, that penalises statements against the military, lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said. If convicted, she faces up to 15 years in prison, the Associated Press reported. Zakhvatov told the independent news site Meduza the case is probably linked to a protest Ovsyannikova staged last month, holding a banner that said “Putin is a killer, his soldiers are fascists”. After the raid, Ovsyannikova is expected to be brought into the Investigative Committee for questioning, he said on Telegram. Ovsyannikova previously worked as a producer with the Russian state-funded Channel One. She made international headlines on 14 March when she appeared behind the anchor of an evening news broadcast holding a poster that said “stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here”. She was charged with disparaging the Russian military and fined 30,000 roubles (around £223.40 at the time). Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are reorienting the plant’s electricity production to connect to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, according to Ukrainian operator Energoatom. “To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system. From 7-9 August , the Russians have already damaged three power lines. At the moment, the plant is operating with only one production line, which is an extremely dangerous way of working,” Energoatom president Petro Kotin told Ukrainian television. The plant, located not far from the Crimean peninsula, has six of Ukraine’s 15 reactors, and is capable of supplying power for four million homes. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power firm warned of the “very high” risks from shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-occupied south and said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in time for winter. Energoatom’s chief, Petro Kotin, told Reuters in an interview that last week’s Russian shelling had damaged three lines that connect the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Ukrainian grid and that Russia wanted to connect the facility to its grid. Russia’s daily military briefing for Wednesday has claimed to have shot down three Ukrainian planes overnight, and to have destroyed German-supplied anti-aircraft systems. A Russian airbase deep behind the frontline in Crimea has been damaged by several large explosions that occurred on Tuesday, killing at least one person. It was not immediately clear whether it had been targeted by a long-range Ukrainian missile strike. Crimea’s regional ministry of health has said that, additionally 13 people were injured as a result of explosions at the airport in Novofedorivka. Ukraine’s army claims to have destroyed nine Russian planes in the last 24 hours. It did not specify the locations. The Russian military have said that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area at the facility. In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not discuss who was behind the attacks but vowed to “liberate” Crimea, saying: “This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea – with its liberation.” An adviser to the president, Mikhail Podolyak, said Ukraine was not taking responsibility for the explosions, suggesting partisans might have been involved. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has said that in the last 24 hours two people have been killed and 25 civilians were injured in the territory it claims to control. At least 13 people have been killed overnight by shelling in Marhanets in Dnipropetrovsk. Regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said more than 20 buildings were damaged. Ukraine’s emergency service has distributed images which appear to show a school in Marhanets damaged by an attack. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, said that as a result of shelling at around 1.40am Wednesday morning, three people, including a 13-year-old girl, were injured in the city of Mykolaiv. He said residential buildings were damaged as a result of shelling. The leaders of Estonia and Finland want fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take holidays in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine. The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, wrote on Tuesday on Twitter that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right” and that it was “time to end tourism from Russia now”, the Associated Press reported. Denmark will send military instructors to Britain to train Ukrainian soldiers and also aims to train Ukrainian officers in Denmark, the Danish defence minister said in an interview with the Jyllands-Posten newspaper published Wednesday. The US state department has approved $89m-worth of assistance to help Ukraine equip and train 100 teams to clear landmines and unexploded ordnance for a year, Reuters reported. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Tom Ambrose will be here shortly to continue our coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Denmark will send military instructors to Britain to train Ukrainian soldiers and also aims to train Ukrainian officers in Denmark, the Danish defence minister said in an interview with the Jyllands-Posten newspaper published today. Reuters reports the interview precedes a conference in Copenhagen on Thursday when British, Danish and Ukrainian defence ministers are expected to discuss long-term support for Ukraine, including military training, mine clearance and weapon supplies. “Within a short time, Denmark is sending 130 military instructors to a British training project,” defence minister Morten Bodskov told the newspaper. The Danish defence ministry had no immediate comment. Ukraine’s emergency services has issued some photographs this morning that it claims shows the damage in Marhanets after it was strike by Russian shelling. Early, the regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said at least 13 people died. Russia’s military briefing for the day has claimed to have shot down three Ukrainian planes overnight, and to have destroyed German-supplied anti-aircraft systems. It states that it has killed up to a further 130 Ukrainian service personnel. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces has issued updated figures this morning for the losses it says it has inflicted on pro-Russian forces. Notably, without specifying where it happened, today’s figures indicate they destroyed nine Russian planes or helicopters in the last 24 hours. It claims to have killed “about 42,800” military personnel in total since 24 February, an increase of 160 on the day before. It also said: “The opponent suffered the biggest losses in the Donetsk direction.” The daily operational briefing from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has claimed that in the last 24 hours two people have been killed and 25 civilians were injured in the territory it claims to control. It says this came after Ukrainian forces shelled 10 of the 266 settlements it claims have been “liberated” from Ukrainian forces. It says 72 houses and nine civil infrastructure facilities were damaged. None of the claims have been independently verified. The DPR is recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states, including Russia. This morning we have been sent some images over the newswires from inside occupied Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. The pictures were taken on a trip organised by the Russian military, and appear designed to show that ordinary work and life continues under the auspices of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). Several of the photographs were taken at a coal mining operation in Dolzhansk. The LPR was formed in 2014, and is recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. One image released shows the leader of the self-proclaimed LPR, Leonid Pasechnik, attending a movie premiere for a film entitled Match, which glorifies the actions of Soviet Union soldiers during the second world war. Another part of the trip appears to have been to demonstrate that an equestrian school was running as normal. The RIA Novosti news agency is reporting that Crimea’s regional ministry of health has said that 13 people were injured and one died as a result of explosions at the airport in Novofedorivka. It quotes the authority’s statement saying: “As of 8.30am, as a result of an incident in the urban-type settlement of Novofedorivka, Saki district, 13 people were injured and one person died.” RIA goes on to report that “one person was hospitalised in the Saki regional hospital, another 10 patients with minor injuries, including two minors, received medical care on an outpatient basis. Two more victims went to Simferopol hospital No 6, after rendering assistance they were allowed to go home.” The claims have not been independently verified, and the cause of the explosions remains somewhat unclear. Ukraine’s presidential adviser Mykhail Podolyak has denied Ukrainian responsibility for an attack, and the Russian military have said only that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area. There is some clarification here on the numbers killed overnight in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Reuters reports governor Valentyn Reznichenko now says that at least 13 people died after shelling there. He said more than 20 buildings were damaged in Marhanets, a city across the Dnipro River from the Russian-captured Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. The attack damaged a power line, leaving several thousand people without electricity, Reznichenko said. The attack damaged a hostel, two schools, a concert hall, the main council building and other administrative bases, he added. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians, despite the evidence of damage to civil infrastructure in Ukrainian cities, towns and villages. Lviv’s governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, has said the night passed without incident in his western region of Ukraine. He said that 306 people arrived in evacuation trains from the east of the country, where the fighting is concentrated. He said that 761 left on evacuation trains to Poland. Here are some of the latest images we have been sent from inside Ukraine and Crimea over the newswires. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has posted to Telegram to say that as a result of shelling at around 1.40am, three people, including a 13 year-old girl, were injured in the city of Mykolaiv. He said residential buildings were damaged as a result of shelling. He also claimed that yesterday, during the day, there had been several fires in the fields caused by Russian attacks, and that “settlements of the Bereznehuvate community, located on the demarcation line, remain under constant fire”. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam with the live blog in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Ukrainian officials are reporting that 11 people were killed and 13 wounded by Russian shelling in the Nikopol district in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region overnight. Residential homes were reportedly damaged in the attack and as many as 1,000 people are without gas, the regional regional military administration said. Russian commanders are likely to be faced with the competing operational priorities of reinforcing the Donbas offensive, and strengthening defences against anticipated Ukrainian counter attacks in the south. To support the Ukraine operation, Russia has “almost certainly” established a major new ground forces formation, 3rd Army Corps (3 AC), based out of Mulino, in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast east of Moscow, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. The latest British intelligence report reads: Russia likely plans to resource a large proportion of 3 AC from newly formed ‘volunteer’ battalions, which are being raised across the country, and which group together recruits from the same areas. Russian regional politicians have confirmed that potential 3 AC recruits are being offered lucrative cash bonuses once they deploy to Ukraine. Recruitment is open to men up to 50 years old and with only middle-school education. A Russian army corps typically consists of 15-20,000 troops, but it will probably be difficult for Russia to bring 3 AC up to this strength, given very limited levels of popular enthusiasm for volunteering for combat in Ukraine. 3 AC’s effect is unlikely to be decisive to the campaign.” The US state department has approved $89m worth of assistance to help Ukraine equip and train 100 teams to clear landmines and unexploded ordnance for a year, officials said in a statement on Tuesday. The funding is the largest US de-mining program yet in Ukraine, and the official compared Ukraine’s challenge to attempts to disarm unexploded ordnance in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos following the American war of the 1960s and 70s in Southeast Asia. “If you look at some conflicts in the not so distant past, the Vietnam War for example, we’re still clearing ordnance in Southeast Asia 50 years after that war ended. This may be on par with that,” the official said. The program would be run through contractors and non-governmental organisations the official said. He said the money, part of which comes from Ukraine-linked budget requests, will not only fund training, but specialised mine detection and earth moving equipment if need be. A Ukrainian official said the aid addressed one of the country’s most important tasks. “By our estimates, 160,000 square kilometres of Ukrainian land need de-mining, which is about the size of Virginia, Maryland and Connecticut combined,” said Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s top aide. “This aid will accelerate Ukraine’s recovery,” Zelenskiy’s chief of staff said in a Telegram post. US president Joe Biden formally welcomed Finland and Sweden joining the Nato alliance Tuesday as he signed the documents of ratification that delivered the US’s formal backing of the Nordic nations entering the mutual defence pact. The move is the most significant expansion of the military alliance since the 1990s as it responds to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In seeking to join Nato, Finland and Sweden are making a sacred commitment that an attack against one is an attack against all,” Biden said at the signing as he called the partnership the “indispensable alliance.” Finland and Sweden’s decision to join Nato is a watershed moment for our Alliance. It will help ensure greater security and stability for our world,” Biden added. On a slightly lighter note, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is being made into an action figure by a product design company in Brooklyn, New York. FCTRY launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production two weeks ago, hitting its $30,000 funding goal in just three hours and raising more than $120,000 since. For every figure sold, $1 goes to Ukraine in the campaign which ends on Friday. A six-inch (15-cm) tall clay prototype of the Zelenskiy action figure, moulded by Seattle artist Mike Leavitt, will be mass produced in plastic in China. It is expected to ship by March. “The way we framed him in the campaign is ‘the unlikely hero,’” said Jason Feinberg, FCTRY’s chief executive and creative director. “He’s the perfect leader for this moment, just this super inspirational character. He has this real strength that comes across, but it’s humble and he sort of represents the opposite of everything that we’ve come to associate with politics.” In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not discuss who was behind the attacks in Crimea but vowed to “liberate” the region. This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea - with its liberation. Russia has turned our peninsula, which has always been and will be one of the best places in Europe, into one of the most dangerous places in Europe. But we will return to the Ukrainian Crimea. From the Kharkiv region to Kherson, from Donetsk to Enerhodar, from Stanytsia Luhanska to Yalta, from Berdyansk to Novofedorivka – these are all parts of our country, this is Ukraine, which will be completely free.” Ukraine is not taking responsibility for explosions at a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, suggesting partisans might have been involved. Mykhail Podolyak, asked by the Dozhd online television channel whether Kyiv was taking responsibility, replied: “Of course not. What do we have to do with this?” Earlier, he appeared to suggest the strike could herald a new phase of the conflict. Podolyak said that Kyiv’s long-term goal was “demilitarisation of the Russian Federation”. He added: “The future of the Crimea is to be a pearl of the Black Sea, a national park with unique nature and a world resort. Not a military base for terrorists. It is just the beginning.” Ukraine’s defence ministry said it could not determine the cause of the explosions but added, sardonically, that people should have regard for the rules of fire safety and “the prohibition of smoking in unspecified places”. A Russian airbase deep behind the frontline in Crimea has been damaged by several large explosions, killing at least one person. Multiple social media videos showed explosions and clouds emerging from the Saky military base in Novofedorivka on the western coast of Crimea on Tuesday afternoon, prompting questions about how a location more than 100 miles (160km) from the frontline could have been attacked. Russia’s defence ministry told the RIA Novosti news agency that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area. It is not clear whether it had been targeted by a long-range Ukrainian missile strike. Russian tourists holidaying on beaches nearby could be seen leaving in fear. It is one of few occasions that the peninsula, occupied by Russia since 2014, has been directly affected by the latest fighting. Local people told one Russian news site that explosions went on for an hour. Sergey Aksyonov, the Russian-appointed head of occupied Crimea, said one person had died. Earlier, he had filmed a video statement near the site, with smoke rising in the distance, saying that ambulance crews and medics were on the scene. Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeast Ukraine are preparing to connect the plant to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, and are damaging it by reorienting its electricity production, Ukrainian operator Energoatom warned. Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and was occupied by Russia early in its invasion. Energoatom president Petro Kotin told Reuters news agency that Russia wanted to connect the plant to its grid, a technically difficult process that requires the facility to be severed from the Ukrainian system before it can be gradually connected to the Russian one. Their plan is to damage all the lines from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. After that it will not be connected to the Ukrainian power system,” he said. Kotin also told Ukrainian television and Interfax news agency: The Russian military present at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are implementing the program of [Russian operator] Rosatom aimed at connecting the plant to the Crimean electricity grid. To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system. From August 7 to 9, the Russians have already damaged three power lines. At the moment, the plant is operating with only one production line, which is an extremely dangerous way of working. When the last production line is disconnected, the plant will be powered by generators running on diesel. Everything will then depend on their reliability and fuel stocks.” The process of de-energisation of the plant in preparation to connect to Russia would be extremely dangerous, Kotin warned. At the ZNPP, we are already very close to this first stage of Fukushima-1, because there is only one line. As soon as it is turned off, the station will switch to diesel, and after that everything will depend on the reliability of their work and the sufficiency of the fuel that is there for diesel engines at the ZNPP.” Kotin also spoke with CNN, reiterating his claims that the ultimate plan of the Russians is to disconnect the plant from powering Ukraine and connect it to the grid to power occupied Crimea. If there is no connection to the grid, then you cannot provide electricity from the outside, then the diesel generators will start. But everything will depend on the reliability of those generators. … This is a dangerous situation, because if those stop you could have a disaster of melting nuclear materials,” he said, comparing the potential fallout to the Fukishima disaster in Japan. If the situation worsens, we need to think about our population at the plant. We are planning on how, during war conditions, we will be able to evacuate the personnel. Great release of radioactivity could happen from there. There could be a cloud, a radioactive cloud.” Located not far from the Crimean peninsula, the plant has six of Ukraine’s 15 reactors, capable of supplying power for four million homes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday raised the spectre of nuclear disaster after strikes on the plant. And UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that any attack on a nuclear plant would be “suicidal”. “I hope that those attacks will end, and at the same time I hope that the IAEA will be able to access the plant,” he said Monday. Recent fighting around the plant has prompted the UN nuclear watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to warn of the “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Ukraine has denied responsibility for explosions at a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, suggesting partisans might have been involved. Meanwhile, Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeast Ukraine are preparing to connect the plant to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, and are damaging it by reorienting its electricity production, Ukrainian operator Energoatom warned. It is 7.30am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: A Russian airbase deep behind the frontline in Crimea has been damaged by several large explosions, killing at least one person. It was not immediately clear whether it had been targeted by a long-range Ukrainian missile strike.

The US state department has approved $89m worth of assistance to help Ukraine equip and train 100 teams to clear landmines and unexploded ordnance for a year, Reuters reported. The total number of grain-carrying ships to leave Ukrainian ports under a UN brokered deal to ease the global food crisis has now reached 12, with the two latest ships which left on Tuesday headed for Istanbul and Turkey. Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad has been struggling with quotas imposed by the EU for sanctioned goods that it can import across Lithuania from mainland Russia or Belarus, the region’s governor admitted. Lithuania infuriated Moscow in June by banning the land transit of goods such as concrete and steel to Kaliningrad after EU sanctions on them came into force, Reuters reported. Russia has launched an Iranian satellite from Kazakhstan amid concerns it could be used for battlefield surveillance in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Iran has denied that the Khayyam satellite, which was delivered into orbit onboard a Soyuz rocket launched from Baikonur cosmodrome, would ever be under Russian control. But the Washington Post previously reported that Moscow told Tehran it “plans to use the satellite for several months, or longer, to enhance its surveillance of military targets” in Ukraine, according to two US officials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-379-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T15:07:41Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 379 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-379-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-379-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 379 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it had been “a difficult night” as Russian strikes hit targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, reported five people had been killed in a strike on the Zolochiv district. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, said two women in their 70s had been injured by a strike on Pisochyn. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, reported that three people were killed in the southern city of Kherson. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes as without military purpose and “just Russian barbarism”. The strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for ten days,” the company said in a statement. In a statement, Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the site’s safety and security. He said: “This is the sixth time that the plant has lost all off-site power and has had to operate in this emergency mode. Each time we are rolling a dice, and if we allow this to continue then one day our luck will run out.” Zelenskiy has said he will not meet Vladimir Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraine’s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet Putin, Zelenskiy said: “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word” and “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that.” Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia was among the countries that had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistria’s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. The Kremlin said on Thursday it doubted the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have been carried out without state support, after the New York Times reported that a pro-Ukrainian non-government group might have been responsible for the blasts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was vital to identify who was behind the attacks which ruptured the multi-billion dollar pipelines last September. He added that it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. Ukraine will take part in European Union countries’ scheme to jointly buy gas, the bloc’s energy policy chief said on Thursday. Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the country’s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter. The city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s east, could fall in the next few days, said the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. “What we see is that Russia is throwing more troops, more forces and what Russia lacks in quality they try to make up in quantity. They have suffered big losses, but at the same time, we cannot rule out that Bakhmut may eventually fall in the coming days,” he said on Wednesday. The founder of the mercenary Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, which has been leading the Russian assault on Bakhmut, said on Wednesday Russian forces now fully control the east of the city. The claims have not been independently verified. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in its Wednesday morning report: “The enemy, despite significant losses, continues to storm the town of Bakhmut.” Russia is unlikely to capture significantly more territory this year, according to the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines. She told a Senate hearing on Wednesday that the military will probably be unable to carry on its current level of fighting, even with the possible capture of Bakhmut. The Pentagon has been accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The defence department is said to be firmly opposed to using The Hague-based ICC, as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers. Zelenskiy has invited the US House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyiv’s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelenskiy proposed the visit in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. The US obtained a warrant to seize a Boeing aircraft owned by Russian oil company Rosneft that is valued at over $25m (£21m), the US justice department said. The district court for the eastern district of New York authorised the seizure, based on violations of export controls and sanctions against Russia, the department said. In a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Wednesday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, told journalists it was “critical” that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed, with Ukraine traditionally being one of the world’s largest exporters of grain. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. The Kremlin, however, said on Thursday there were still “a lot of questions” remaining over the deal, and that there were currently no plans for a direct meeting with Guterres. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Wednesday he had suggested the bloc spend €1bn (£890m) for the joint procurement of ammunition for Ukraine and to refill their own stockpiles. “I propose to mobilise another €1bn,” Reuters reported he told the media after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Stockholm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-280-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-30T11:37:47Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 280 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-280-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-280-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 280 of the invasion","bodyText":"The EU will try to set up a court, backed by the UN, to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, according to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. In a video statement, she said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought death, devastation and unspeakable suffering. We all remember the horrors of Bucha. It is estimated that more than 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far.” Moscow has promoted the chief engineer of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Yuriy Chernichuk, to become its head, according to Russia’s nuclear agency Rosenergoatom. The position has been vacant since October, when Kyiv says the plant’s boss Ihor Murashov was abducted by Russian authorities. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram early on Wednesday morning that Russian strikes in the region overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. Ukraine claims to have killed another 500 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours, bringing the total it says have died in combat since 24 February to about 88,880. The general staff of the armed forces said it had taken out three more tanks, and another six armoured personnel carriers. Ukrainian forces have downed three Russian reconnaissance drones in the last 24 hours, according to its armed forces. In an early morning bulletin from Ukraine, the spokesperson for the general staff of the armed forces, Alexander Štupun, said Ukraine had been subjected to a number of missile attacks from planes and artillery, including on Kivsharivka in Kharkiv and Sloviansk in Donetsk. Both are in Ukraine’s east. Five Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces on Tuesday, according to a senior government official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, posted on Telegram that the five were all killed in Donetsk, with 15 people also injured. The Donetsk region has continued to face shelling by Russian troops. Others were wounded in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems. Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. The head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, spoke to Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday morning. They discussed the US’s support for the Grain from Ukraine scheme, which is running to get grain out of the port of Odesa, and its support for Ukraine over the winter months. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has highlighted Russia’s new foreign agents act in its daily update, which the MoD says will be used to crack down on critics and dissidents. Vladimir Putin has changed the existing 2012 law to mean that the personal details, including the address, of designated “foreign agents” can be published – meaning they could become targets of harassment. It will come into force on Thursday. The European Commission gave an update on Wednesday on its plans to freeze and confiscate Russian assets. “We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU’s executive. Nato doubled down on Tuesday on its commitment to one day include Ukraine, a pledge that some officials and analysts believe helped prompt Russia’s invasion this year. The world’s largest security alliance also pledged to send more aid to Ukrainian forces locked in battle with Russian troops. Ukraine’s supplies of spare parts for its battered electricity grid are running out amid sustained Russian bombing. European companies are being asked to urgently donate surplus kit to help the country get through the winter, after the latest step in Russian bombings targeting power plants and substations resulted in power cuts lasting 48 hours or more across the country. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato against providing Ukraine with Patriot missile defence systems and called the alliance a “criminal entity”. “If, as [Nato secretary general Jens] Stoltenberg hinted, Nato were to supply the Ukrainian fanatics with Patriot systems along with Nato personnel, they would immediately become a legitimate target of our armed forces,” Medvedev wrote on Telegram. Ukrainian forces struck a power plant in multiple attacks on Russia’s Kursk region on Tuesday, causing some electricity outages, the local governor said. “In total, there were about 11 launches. A power plant was hit,” Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region, said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility and made no immediate comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/war-in-ukraine-what-we-know-on-day-nine-of-the-russian-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T14:59:59Z","webTitle":"War in Ukraine: what we know on day nine of the Russian invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/war-in-ukraine-what-we-know-on-day-nine-of-the-russian-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/war-in-ukraine-what-we-know-on-day-nine-of-the-russian-invasion","fields":{"headline":"War in Ukraine: what we know on day nine of the Russian invasion","bodyText":"Russian troops have seized Europe’s largest nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia after a fire sparked by heavy shelling, Ukrainian authorities said. No changes in radiation had been recorded but any loss of ability to cool nuclear fuel would lead to “significant radioactive emissions” that could “outgrow all previous nuclear power plant accidents”, they said. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, offered to travel to Ukraine to facilitate talks with Russia aimed at guaranteeing the safety of nuclear plants during the conflict. The situation “continues to be extremely tense and challenging,” he said. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has warned the days to come are “likely to be worse”, calling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades”. But he stressed Nato was a “defensive alliance” and not seeking a war with Russia. Stoltenberg said foreign ministers discussed a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine but agreed that Nato planes should not operate over Ukrainian airspace. He also said Nato had evidence Russia was using cluster bombs. In a call with Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin dismissed as “propaganda fakes” reports of missile strikes on large cities. He said Russia was open to dialogue but only if its demands – the neutral, non-nuclear status of Ukraine, its “denazification”, recognition of Crimea as Russian and the “sovereignty” of separatist territories in eastern Ukraine – were met. Putin, also warned Russia’s neighbours “not to escalate the situation” by imposing more restrictions on his country, adding: “There are no bad intentions towards our neighbours … We fulfil all our obligations and will continue to fulfil them.” Russian forces intensified their bombardment of cities in eastern and southern Ukraine after taking control of Kherson on Thursday, causing devastating damage. Mariupol remains encircled, Russian soldiers entered Mykolayiv, and Kharkiv, the country’s secojnd city, was again heavily shelled. US secretary of state Anthony Blinken said Washington was “committed to doing everything we can to make this stop”, adding that the west was “faced together with what is President Putin’s war of choice: unprovoked, unjustified, and a war that is having horrific, horrific consequences for real people.” More than 1.2m people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February, the UN said, including about half a million children. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed directly to Russians to protest over the seizure of nuclear power infrastructure by Russian troops. “Russian people, I want to appeal to you: how is this possible?” he said. “After all, we fought together in 1986 against the Chernobyl catastrophe.” Zelenskiy earlier accused Russia of “nuclear terror”, as British PM Boris Johnson said Putin’s forces were “reckless”. US president Joe Biden and Canada’s Justin Trudeau also condemned Russia for shelling the plant. Russia’s defence ministry blamed the attack on the nuclear plant on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a “monstrous provocation”. Ukraine and Russia agreed to try to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks on Thursday, but with no plans for how they might be implemented. A third round is set to take place next week. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russians to rally around their president and said that what happened next would depend on Kyiv’s stance in talks, adding that Russia had “clearly conveyed to the Ukrainian side our vision of solving this problem”. The UN Human Rights Council overwhelmingly voted to create a top-level investigation into violations committed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with 32 members of the 47-seat council in favour and only Russia and Eritrea voting against. Russia’s parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” information about the armed forces. Russia admitted to “limiting” access to news websites including the BBC, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the independent Russian site Meduza and Germany’s Deutsche Welle, with Facebook also blocked."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/15/wind-hydrogen-no-demolitions-how-next-pm-can-put-uk-on-net-zero-path","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T05:00:30Z","webTitle":"Wind, hydrogen, no demolitions: how next PM can put UK on net zero path","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/15/wind-hydrogen-no-demolitions-how-next-pm-can-put-uk-on-net-zero-path","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/15/wind-hydrogen-no-demolitions-how-next-pm-can-put-uk-on-net-zero-path","fields":{"headline":"Wind, hydrogen, no demolitions: how next PM can put UK on net zero path","bodyText":"There is little mention of Boris Johnson’s “green industrial revolution” on the campaign trail of the two Conservative party leadership candidates. Maybe it’s not surprising when Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are focused on formulating plans to deal with the more immediate energy crisis. That said, Labour and the Liberal Democrats are pressing ahead with announcing the investments they would make to achieve net zero by 2050. A new prime minister could do worse than crack on with some of the plans in Johnson’s 10-point programme, announced to great fanfare in 2020. The plans are behind schedule and several of the ideas are considered by experts to be dead ends. The CBI has accused the government of relying too heavily on private-sector investment, which it blames for Britain falling behind Europe and the US. The Biden administration is poised to pass a near $370bn bill to promote climate-friendly infrastructure. Johnson’s 10-point plan committed the government to spending £12bn. The government’s own adviser, the Climate Change Committee, said the money on offer needed to be closer to £50bn to make a difference. Nevertheless, piecing together the ideas and investment needed to create a zero-carbon economy is achievable and could create more sustainable jobs, if the new regime can decide what it wants to do. Offshore wind The offshore wind industry has put the UK in the front rank of countries managing the switch away from fossil fuels. More arrays in the sea are planned on the east and west coast. Official figures show that meeting net zero targets would mean cutting gas use by 65% by 2035, and almost 100% by 2050. At the moment gas accounts for about 90% of home heating and 40% of electricity generation. At 37%, heating accounts for the largest proportion of UK greenhouse gas emissions. Kwasi Kwarteng, a chief ally of Truss’s, said this year he would expand onshore wind, helping speed up the transition. While the UK has only limited capacity to make wind turbines, and the number of jobs created by businesses servicing windfarms is small in relation to the size of the investment, the employment is highly skilled and expert firms could export their knowhow. Sunak said at a recent hustings that regulations governing offshore wind, rooftop solar and nuclear would be overhauled to scale up supply, despite the critics arguing that solar is held back by a lack of power storage facilities and all renewables are at the mercy of an electricity grid in desperate need of an upgrade to cope with a coal, oil and gas-free world. Low-carbon hydrogen The UK’s ambition for hydrogen production was recently doubled to 10 gigawatts by 2030. Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable electricity to drive an electrolyser that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The gas is burned to produce power, emitting water vapour, warm air, and no carbon greenhouse gases. But, depending on the method of burning, it can also cause health-harming air pollution and, as a climate-heating gas itself, any leakage of hydrogen could offset some of the advantages of its use. A favourite of the Tees Valley mayor, Ben Houchen, hydrogen is also seen as the green fuel of the future by the car company Toyota and the Spanish energy firm Iberdrola, which owns Europe’s largest production site for green hydrogen for industrial use, at Puertollano in Spain. Iberdrola’s subsidiary Scottish Power plans to use government subsidies to build a 100 megawatt plant at Felixstowe to provide enough fuel to power 1,300 hydrogen trucks operating inside the port from 2026. Hydrogen cells could take over from diesel to power trucks, farm equipment and diggers, but there would need to be significant funding to create a UK industry. Nuclear power There is a new power station taking shape at Hinkley Point in Somerset and the government has approved another at the Sizewell site in Suffolk at an expected cost of £20bn. Both will be built by the French electricity company EDF. The Sizewell C site could be challenged if local people pursue an appeal over the next few weeks. The CBI boss, Tony Danker, has urged the government to push on with the investment, and Sunak has promised to go ahead should he become leader, presumably whatever challenges lie ahead. Delays and cost overruns are likely and could help Rolls-Royce, which expects to have a series of mini-nuclear power stations ready by the end of the decade, though these have faced their own time and cost overruns. Zero-emission vehicles Britain spends about £27bn on new roads but very little on subsidising electric car production or the infrastructure of charging points that supports electric vehicles. Car firms, almost all of them foreign-owned, have complained that subsidies for UK production are small. Car parts suppliers have little incentive to adapt to electric cars. The battery maker BritishVolt is on “life support” as it wrestles with funding problems. Green public transport, cycling and walking Public transport is becoming green as electric buses become more popular. Electric cycles and scooters are being adopted at a rapid pace in some towns and cities. Cars are being forced to lower their speed in built-up areas. But pedestrians are being left out of schemes to create more livable cities, persuading families to stick with the suburbs and new housing estates that rely on private car travel. More investment in electric-powered trains would create jobs and make links across the railway network more reliable. There are plans to electrify the Midland mainline and the Transpennine route and upgrade the east coast mainline, but with HS2 likely to be stopped at Manchester, the spur to Leeds abandoned and HS3 across the northern cities scrapped, the opportunities to revive the push for electrification are many. The payback from integrating cycling, walking and public transport will be significant, as the Netherlands and Denmark have found. Greener buildings A building with solid walls built before the second world war costs about £20,000 to insulate and between £10,000 and £20,000 for a heat pump. There are about 8m of these homes. Even the best-insulated homes gain a category B certificate when an A is needed to meet zero carbon targets. It means even those built or refurbished in the last 30 years will need another facelift. And before embarking on this investment, ministers must stop developers checking their own homework. There are concerns that builders are cutting corners knowing local authorities lack the staff to check on them. Sunak or Truss could also put a moratorium on the demolition of existing commercial and residential buildings. The UK would put itself at the forefront of a global construction industry that focuses on refurbishing existing structures to make them low-carbon. Most architects and developers remain attached to the idea of constructing new buildings, but western countries have most of what they need if the current stock is upgraded and empty homes are brought back into use. Natural environment Protecting nature has obvious benefits. Sunak commissioned a 360-page report from the eminent Cambridge economist Partha Dasgupta detailing how the economy will suffer unless we protect the natural environment, but didn’t say what action he would take. Chancellors always delay taking action because while they understand investments create jobs and save the exchequer money in the future from flooding and drought, it is less clear how it creates businesses that generate tax income or export cash. • This article was amended on 18 August 2022. An earlier version said that no greenhouse gases are emitted when green hydrogen is burned; that meant to refer to carbon greenhouse gases. It was further amended on 14 November 2022 to provide more details about the possible effects of using green hydrogen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/feb/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-moscow-row-over-crimes-against-humanity-claims","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-19T19:31:37Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: shelling kills three in southern city of Berislav – as it happened ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/feb/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-moscow-row-over-crimes-against-humanity-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/feb/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-moscow-row-over-crimes-against-humanity-claims","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: shelling kills three in southern city of Berislav – as it happened ","bodyText":"We are now closing the blog. Here’s a summary of today’s events: Three people were killed by shelling near the southern Ukrainian city of Berislav on Sunday morning, according to local officials. The regional military administration said Russian forces struck the village of Burgunka with “massive artillery fire” and that one of the shells hit the yard of a family home. Ukrainian troops preparing for a Russian offensive in the eastern Donetsk region if the town of Bakhmut falls have described being outgunned and their fears of being “semi-encircled”. The state body that manages Ukraine’s nuclear power plants has said two missiles fired from the Black Sea on Saturday came “dangerously close” to hitting a plant in the Mykolaiv region. The US has said it believes China could be preparing to provide military aid to Russia, possibly including guns and other weapons. Russia has sustained almost 143,000 casualties since the beginning of the war, according to the latest figures from the Ukrainian military. The EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, has said the war could be over “in weeks” if the EU cannot increase its supply of ammunition to Ukraine. “We are in urgent war mode,” he said. “This shortage of ammunition has to be solved quickly.” France has said it would deliver the AMX-10 light armoured vehicles it has promised to Ukraine “by the end of next week”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also said in an interview that he wants Russia to lose the war but he does not want to see it “crushed”. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, will travel to Kyiv on Monday to meet with President Zelenskiy, according to reports. The amount of grain leaving Ukraine under a deal to keep food flowing to developing nations has dropped significantly in recent months, the body set up to monitor the shipments has said. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, rejected calls to supply Ukraine with cluster bombs, telling German media the military alliance “has neither recommended nor supplied these kinds of weapons.” The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said on Sunday he and President Joe Biden will discuss the possibility of increasing US troop presence in Poland and making it more permanent. The Biden administration is planning to impose new export controls and a fresh round of sanctions on Russia, targeting its defence and energy sectors, financial institutions and several individuals, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. The Ukraine war will have cost the German economy around €160bn (£142bn), or about 4% of its gross domestic output, in lost value creation by the end of the year, the head of the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) said. Russia said on Sunday that Ukraine was planning to stage a nuclear incident on its territory to pin the blame on Moscow before a United Nations meeting, without providing evidence for the accusation. Suggestions by senior Ukrainian government ministers that the country’s military should be provided with cluster munitions received a cool reception among western allies at the Munich security conference. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, rejected calls to supply Ukraine with cluster bombs, telling German media the military alliance “has neither recommended nor supplied these kinds of weapons”. Cluster munitions are a type of weapon that split open mid-air to release smaller explosives over a wide area. They can cause indiscriminate harm to civilians and have been banned under an international convention signed by more than 100 countries. On the sidelines of the conference, which concluded this afternoon, Ukraine’s calls for cluster munitions were widely discussed among attendees. For EU officials, however, the demand is particularly difficult since most European countries are parties to the convention. Asked at the conference about the calls for cluster munitions, Germany’s foreign affairs minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the country’s military support for Ukraine would be guided by the treaty. Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that within the German government “it is considered impossible that chancellor Olaf Scholz could allow something like this”. The reaction follows comments made by Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Olexander Kubrakov, who suggested Ukraine should be allowed to use cluster munitions on its territory. When asked about this on Saturday, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told reporters: “We understand that cluster ammunition is a debatable issue in world affairs. We are not party to the convention on the prohibition of cluster munitions. So legally there are no obstacles for that.” “If we receive one, we will be using it exclusively against military forces of the Russian Federation,” he added. Ukraine, like Russia and the US, has not joined the international convention on cluster munitions, which came into effect in 2010. The UN treaty prohibits under any circumstance the use, stockpiling, production or transfer of the weapons. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said on Sunday he and President Joe Biden will discuss the possibility of increasing US troop presence in Poland and making it more permanent. Biden will visit Poland over 20-22 February to mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. Morawiecki told CBS’s Face the Nation: We are in the process of discussion with president Biden’s administration about making their (troop) presence more permanent and increasing them. I’m very grateful also for sending new Patriot systems and other very modern weapons and munitions because this is also to some extent a proxy for presence of soldiers, but of course, the two go in tandem.” The US has about 11,000 personnel on rotation in Poland, according to CBS. Biden said last June the US would set up a new permanent army headquarters in Poland in response to Russian threats. He will meet the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, and eastern European allies but has no plans to cross into Ukraine, according to the White House. The Biden administration is planning to impose new export controls and a fresh round of sanctions on Russia, targeting key industries, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. The new sanctions will target Russia’s defence and energy sectors, financial institutions and several individuals, the report added. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, warned on the final day of the Munich security conference: Zelenskiy and the Ukrainians have a lot of applause and not enough ammunition. That’s the paradox. They need to be less applauded and better supplied with arms.” The Ukraine war will have cost the German economy around €160bn euros (£142bn), or about 4% of its gross domestic output, in lost value creation by the end of the year, the head of the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) said. That means GDP per capita in Europe’s largest economy will be €2,000 lower than it would otherwise have been, DIHK chief Peter Adrian told the Rheinische Post, Reuters reports. German industry is set to pay about 40% more for energy in 2023 than in 2021, before the crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February last year, a study by Allianz Trade said last month. “The growth outlook for 2023 and 2024 is therefore also lower than in many other countries,” Adrian said, adding that was also the case last year. Russia said on Sunday that Ukraine was planning to stage a nuclear incident on its territory to pin the blame on Moscow before a United Nations meeting, without providing evidence for the accusation. Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement that radioactive substances had been transported to Ukraine from a European country and Kyiv was preparing a large-scale “provocation”. “The aim of the provocation is to accuse Russia’s army of allegedly carrying out indiscriminate strikes on hazardous radioactive facilities in Ukraine, leading to the leakage of radioactive substances and contamination of the area,” it said. Ukraine and its allies have dismissed such accusations as cynical attempts to spread disinformation and accused Moscow of planning incidents itself in an attempt to blame Ukraine, Reuters reports. If you’re just joining us, here’s a quick round-up of all the latest from the war in Ukraine. Three people were killed by shelling near the southern Ukrainian city of Berislav on Sunday morning, according to local officials. The regional military administration said Russian forces struck the village of Burgunka with “massive artillery fire” and that one of the shells hit the yard of a family home. Ukrainian troops preparing for a Russian offensive in the eastern Donestk region if the town of Bakhmut falls have described being outgunned and fears of being “semi-encircled”.

The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, will travel to Kyiv on Monday to meet with President Zelensky, according to reports. The amount of grain leaving Ukraine under a deal to keep food flowing to developing nations has dropped significantly in recent months, the body set up to monitor the shipments has said. The oil company Shell and energy trader Vitol have been accused of prolonging the war in Ukraine by exploiting a “loophole” in the EU sanctions regime to bring products derived from Russian oil into Europe through Turkey. Oleg Ustenko, the economic adviser to President Zelenskiy, has urged the energy companies to commit to a deadline to halt the trade of a “Russian-origin oil products” to reduce Vladimir Putin’s war coffers, the Guardian has revealed. The EU implemented a ban on importing seaborne Russian crude oil on 5 December – the same day as a G7 price cap on Russian seaborne exports – and the ban was extended on 5 February to refined products such as diesel and fuel oil. But analysis of data from commodity tracker Kpler by the non-profit group Global Witness found that Shell had imported more than 600,000 barrels of refined products into the Netherlands from Turkish refineries known to import Russian oil since 5 December. Read the full story here: Ukrainian troops in the small town of Siversk have said they are preparing to defend one of the possible targets of the next Russian offensive. Siversk is just 21 miles north of the city of Bakhmut - scene of fierce fighting in recent weeks - and on a direct road to another of the key towns in the Donetsk region, Sloviansk. If Bakhmut falls, it is expected Russian forces would try to use it as a stepping stone to target Sloviansk as well as Kramatorsk, both larger cities. Speaking to Reuters, one soldier, 30-year-old Stefan, said the Soviet-era artillery with which Ukrainian forces were defending Siversk was being outgunned. “We have one artillery attack from our side, and the Russians can do it five times more,” he said. “It’s very difficult for the guys who are standing, especially at the first line [of defence], they feel it too much.” The deputy Siversk battalion commander, who used the nom-de-guerre “Han”, said the capture of Bakhmut by the Russians would leave his forces “semi-encircled”. “On the left side we have the Siverskyi Donets river, and the enemy will advance from the right, and it is possible to cut us off if they reach the Bakhmut highway,” he said. While capturing Bakhmut would be strategically useful to the Russians, Ukraine and its Western allies have said it would be a largely Pyrrhic victory, given the time taken and losses sustained. Some final pictures here from the last day of the Munich security conference, where discussion among world leaders has been dominated by the war in Ukraine. France is to begin delivering the armoured vehicles it has promised to Ukraine, the defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, said on Sunday. The vehicles, of the AMX-10 type and sometimes described as “light tanks”, are used for armed reconnaissance and attacks on enemy tanks. Their combat weight is 20 tonnes, around a third of that of France’s Leclerc battle tanks. Speaking to Le Parisien newspaper’s Sunday edition, Lecornu said that training of Ukrainian crews on the AMX-10 was “nearly complete” the first vehicles would be sent “by the end of next week”. He declined to specify the number of vehicles in the first batch, saying he did not want to give Russia any “strategic information”. President Emmanuel Macron promised in early January that France would provide the AMX-10s after months of hesitation over fears of escalating the conflict. The war in Ukraine will be over unless the EU finds a way in weeks to speed up the provision of ammunition, the EU foreign affairs chief has warned. Speaking on the final day of the Munich security conference, Josep Borrell said a special meeting of EU defence ministers slated for 8-9 March would provide a chance for countries to offer ammunition from their existing stocks. He added that it was taking up to 10 months for European armies to order and receive a single bullet. “We are in urgent war mode,” he said. “This shortage of ammunition has to be solved quickly; it is a matter of weeks.” Read the full story here: The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, will travel to Kyiv on Monday to meet President Zelenskiy, Reuters reports, citing a political source. Meloni, who took office in October, had said she planned to visit Kyiv before the 24 February anniversary of Russia’s invasion. Meloni, who heads the rightwing Brothers of Italy party, has been strongly supportive of Ukraine since taking office in October, but there are frictions over the issue within the coalition government that she leads. The former PM Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia party, last week said he would not seek a meeting with Zelenskiy if he were still head of government because he blames him for the war. The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, another of Forza Italia’s founders, said on Saturday he had met his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, on the sidelines of a G7 meeting at the Munich security conference to reassure him of Italy’s support. Italy and France have also recently finalised talks over delivery of an advanced air defence system to Kyiv in the spring. Former champion boxer Wladimir Klitschko has urged Ukraine’s allies to maintain their support for its resistance to the Russian invasion. Klitschko is the brother of Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, and since the war began has made frequent public appearances to rally support for his country. Speaking at a panel event on the final day of the Munich security conference, he said Ukraine was “completely depending” on “all the allies of the free world” and that it was “important to understand how much joy we have to live in a democracy”. “We talk about democracy but we don’t know what it feels like, and it’s so great,” he said. “So please keep on supporting us in Ukraine, because we are you. And you are us. It doesn’t matter what is in front of us - one of the strongest armies in the world, or weapons – our will is indestructible.” Gesturing to the people in the hall, he added: “Because it’s our will, of us, the free world.” The US has said it believes China may be about to provide lethal aid to help Russia in the war in Ukraine, prompting a direct warning against doing so from the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to China’s top diplomat. Blinken made the warning to the Chinese state councillor Wang Yi on Saturday evening at a blunt meeting on the sidelines of the Munich security conference. He also urged China to stop helping Russia evade the impact of sanctions. China’s trade with Russia is increasing and it has been buying Russian oil, but probably below the US$60 per barrel price cap imposed by the EU and G7 group of states. Speaking to CBS’s Face the Nation after he met with Wang, Blinken said: “We’ve made very clear to them that [providing lethal support] could cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship.” Read the full story here: Two Russian missiles fired on Saturday flew “dangerously close” to a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, the state body that runs the site has said. Energoatom, which manages the country’s nuclear plants, said that at 8.25 and 8.27am local time, two cruise missiles were recorded flying past the South Ukraine nuclear power plant. The plant sits in the Mykolaiv region around 80 miles north of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. Early on Saturday, Ukrainian military officials said that four Kalibr missiles had been launched from the Black Sea and that two had been intercepted by air defence systems. “The threat of hitting the reactor with possible consequences – a nuclear disaster – was again high,” Energoatom said. “This is another act of nuclear terrorism of the Russian Federation, which threatens the security of the whole world!” The body also appealed to the International Atomic Energy Authority to take “all possible measures to stop Russian nuclear terrorism” and to establish “a no-fly zone over all nuclear facilities of Ukraine”. Three people were killed by Russian shelling near the southern Ukrainian city of Berislav on Sunday morning, according to local officials. Posting on Telegram, the military administration in the Kherson region said Russian forces struck the village of Burgunka with “massive artillery fire”. It said one of the shells hit the yard of a family home and that at least three people – a father, mother and uncle – had been killed. It added that five people – a grandmother, a man, a 13-year-old boy, a 10-year-old girl, and an eight-year-old boy – were wounded. All the injured are said to have been taken to a medical facility and to be receiving treatment. “The enemy is targeting peaceful people!” the post said. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began a year ago this week, was an extraordinary and unexpected event that has changed the world in which we live. Long-held assumptions about peace in Europe, post-cold war relations with Moscow and Nato’s diminished standing were shattered overnight. The war has revolutionised German defence policy, silenced French talk of “strategic autonomy”, boosted EU unity, revived US commitment to the transatlantic alliance, dramatised the global north-south divide, reduced the UN to the role of hand-wringing bystander and given the UK an opportunity, after Brexit, to show it still has an international role to play. The fact the sovereign, democratic nation of Ukraine has survived, unbowed and unconquered, is possibly the most remarkable outcome of the conflict so far. And Ukraine’s physical survival, despite significant losses of territory, has been matched by psychological triumph. For this, much credit goes to its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has campaigned tirelessly to whip up international support. Gifts of weapons, cash aid, technology, expertise and shelter have poured in, along with volunteers, military and civilian. In contrast, morale among Russia’s army and public has slumped. But, and it’s a big “but”, it is plain the war is far from over and may be entering an even more dangerous phase. Read the Observer view on the war in Ukraine in full here: Russia is probably using balloons to gather information about Ukraine’s defence systems and force it to use up ammunition, according to UK intelligence. In its latest update, the Ministry of Defence said that, on 12 February, Ukraine’s air force reported sighting a number of balloons near the eastern city of Dnipro. Ukrainian armed forces also said that, on 15 February, they spotted and shot down several balloons over the capital, Kyiv. They also said the balloons had radar reflectors – devices that help radar systems detect small objects – suspended beneath them. “It is likely that the balloons were Russian,” the UK update said. “They likely represent a new tactic by Russia to gain information about Ukrainian air defence systems and compel the Ukrainians to expend valuable stocks of surface to air missiles and ammunition.” The amount of grain leaving Ukraine under a deal to keep food flowing to developing nations has dropped significantly, according to the body set up to monitor the shipments. The Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul, which comprises inspectors from the UN, Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey, said food exports from three Ukrainian ports have fallen from 3.7m metric tons in December to 3 million in January. It added that the number of average daily inspections fell to 5.7 last month, down from a peak of 10.6 in October. The drop in supply equates to about a month of food consumption for Kenya and Somalia combined. The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of deliberately delaying inspections of vessels to take “advantage of the opportunity of uninterrupted trade shipping” from its own ports on the Black Sea, a claim Moscow has dismissed as “simply not true”. One of the deals negotiated last summer to keep food supplies moving from ports in Ukraine is due to come up for renewal next month. Russia has sustained almost 143,000 casualties since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian military. The latest update from Ukraine’s ministry of defence said the number of casualties on the Russian side had reached 142,860, up by 590 since yesterday. It also said that 3,310 tanks and 6,545 armoured combat vehicles had been destroyed, increases of seven and 12 respectively. Tweeting the figures, the ministry included a quote from the Beatles’ 1968 song Back in the USSR: “Let me hear your balalaikas [a Russian instrument] ringing out.” President Zelensky has welcomed indications he has received in the last few days that attempts will be made to hold Russia legally accountable for crimes committed in Ukraine. Speaking in his nightly address, he said he had received “strong signals from our partners, and concrete agreements regarding the inevitability of holding Russia accountable for aggression, for terror against Ukraine and its people”. “Every Russian attack on … every corner of our state will have concrete legal consequences for the terrorist state. We have to restore justice,” he said. On Friday, it was announced that a body called the Register of Damages Caused by Russian Aggression to Ukraine will be set up in The Hague to keep a record of the damage to Ukrainian households, businesses, and infrastructure caused by the war. Addressing the Munich security conference on Saturday, the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, also said the US had formally determined that Russia had committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine. In his own speech, the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said that “we must see justice through the [international criminal court]” and “consider together how to ensure that Russia pays” towards the reconstruction of Ukraine. The US government has had conversations with Elon Musk about the use of Starlink satellite internet in Ukraine, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said. SpaceX this month said it had taken steps to prevent Ukraine’s military from using the company’s Starlink service to control drones, saying it was “never never meant to be weaponized”. In an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press with Chuck Todd, due to air on Sunday, Blinken was questioned about whether the US had asked Musk, who serves as Starlink’s chief executive, to remove the restrictions. “Well, I can’t share any conversations we’ve had other than to say we’ve had conversations,” he said. SpaceX has privately shipped truckloads of Starlink terminals to Ukraine, allowing its military to communicate by plugging them in and connecting them with the nearly 4,000 satellites SpaceX has so far launched into low-Earth orbit. Russia has attempted to jam Starlink signals in the region, though SpaceX countered by hardening the service’s software, Musk has said. France wants Russia to be defeated in Ukraine but it does not want to “crush” it, president Emmanuel Macron has told paper Le Journal du Dimanche. “I do not think, as some people do, that we must aim for a total defeat of Russia, attacking Russia on its own soil,” Macron said in an interview published on Saturday. “Those observers want to, above all else, crush Russia. That has never been the position of France and it will never be our position.” Macron has drawn criticism from some Nato allies for delivering mixed messages regarding his policy on the war between Ukraine and Russia, with some considering Paris a weak link in the western alliance. On Friday, Macron urged allies to step up military support for Ukraine. The US believes China may be about to provide lethal aid to help Russia in the war in Ukraine prompting a direct warning from the US secretary of state Antony Blinken to China’s top diplomat not to take the step. Blinken made the warning to the Chinese state councillor Wang Yi on Saturday evening at a meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference during which he also rebuked China over the use of an alleged spy balloon over US soil. In a blunt meeting he also urged China to stop helping Russia evade the impact of sanctions. China’s trade with Russia is increasing and it has been purchasing Russian oil, but probably below the $60 per barrel price cap imposed by the EU and G7 group of states. Blinken told US networks that the US had information China was considering whether to give Russia assistance, possibly including guns and weapons, for the Ukraine war. He made clear to Wang that “would have serious consequences in our relationship”. “There are various kinds of lethal assistance that they are at least contemplating providing, to include weapons,” Blinken said, adding that Washington would soon release more details. Wang told Blinken the United States must “face up to and resolve the damage” to bilateral relations “caused by the indiscriminate use of force”, according to a brief statement on Sunday by China’s foreign affairs ministry. Russia’s ambassador to the US on Sunday responded to the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, who accused Russia of crimes against humanity during its nearly year-long invasion of Ukraine. Harris made the comments a day earlier at the Munich security conference where, five days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion, western leaders are assessing Europe’s worst conflict since the second world war. “We regard such insinuations as an unprecedented attempt to demonise Russia in the framework of the hybrid war unleashed against us,” Anatoly Antonov said on the Russian embassy’s Telegram account. “There is no doubt that the purpose of such attacks by Washington is to justify its own actions to fuel the Ukrainian crisis.” The UN-backed Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says it has identified war crimes but has not concluded whether they amount to crimes against humanity. Organisations supported by the US Agency for International Development have documented more than 30,000 war crimes incidents since the invasion, according to the US government. Ukrainian officials said they were investigating the Thursday shelling of the city of Bakhmut as a possible war crime. Hello, this is Christine Kearney bringing you the latest developments in the Russia-Ukraine war. Moscow has responded to Joe Biden’s presidential administration announcing, at the Munich security conference, the US’s formal conclusion that Russia has committed crimes against humanity during its nearly year-long war against Ukraine. The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said: “In the case of Russia’s actions in Ukraine … there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity.” Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the US, responded on Sunday: “There is no doubt that the purpose of such attacks by Washington is to justify its own actions to fuel the Ukrainian crisis.” About 40 heads of state and government as well as politicians and security experts from nearly 100 countries – including the US, Europe and China – are attending the three-day conference to discuss Europe’s security situation amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. In other developments at 9am in Kyiv and 10am in Moscow: China’s senior diplomat Wang Yi, one of the few external politicians able to influence Russia, announced that China would launch its peace initiative on the anniversary of the war, and has been consulting Germany, Italy and France on its proposals. China had “neither stood by idly nor thrown fuel on the fire” regarding the crisis in Ukraine, he said. Western leaders have reacted nervously to the Chinese peace plan for Ukraine due to be revealed this week, but cautiously welcomed the move as a first sign that China recognises the war cannot be regarded solely as a European affair. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned Wang Yi of consequences should China provide material support to Russia’s invasion, saying in an interview after the two met that Washington was concerned Beijing was considering supplying weapons to Moscow. The top diplomats met at an undisclosed location on the sidelines of the Munich conference. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, called on the west to “double down” on its military support to Ukraine. “When Putin started this war, he gambled that our resolve would falter,” he said. “But we proved him wrong then, and we will prove him wrong now.” He also offered to help other countries that were willing to send aircraft to Ukraine now. The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said there was “no doubt” that Russia had committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine. Harris also warned that any Chinese support for Russia in its war in Ukraine would reward aggression. Ukraine must win its battle against Russia’s invasion, said Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, warning that a Russian victory might embolden Moscow to attack other countries. Pistorius said he assured the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Germany and its allies would help Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the EU wants to work with the defence industry to quicken and scale up the production of ammunition, both for the Ukrainian military and to replenish stocks at home. It follows warnings from Kyiv that its forces need more supplies quickly. Poland is ready to support Ukraine with its MiG jets, but only if a broader coalition is formed with the United States as a leader, said the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has said it is becoming “increasingly difficult” for the Russian government to “insulate the population” from the reality of the war. Air raid alerts were in place across much of western and southern Ukraine early on Saturday, with Ukrainian officials reporting that Russia fired four Kalibr missiles from the Black Sea. Two people were injured in a strike on the western city of Khmelnytskyi, according to the local mayor. One civilian was reported killed in shelling in the eastern city of Vovchansk, a few miles from the Russian border. Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday that its forces had captured Hrianykivka, a village in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region that is well to the north of most significant fighting. A briefing note from Ukraine’s general staff later on Saturday said the village was being shelled, but made no mention of an assault. The number of Russian soldiers killed since the invasion has reached 142,270, according to the Ukrainian military. A day earlier the UK’s defence ministry said as many as 60,000 Russian forces may have been killed in just under a year. The MoD said the casualty rate “has significantly increased since September 2022 when ‘partial mobilisation’ was imposed”. Most of Ukraine has power despite a series of major Russian attacks on the generating system, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday, praising the work done by repair crews. Russia has carried out repeated waves of attacks on key infrastructure, at times leaving millions of people without light, heating or running water."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2021/may/07/doom-by-niall-ferguson-review-how-to-make-sense-of-catastrophe","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-07T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"Doom by Niall Ferguson review – how to make sense of catastrophe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/may/07/doom-by-niall-ferguson-review-how-to-make-sense-of-catastrophe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2021/may/07/doom-by-niall-ferguson-review-how-to-make-sense-of-catastrophe","fields":{"headline":"Doom by Niall Ferguson review – how to make sense of catastrophe","bodyText":"The bad news is that plagues are a constant companion to human civilisation. The good news is that we are getting better at explaining their causes and treating them without recourse to superstition. When the Black Death ravaged Europe in the 14th century, troupes of flagellants proceeded from town to town, surrounding local churches, beating themselves with spiky, iron-tipped leather scourges. They saw the disease as divine punishment and prayed fervently for release from its clutches, all the while aiding its dispersal across the land. The medical treatments they needed were nearly 600 years away. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought its share of irrational fanaticism. There is something medieval about paranoid mobs felling mobile phone masts in the belief that 5G signals are responsible for the disease. But that minor skirmish is far from the frontline in a battle that science is winning, at least until the next disaster strikes. The march of progress gives cause for optimism; the certain recurrence of disaster less so. That tension is the subject of Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe, Niall Ferguson’s excursion into the history of horrible afflictions. It is not a gloomy book, although it dwells often on our collective failure to learn from past mistakes. Ferguson’s interest is the patterns and systems that emerge from the repetition, to which end he skips quite breezily through a rich catalogue of gruesome, miserable experiences: floods, earthquakes that swallow whole cities, volcanic eruptions that bring humans to the brink of extinction, wars, famines and an array of lower-division horrors. The sinking of the Titanic and nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl exhibit at microcosmic level much the same “fractal geometry of disaster” discernible in the macro calamities. Ferguson’s rundown of disasters combines the man-made and natural kinds, exploring the boundary between the two. Sometimes it is distinct. The Romans did not provoke Vesuvius, whereas the Germans did invade Belgium in 1914. But in many cases, humanity is the accomplice to mass suffering from what looks ostensibly like natural causes, as when the Spanish flu ripped through barracks and trenches towards the end of the first world war. The virus racked up a much higher body count than bullets and artillery. Likewise, terrible politics can manufacture calamity out of nature, as when Stalin’s collectivisation policy led to famine in Ukraine and sustained it with repression. There are few cases where responsibility can be attributed so directly. There is usually too much chaos and complexity for any individual to have agency over the sweep of events. With some caveats, Ferguson endorses the view expressed by Tolstoy in War and Peace, that Napoleon was the slave of historical forces beyond his comprehension, not their master. Leaders can be morally accountable for calamitous errors of judgment and, as with Hitler and the Third Reich, epoch-defining atrocities. But culpability is not all of causation. The origin of most catastrophes is elusive. There are too many threads going back too far, but also apparently stable situations can spiral abruptly out of control. It can take centuries for empires to decline, as happened with Rome, but they can also unravel overnight. The USSR passed from superpower status to non-existence in a matter of months. If there are no patterns discernible with hindsight, the individual living through some traumatic event has practically zero chance of making sense of it in real time. Mercifully, the human spirit is primed to get on with life in almost any circumstances. Sometimes, the best available explanation is expressed in a formula that Ferguson traces back to a San Francisco gang member cited in a master’s dissertation from 1964: “Shit happens.” Ferguson would hardly be fulfilling his remit as a historian if he stopped there. He does identify recurrent traits from the vast back catalogue of misfortune. When it comes to finding fault, he is particularly exercised by bureaucratic failure, which he finds in cases of industrial accident and, most recently, in British and American responses to Covid-19. There is no disputing the harm that can be done by institutional inertia, group-think and mediocre middle managers pursuing perverse incentives (or just trying to shirk difficult choices). The Challenger space shuttle disaster makes a good case study. Pressure to meet a launch target overrode known concerns about a design flaw that proved fatal. But when it comes to the pandemic, Ferguson starts to reveal his conservative aversion to big states. He is not exactly forgiving of Donald Trump (“manifestly idiotic” is the verdict on one episode of maladministration), but the former president is treated more as a pathetic accessory to the disaster than a motor of it. In the UK context, Boris Johnson’s equivocations and delays are leapfrogged in eagerness to find fault with scientists and officials advising the prime minister. Notably absent, too, is recognition of the fiscal background to Britain’s pandemic – the possibility that Covid wreaked more harm because the public realm had been depleted by decades of budget cuts. Ferguson’s speciality is financial history, so he surely has a position on that point, but we don’t know what it is. There are other flashes of political partisanship that feel out of place in a historical account. The death toll in care homes is cast, gnomically, as “a paradoxical result of fetishising the National Health Service at the expense of institutions beyond its aegis”. Ferguson is sceptical of lockdowns on the basis of their economic impact, embracing the familiar fallacy that government suffocated livelihoods in exchange for an insufficient dividend in lives saved. In reality, failure to lock down would have drastically increased the economic harm by prolonging the whole ordeal. But on this, too, there is an ideological tell in Ferguson’s description of Covid regulation as “varying degrees of house arrest” – a formula that conflates necessary public health measures and authoritarian spite. By the author’s admission, the pandemic section of the book is unfinished and vulnerable to refutation by post-publication events. But by that stage in the narrative there is already a sense the book has drifted from its original purpose. What began as a taxonomy of doom evolves into a hawkish foreign policy treatise on the coming cold war with China. It is a bracing polemical finale that seems to round off a different book to the one that started in philosophical meditation over death as life’s unshakable shadow. Perhaps a more satisfying conclusion was simply unavailable. Doom covers an impressive sweep of history at a lively narrative clip and weaves a lot of disparate strands together into an engaging picture, even if they cannot, in the end, be arranged into a meaningful pattern. While it would have been a tidier volume if all of mankind’s historic woes had been drawn into a coherent model, with predictability and rules, it is to Ferguson’s credit as a historian that he accepts the futility of that endeavour. He is wise, in the end, not to posit a grand theory of catastrophe, when his exploration of the subject proves the absence of any such thing. • Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe by Niall Ferguson is published by Allen Lane (£25).

Or is it just more hot air?","bodyText":"Is Australia’s multibillion dollar gas industry going to help the region and the world decarbonise, as its supporters and the industry claims? Neat soundbites that gas is less dirty than coal, or factoids suggesting liquefied natural gas exports are pushing out those of more polluting coal, are plentiful and slip easily from the tongue, but are almost always bereft of detail. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, was asked last week about the future of one mega-project already approved in his state – Woodside’s $12bn Scarborough LNG development. On climate change, McGowan said opposing gas sets up a “conundrum” and that “if we don’t provide gas, well, other countries put in more coal”. He told reporters that burning coal generated “two or three times the emissions” of gas. The new resources minister, Madeleine King, in comments reported in The West Australian on Thursday, said countries such as Japan, Korea and China were “demanding our gas for their path to net zero” and LNG projects would help countries “reduce their reliance on other fossil fuels that are higher carbon emitters”. “Australia’s gas industry is part of a decarbonising world – and it’s urgent,” she said. There are two huge problems with this, and both should be good reasons for politicians and commentators to hold back with their LNG truisms. One is the array of questions you need to answer before you can compare the climate impacts of gas to coal, not only in terms of emissions but also the effect that supplying LNG has on the uptake of renewable energy. Another is that although claims of LNG being significantly less dirty than coal have been made for more than a decade, there is practically no evidence to back this up. There is, however, plenty of analysis showing LNG is only marginally less bad for the climate than coal – some commissioned by the gas industry itself. Dimitri Lafleur is a carbon analyst at Global Carbon Insights, a research group funded by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility. He says statements like those made by McGowan are always “incomplete”. “Purely on a unit of energy basis, the combustion of gas is 60% of coal emissions. But then you have to look at the quality of the gas, the quality of the coal,” he says, noting you also have to consider what the gas is being used for. Calculations often ignore the impact of fugitive emissions – the loss of the potent greenhouse gas methane that can leak anywhere along the LNG supply chain – or the emissions from the vast amounts of energy used to liquefy the gas and then regasify the product it at its final destination (the biggest consumer of Australian gas is actually the country’s own LNG industry). “You need to have all of that in your calculations. It’s misleading to always come back to this idea that gas is only 60% or 50% of the emissions of coal,” Lafleur says. Temperature Check asked McGowan’s office for the basis of his statement that other countries would revert to coal if they were not sold gas, or that gas was less dirty. The questions were not answered, but a statement said: “The Premier reiterates his support of gas as a transition fuel noting there is strong demand from trading partners looking for lower-emissions energy sources.” In 2019, Woodside actually commissioned CSIRO to “test the assumption through modelling scenarios that an increase in LNG in Asia will lead to a reduction in GHG emissions and support deployment of renewable electricity generation”. What was the conclusion? Unsurprisingly, the answer was nuanced, as it should be, but it contrasted with the simplistic claims often made about LNG. “Gas can assist [greenhouse gas] emissions mitigation during the period when carbon prices or equivalent signals are strong enough to force high renewable electricity generation shares,” it said. “Until the carbon price reaches that strength, increased gas supply’s impact on emissions reduction is either negative or neutral. “Also, after renewables have reached a high share, additional gas supply has nothing further to contribute to emission reduction.” Australia’s two biggest LNG customers, according to the Office of the Chief Economist, are China and Japan. Analysis carried out a decade ago by engineering firm WorleyParsons (now known as Worley) looked at the emissions of Australian LNG if it was exported to China and burned in power stations. The least dirty LNG produced from conventional wells burned in the most efficient gas plants generated 0.65 tonnes of CO2 per megawatt hour. LNG from coal seams (the basis for Queensland’s LNG export industry) was dirtier, at 0.73 tonnes per megawatt hour. This is compared to black coal, which generated 0.78 tonnes per megawatt hour in the most efficient power stations and 1.03 tonnes in the dirtiest. But crucially the WorleyParsons study noted that when LNG was exported for electricity its greenhouse gas profile was at least 22 times dirtier than wind and 13 times dirtier than nuclear power. Climate class action The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has promised an “end to the climate wars”. But the newly endorsed opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has signalled he wants to extend this particular cultural battleground to children’s classrooms. The Sky News host and News Corp commentator Andrew Bolt told Dutton this week that kids were crying with fear over the climate crisis, even though dams were filling, crops were getting bigger and they had “never been less likely to die in a climate catastrophe”. “Are you going to be the voice that says, look at the science, it’s not the climate crisis a lot of people are saying,” Bolt asked, not mentioning the unprecedented bushfires, floods, sea level rises or the basic physics of the greenhouse effect. Dutton said: “If it was limited to just environmental issues or climate change then it would be bad enough. “The extremism of some of the teachers and the language that they use and the approach that they take … But it’s across a broad range of public policy areas.” Dutton said he wanted to “shine a light” on the issue and teachers should be able to “stick to the facts”, claiming “many teachers out there are incredibly frustrated by what’s taking place”. Prof Amy Cutter-Mackenzie, the dean of Southern Cross University’s faculty of education and an expert in environmental education, says Dutton’s words don’t ring true. “That is not a perspective I am hearing. In fact, I have not heard that from anyone in the educational community,” she tells Temperature Check. “Children are so far beyond whether climate change is human induced or not. “The suggestion teachers are scaremongering with the curriculum is utterly false. It’s not about scaremongering. It’s about understanding the world.” Going nuclear In the Australian newspaper, commentator Claire Lehmann was out advocating for “small modular nuclear reactors”. This sounds neat and tidy but the phrase covers a vast array of theoretical approaches and designs to build small nuclear power plants. The World Nuclear Association lists only five small reactors currently operating. In her advocacy, Lehmann claimed that while many environmentalists were opposed to nuclear power, they ignored that solar panels could “leak toxic heavy metals” and that wind turbines were responsible for “killing large numbers” of native birds. The number of birds that die from flying into windows, or being eaten by cats, dwarfs the small number that die when they fly into turbine blades. But Lehmann’s complaints about the potential for solar panels to leak while advocating for nuclear energy was unfortunately timed. She wasn’t to know that just days later a study would appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggesting that any future development and deployment of small modular reactors would “increase the volume of nuclear waste in need of management and disposal by factors of 2 to 30”, depending on the design."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/19/uk-net-zero-report-recommendations-and-conclusions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T15:00:12Z","webTitle":"UK net zero report: what are its recommendations and conclusions?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/19/uk-net-zero-report-recommendations-and-conclusions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/19/uk-net-zero-report-recommendations-and-conclusions","fields":{"headline":"UK net zero report: what are its recommendations and conclusions?","bodyText":"What was in the net zero review? Chris Skidmore, the head of the government’s net zero review, said he aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the UK’s net zero ambitions. The 323-page net zero review covers the whole of the UK’s economy, as well as the impacts on individuals and communities. Everything from the funding for net zero schemes to the need for regulation, parliamentary scrutiny, data, and research and development is examined, along with sectors of the economy from energy and transport to housing and farming. There are 130 recommendations, ranging from the highly specific, such as bringing forward the end of routine flaring by oil and gas companies from 2030 to 2025, to vaguer hopes, such as central and local government working more closely together. Some of the main recommendations cover: Energy The government should consider replacing the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas with a net zero fund that ringfences the proceeds for investment in offshore wind and other low-CO2 projects. Nuclear power should have a clear strategy, and the government must “double down on achieving the UK’s nuclear baseload requirement”, including small modular reactors and “a fleet of projects”, though the review does not specify how many new power stations should be built. Hydrogen should have a 10-year delivery plan, set out by the end of this year, that will require decisions on funding and technology, including hydrogen for home heating. Ministers should also “consider” requiring fossil fuel producers to “take back” the CO2 produced from burning their fuels, by storing 10% of it underground, using carbon capture and storage technology. Ofgem’s remit should be expanded to include the net zero target. Homes The boiler upgrade scheme should be extended, and people given incentives to buy heat pumps. Skidmore publicly called for “a rooftop revolution”, though some of the recommendations are slightly weaker – for instance, that there should be a consultation on whether new homes should be fitted with solar panels, and a supply chain built up for renewables. Farming Environmental land management schemes, the replacement for the EU farm subsidy system, should be laid out in detail this year, the review recommends, which will come as a relief to farmers concerned about the vagueness of current government plans. Nature-based solutions, which help to increase the UK’s carbon sinks, should also be encouraged. The review also calls for a biomass strategy, without setting out what should be in it. Research and development By this autumn, the government should set out how to create incentives for research and development into new low-CO2 technologies. Three new demonstrator projects should be established. Finance The UK could become “the most competitive financial centre” for raising capital for the green transition, so the government should review opportunities for the banking sector and how to encourage investment. There should also be clear rules on how companies should report their climate impacts. What was missing? Onshore wind and solar farms The review suggests taskforces should be set up for the deployment of onshore wind and solar power, rather than calling for clear targets on onshore windfarms and solar farms in England. These have been controversial questions, as some Tory MPs are opposed to onshore windfarms – despite widespread public support for them – and solar farms. Insulation and home heating Although home heating accounts for 14% of the UK’s emissions, and is one of the biggest cost-of-living concerns amid soaring gas prices, the review stops well short of recommending the sort of nationwide house-by-house programme of upgrades that campaigners have been calling for, or setting out clear options on how to encourage homeowners to upgrade their energy efficiency. No new gas boilers should be installed from 2033, the review said, but that is just two years earlier than the government’s current target of 2035. Those hoping for a clear endorsement of hydrogen for home heating, however – which some hydrogen companies and Tory MPs want but which economists and energy experts say is uneconomic and physically unviable – will also have been disappointed. While not ruling out hydrogen for home heating, the review is notably lukewarm: by the end of this year, the government should update its analysis of hydrogen for home heating “to ensure that the case for economic optimality and feasibility still holds”. Behaviour change To meet the UK’s net zero targets, people will have to change their behaviour, from driving less to eating less meat. These changes should be healthier and better for most of us, but they will require some effort. There are recommendations on eco-labelling and a CO2 calculator for consumers, but beyond that, the review has nothing to say on how consumer behaviour should change, or how the government should encourage behaviour change. Transport Emissions from transport have scarcely budged in a decade, and it is now the biggest single contributor to the UK’s carbon footprint. Yet the review gives a scant five recommendations on the issue, two of which are for shipping and aviation. Public transport merits not a single recommendation, reflecting the absence of government strategy on the subject. On electric vehicles, the report recommends equalising VAT on public and private electric vehicle chargings – useful, perhaps, but not likely to have any significant impact. Meanwhile, why is there is no mention of the rollout of a nationwide system of charging points experts say is needed? Verdict What seeks to be a comprehensive review actually contains huge gaps, reflecting the Tory party’s seeming paralysis over basic issues that need to be grasped, from finding a way to finance the insulation British housing desperately needs, to building out onshore wind, and the absence of any real plan for transport or behaviour change. As a basis for action, this report passes too many bucks to be truly effective – but as an assessment of the government’s failures by a party loyalist, it is devastating."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/26/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-276-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-26T01:58:15Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 276 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/26/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-276-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/26/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-276-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 276 of the invasion","bodyText":"More than 6m households in Ukraine are still affected by power cuts, two days after targeted Russian strikes on the country’s energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. “As of this evening, blackouts continue in most regions [of Ukraine] and in Kyiv. In total, more than 6 million subscribers,” Zelensky said in his nightly address on Friday. The number of affected households had reduced “by half” since Wednesday. He said about 600,000 people were experiencing power cuts in Kyiv, the capital, with the Odessa, Lviv, Vinnytsia and Dnipropetrovsk regions also among the worst affected as temperatures approach freezing. The European Union will step up efforts to provide Ukraine with support to restore and maintain power and heating, the head of the European Commission said on Friday. Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement after a phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the EU executive arm was preparing the delivery to Ukraine large donations from EU countries and from the EC’s reserves. Russian shelling on the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson killed 15 civilians on Friday, officials said, as engineers across the country sought to restore heat, water and power to major cities. Several “private houses and high-rise buildings” had been damaged, city official Galyna Lugova also said. The shelling of Kherson, a key eastern city recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces, was the deadliest Russian bombardment in recent days. Yarovslav Yanushovich, head of the Kherson military administration, said Russian forces “opened fire on a residential area with multiple rocket launchers”. Hungary’s President Katalin Novak is travelling to Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy, her Ukrainian counterpart, the website index.hu reported on Friday, adding that Novak would go by train via Poland. The Hungarian president’s office said it would neither deny nor confirm the information. Novak, a close ally of the nationalist prime minister Viktor Orban, would be the highest-ranking Hungarian politician to visit Zelenskiy since Russia’s invasion in February. Ukraine’s leaders would have to be “far-sighted” to secure peace, Pope Francis said, suggesting Kyiv would have to make concessions to end the war with Russia. In an open letter released on Friday to mark the war’s nine-month anniversary, the pontiff praised the strength of Ukrainians in the face of the onslaught. “The world has recognised a bold and strong people, a people that suffers and prays, cries and struggles, resists and hopes: a noble and martyred people.” Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants have been reconnected to the national power grid after completely losing off-site power earlier this week, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. The facilities were all disconnected from the grid on Wednesday for the first time in Ukrainian history after the latest wave of Russian air strikes on vital infrastructure. In a statement on Friday, the nuclear watchdog said Ukraine had informed it on Friday that its Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyy plants had been reconnected. Ukraine reconnected its vast Zaporizhzhia plant on Thursday, Kyiv said earlier. Armenia has asked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to chair peace talks with Azerbaijan in a fresh challenge to Vladimir Putin’s increasingly loose grip on Russia’s regional allies in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The snub from a traditional ally to Putin comes immediately on the back of his disastrous summit with six former Soviet states. EU diplomats were meeting on Friday night in an effort to reach a deal on a price level at which to cap Russian oil exports, according to a report by Bloomberg. European governments have failed so far to find an agreement ahead of a 5 December deadline. A G7 proposal for a cap of $65-$70 a barrel is seen as far too high by some, and too low by others. Angela Merkel has insisted that her position as a lame duck in the last months of her time in office made it more or less impossible for her to influence the behaviour of Vladimir Putin. The former German chancellor appeared defensive and quietly defiant about her inability to change the course of the Russian president’s decision-making in the run-up to the invasion of Ukraine, telling German news magazine Spiegel she felt acutely aware that her ability to negotiate with Putin was minimal because it was known she would not stand for a fifth term. The head of the Russian mercenary outfit Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has claimed a former US Marine general is working for the group. In response to a request for comment from Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, Prigozhin said on Friday: “There are not very many Finnish citizens in the Wagner PMC, about 20 people … They are fighting in a British battalion [as part of Wagner PMC] which is commanded by a US citizen, a former general of the Marine Corps,” Prigozhin said, as quoted by the press service of his company Concord.

Although a communist and long-time member of CND, he worked on many sensitive international nuclear power projects. He was also an expert in soil science, an academic and a bon vivant. Born in Bolton, Lancashire, to Sydney Skipp, a pattern maker, and his wife, Hilda, Bryan attended Bolton boys’ school. His parents, both Methodists, wanted him to go into the ministry but he soon declared himself an atheist. Instead of doing national service, Bryan spent several years as a miner in Cannock, Staffordshire, and then studied mining engineering at the University of Birmingham, graduating in 1953. It was an influential time in his life. While at Birmingham, George Derwent Thomson, then a professor there, mentored Bryan into communism. After graduating he went to Paris, where he gained a PhD from the Ecole des Mines. He became a fellow of the Geological Society in 1956, aged 26. Following his PhD, Bryan started a lifetime job at the engineering consultancy Soil Mechanics, part of the Mowlem organisation. He became an international authority on soil science, but was also involved in civil engineering projects, such as power station demolitions. He published more than 70 papers in academic journals and was a visiting lecturer and examiner at Imperial College London, for more than 30 years. In the 1960s Bryan married and divorced. A child of his marriage, Gerrard, died of misadventure aged 14. In 1970 he met my mother, Maria Tsaneva, at an engineering conference in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. They married in 1972 and we all moved to London. I was 15 at the time. Bryan made sure we adapted to the British way of life – Indian cooking, Royal Society of Arts debates, noisy street politics and sailing in his boat, Cyranka. We all became involved with the British-Bulgarian Society and Bryan was a dedicated member. Though lavish and frequent entertainers, Bryan and Maria never had a car and we lived in a small flat in Brixton. He also threw himself into south London life, volunteering at the Angell Road adventure playground, the Gresham Centre youth club and for Lambeth Council for Community Relations. His career flourished while his communist principles never faltered. On occasion, when Bryan was the only person for a job with the relevant skills and expertise, he would loudly proclaim his politics lest someone later point an accusing finger at him for gathering secrets while being a communist and a CND-er. Thus he worked on nuclear power station sitings, nuclear submarine berths and nuclear waste disposal. Bryan retired at the close of 1994 but went on to work as consultant for 15 years. In the late 1990s he was among an international multidisciplinary delegation that surveyed the crumbling original Chernobyl power station “sarcophagus” and advised on the construction of a new protective shell. In the early 2000s he was involved in helping to devise an international standard on earthquake-resistant structures, under the aegis of the British Standards Institution. Maria died in 2015. He is survived by me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/mar/09/johnson-turns-truth-on-head-over-uk-response-to-ukraine-refugee-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-09T15:57:43Z","webTitle":"Johnson turns truth on head in lines about UK response to Ukraine refugee crisis | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/09/johnson-turns-truth-on-head-over-uk-response-to-ukraine-refugee-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/mar/09/johnson-turns-truth-on-head-over-uk-response-to-ukraine-refugee-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Johnson turns truth on head over UK response to Ukraine refugee crisis","bodyText":"Since 2015, Boris Johnson told an antsy House of Commons at prime minster’s questions, “We’ve done more to resettle vulnerable people than any other European country”. It didn’t make sense, so perhaps it was a mistake. Poland has taken 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees, Hungary has taken 190,000, Germany 50,000. By Tuesday, we’d taken 300. Maybe he didn’t mean Ukrainians, because he hadn’t refreshed his browser? Maybe he meant Syrians, 621,000 of whom were given sanctuary by Germany; 29,000 by the UK. Nope. Or maybe he said it by accident? But then he said it again, and again. Could it have been a straight lie? A dicey move, in parliament. Not exactly: he was referring to the number of people taken in under a resettlement scheme over the past seven years, in which the UK numbers do surpass other nations’. Overall, our figures are absolutely dwarfed by even much smaller neighbours. The same old prime minister arrived in parliament, in other words, with the same old manoeuvre of turning something technically true into an untruth by stripping it of context. But it’s not the same old world any more. When you stand up and deliberately mislead, call the worst the best, turn facts on their head, it all sounds a bit Putin-esque. He had another couple of lines – that he didn’t believe in letting refugees in without checks, and that Conservatives must be humane and have sanctuary in their blood, because look how many on its frontbench were descended from refugees. Those were both weaker, but less murderous-dictator-adjacent. So many members, from so many parties, stood up to challenge Johnson on the UK’s response to the refugee crisis. The SNP’s Ian Blackford gave a persuasive and workmanlike rundown of how far short we were falling. Ed Davey got Johnson on the hop, as he found himself rattling through the UK visa centres in eastern Europe, muffling one city into another in frantic underenunciation. One of the most affecting speakers was from the Tory benches, Julian Smith, whose voice quavered slightly as he asked when his own party was going to show some humanity. Keir Starmer went another way, as they say in casting: the chancellor’s measures on fuel bills were nothing like enough to meet the situation, so “when will the prime minister force the chancellor to U-turn?” It was a peculiar angle, dispersing the fault between Johnson and Sunak, and ham-fistedly obvious about not expecting an answer. But it transpired to be just some fancy footwork before his main attack: BP has made £9.5bn out of prices that were surging even before Ukraine, and Shell made £14bn, “in their own words”, said Starmer, “more money than they know what to do with”. His call for a windfall tax on energy company profits is probably as close to popular radicalism as he’s prepared to sail. Johnson replied that, if you tax these corporations, they will just pass that cost on to the consumer. It was ironic that they had a pointless barney about nuclear power right after (a leader who has built no nuclear power stations, accusing an opponent who’s never been in government of failing to build nuclear power stations). That answer on windfall tax – what’s the point of taxing companies, when the consumer will always pay? – is radioactive for Johnson. It will sound worse and worse, as fuel bills rise. Perhaps it was because he realised this that Johnson started mangling his words, or perhaps in some corner of his limbic brain, he thought that accelerating his speech would make the time go faster. He figured out eventually that it was the other way around. Starmer has found a laddish mojo in his responses, all “come off it” and “does he expect us to buy that?” Two questions from Johnson’s backbenchers were downright peculiar. Greg Clark, the MP for Tunbridge Wells, asked if the prime minister would like to join him in wishing a happy birthday to the second world war veteran Colin Bell. Why yes, Boris Johnson would love to do that. His answer was so baggy, his relief so audible, he sounded a breath away from launching into the song. Richard Holden, the MP for North West Durham, wanted to know whether, when his constituency’s new cottage hospital was built, the prime minister would grant him the honour of opening it? It’s nothing new for a backbench chancer in a hurry to lob an asinine question to give some rhetorical respite to a flailing leader, but these were on a whole new level, reaching for desperate patriotic bass notes, promising photo ops and, who knows, maybe a dressing up opportunity, as if dealing with a … well, maybe not an autocrat: but autocrat-adjacent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2023/apr/03/travel-back-in-time-six-of-britains-best-heritage-railways","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-03T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"‘Travel back in time’: six of Britain’s best heritage railways","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/apr/03/travel-back-in-time-six-of-britains-best-heritage-railways","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2023/apr/03/travel-back-in-time-six-of-britains-best-heritage-railways","fields":{"headline":"‘Travel back in time’: six of Britain’s best heritage railways","bodyText":"This year marks the centenary of Britain’s top mechanical celebrity: the Flying Scotsman locomotive. It emerged from the Doncaster works of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923 and is celebrating its anniversary with an exhibition at the National Railway Museum in York, special excursions and visits to heritage railways around the country. Scotsman is often described as an icon, but what exactly does it represent? I would say early British PR. There were Flying Scotsman ashtrays, jigsaws and paperweights – and the loco often hauled the train of nearly the same name, the Flying Scotsman (train names being preceded by the definite article), which was glamourised by the LNER, with its onboard barber, cinema carriage and Louis XIV-style restaurant car. But why all the glitz? The LNER, like most showoffs, was insecure. The main transport trend during the interwar heyday of the Flying Scotsman was the rise of the internal combustion engine. For the first time, trains were not necessarily top dog in the transport world, hence the paranoid slogan that began to appear on LNER posters: “It’s Quicker By Rail”. As Bob Gwynne, author of a book on the loco, puts it: “The Scotsman campaign was partly meant to lend a warm glow to the railways in general.” In that sense, the Flying Scotsman was an anti-car icon, which gives it in retrospect environmental credibility. And while most of its centenary events are sold out, you can see evidence of the railways’ historical battle against the roads on any visit to Britain’s heritage railways. North Yorkshire Moors Railway The NYMR is – like many heritage railways – a line restored by volunteers after being closed by Dr Richard Beeching in the 1960s. Beeching was installed as British Railways chairman by the Conservative transport minister Ernest “Ernie” Marples – a veritable Dick Dastardly, if you’re a rail fan. Marples drove a Jag and founded a company that built roads. He encouraged Beeching (a physicist) to take a “scientific” approach to Britain’s railways, which turned out to mean slashing the network by a third without regard for the utility of a line, or indeed its beauty – and the one through the wild North York Moors from Whitby to Pickering was particularly beautiful. Eighteen miles of it – from Grosmont to Pickering – were reopened in 1966, and the NYMR runs some luxurious teak carriages hauled by the old LNER expresses, including one that featured on The Flying Scotsman train. These carriages, with their art deco mirrors and plush seats, were boudoir-like to seduce wealthy business travellers away from the new trunk roads. Their mellow, tawny interiors are complemented by the russet shades of the hillside bracken in winter or a moorland sunset at any time of year. The NYMR runs specially adapted steam trains from Grosmont to the gracious, waterfront station at Whitby, which is on the national network. Strathspey Railway Aviemore’s pretty chalet-like station is on the Highland main line. But there’s a very prominent petrol station nearby, and on a sunny day the town, with its low-rise architecture and wide car parks under big skies, has something of an LA feel about it – a reminder that the Highlands are a magnet for motorists. Since 1978, the Strathspey Railway – which revives a stretch of the old Perth-Inverness (via Aviemore) line closed by Beeching – has been a corrective to that. The line runs through the Cairngorms national park, and the SR website states: “We are delighted to welcome customers with bicycles or dogs.” When I was last on platform 3 of Aviemore station, where the SR is based, there were plenty of both, sometimes with a fishing rod thrown in. As our journey began, the adjacent fields and woods of birch or pine were sun-dappled, but a purplish haze over the Cairngorms to the west indicated heavy rain. “Oh,” said the train guard, “there’s usually about five types of weather going on there at once.” Swanage Railway Beeching had it in for lines to seaside resorts, whose ridership was minimal in the off season. The pretty line to Swanage in Dorset via Corfe Castle appeared to have dodged his axe, but it closed in 1972. It reopened in stages from 1979, the volunteers having to fight off a road expansion scheme. Victorian Swanage was “made” by the railway, and the alliance has been restored. You can’t see the sea from the station but you can hear it when it’s rough, and when it’s calm the genteel station announcements are audible from much of the town. In BR Southern Region green, the station is redolent of that 1950s seaside innocence that Beeching assailed. It displays vintage posters featuring bathing beauties with permed hair and slogans aimed at the automotive enemy: “Arrive Earlier by Train”. Some SR services connect to Wareham on the national network. Ecclesbourne Valley Railway The Ecclesbourne Valley line in Derbyshire closed to passengers in 1947, but the track was used to test diesel multiple units, seen as key to the cheap operation of country branches being menaced by cars. Today, the star attraction of the EVR (reopened in 2002) is a single unit from the first generation of those early diesels – the Derby Lightweights, which are as endearing as their name suggests. The unit is dark green, with straw-coloured “speed whiskers” painted on the front – a kind of go-faster stripe that actually suggests the moustache of a dandified old man. The seat coverings are a lovely, paler green, and all this verdancy harmonises restfully with the gently rolling hillsides and the small but dignified Victorian stations. The EVR shares Duffield station with the somewhat brasher units of the Midland main line. Kent and East Sussex Railway This line opened in 1900, serving farms. It closed in 1961 and was revived from 1974. It was a “Colonel Stephens railway”, meaning it was part of the empire of country lines built on the cheap by the maverick Colonel Holman Fred Stephens. A typical Stephens line was not fenced off but would just wander through a field. A station might be nothing more than an old carriage; signals were usually dispensed with. At its Tenterden terminus (accessible by bus from Ashford or Headcorn mainline stations), the K&amp;ES has a fascinating museum dedicated to the colonel. There’s a waxwork of him sitting at his desk – a hawklike, formidably moustachioed man. He looked like a cad, but he fought the good fight – against the car. Posters around the K&amp;ES carry his peremptory slogans: “Travel in safety across the country, away from the dusty and crowded roads”, or simply: “Travel back in time”. You can do just that on the trains of the K&amp;ES, which are no more disruptive of the sleepy Kentish Weald than the adjacent River Rother. Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway As mentioned, most of the Scotsman centenary events are sold out – but if you travel to the RH&amp;D in Kent (accessible by bus from Folkestone, Ashford or Canterbury), you can see some 1920s locos modelled after Scotsman, but one-third the size. One is called Green Goddess, another Southern Maid. You might see their drivers polishing their boilers prior to setting off from Hythe, running behind sea-facing bungalows towards the great grey beach (and nuclear power stations) at Dungeness – a setting that makes this 15-inch gauge line even more dreamlike. The question of whether it is a heritage railway is moot, since it has been operating more or less continuously since 1927 and it’s not just a pleasure line. Local people can buy shares in the railway, thus getting discounted travel for car-free shopping in Hythe. So even though it was founded by a motor racing enthusiast, Captain Jack Howey, the RH&amp;D fights the good fight.

Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has travelled to Belarus to meet the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. Putin described the talks as “very productive” and insisted that Russia has no interest in “absorbing” anyone, adding that unspecified “enemies” wanted to stop Russia’s integration with Belarus. Lukashenko said high level Belarusian-Russian negotiations covered “the entire range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations”. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk earlier today ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk. The foreign ministers discussed “specific topical issues, the efforts to counter the illegal sanctions of the West, as well as interaction on international platforms”, Belarusian state media cited Belarus’s foreign ministry as saying, as well as having “touched upon trade and economic cooperation matters and the implementation of joint projects”. Belarus’s defence ministry said it had completed a series of inspections of its armed forces’ military preparedness, hours ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk. Weeks of military manoeuvres and inspections have raised fears in Kyiv that Belarus, which acted as a staging post for Russia to launch its invasion of Ukraine in February, could be preparing to take a more active role in the conflict once again. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally. “Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus, is our constant priority,” Zelenskiy said on Sunday after a meeting with Ukraine’s top military command. “We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios.” The exiled Belarus opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has warned that the chances of Minsk sending soldiers into Ukraine “may increase in coming weeks”. Kyiv was “right to prepare” for Minsk to join Moscow’s new offensive because the probability “might increase in coming weeks”, Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with Kyiv Post. The head of Moldova’s security service, Alexandru Musteata, has warned of a “very high” risk of a new Russian offensive towards his country’s east. Russia still aims to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, Musteata said, adding that his agency believed Moscow was looking at several scenarios to reach Moldova and that it was possible an offensive would be launched in January-February or later in March-April. A Russian drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba said. Russia unleashed 35 “kamikaze” drones on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday as many people slept, hitting critical infrastructure in and around Kyiv in Moscow’s third air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days. Ukraine’s atomic energy agency accused Russia of flouting nuclear safety by sending a “kamikaze” drone over part of a nuclear power plant in Mykolaiv region just after Sunday midnight. Energoatom said the Iranian-made Shahed drone had been detected over the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant, and called on the international nuclear community to protect atomic sites from the risks of war. Air raid alerts were issued across Kyiv and most of Ukraine on Monday early afternoon, officials said. There were no immediate reports of attacks and the alarm was ended about 20 minutes after the alert. Ukraine’s air force said it had shot down 30 out of 35 Russian-launched Shahed drones overnight. The Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 kamikaze drones were reportedly launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov, the force added. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had shot down four US-made HARM anti-radiation missiles over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, in the space of 24 hours, the state-run TASS news agency reported. One person died and several were injured by Ukrainian shelling in the region on Sunday morning, the region’s governor said. Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut in the country’s eastern Donetsk region, according to Zelenskiy. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national address. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.” The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said he believes Russia’s war in Ukraine “will go on” and does not see a prospect for “serious” peace talks in the immediate future. Speaking to reporters during his annual end-of-year conference in New York, Guterres said he “strongly hoped that peace could be reached in 2023, citing the “consequences” for Ukraine’s people, Russian society and the global economy if a deal is not found Rishi Sunak said that the west should reject unilateral calls by the Kremlin for a ceasefire in Ukraine and focus on “degrading Russia’s capability to regroup and to resupply” at a meeting of European leaders in Latvia. The UK prime minister was speaking at a summit of the 10-country Joint Expeditionary Force in the Latvian capital at a time of heightened concern as to whether Britain will continue the robust support for Ukraine that began under Boris Johnson. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked western leaders meeting in Latvia to ramp up the supply of a wide range of weapons systems to his country. He called on leaders “to do everything to accelerate the defeat” of Russia, and said supplying air defence systems to Kyiv would be “one of the most successful steps against Russian aggression and this step is required right now”. EU ministers have agreed a plan to cap the price of gas, ending months of argument over how to handle the cost of soaring energy prices after Russia cut gas supplies to Europe. A gas price cap will kick in if prices on the main European gas exchange, the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF), exceed €180 (£157) a megawatt-hour for three consecutive working days, far lower than the European Commission’s original proposal of €275 a MWh, which had been derided by cap-supporting countries as a joke. The Canadian government has announced plans to seize $26m in sanctioned assets from the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, with the proceeds from the forfeiture to go towards reconstruction in Ukraine and compensation of victims of the Russian invasion. The move marked the first case of the Canadian government using new powers to pursue the seizure of assets belonging to sanctioned individuals, it said in a statement. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thank you for reading. Vladimir Putin has described Russian-Belarusian talks in Minsk as “very productive” after his one-on-one meeting with Alexander Lukashenko, Belarusian state media reported. Speaking to reporters at a joint press conference with his Belarusian counterpart, Putin insisted that Russia has no interest in “absorbing” anyone, and that unspecified “enemies” wanted to stop Russia’s integration with Belarus. The future of Belarusian and Russian peoples “is being determined now”, Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta cited President Lukashenko as saying. He added: Today we can unequivocally state: together we were able not only to survive, but also to find opportunities for the development of our economies. He said negotiations of the two leaders with larger government delegations in Minsk had been productive, and said they discussed “the entire range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations”, according to Belta. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said he believes Russia’s war in Ukraine “will go on” and does not see a prospect for “serious” peace talks in the immediate future. Speaking to reporters during his annual end-of-year conference in New York, Guterres said he “will not relent in the pursuit of peace in Ukraine in line with international law and the United Nations Charter”, referring to the UN charter’s key principle of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. He said he was “not optimistic” about the possibility of effective Ukraine and Russia peace talks in the immediate future, adding: I do believe that the military confrontation will go on. Nevertheless, he said he “strongly hoped that peace could be reached in 2023, citing the “consequences” for Ukraine’s people, Russian society and the global economy if a deal is not found. He added: All these are reasons for us to do everything possible to make a peace solution happen before the end of 2023. In the meantime, he said he would focus on increasing the efficiency of a UN-brokered deal that resumed Ukraine’s Black Sea food and fertiliser shipments, continue to try to restart the export of Russian ammonia via Ukraine and seek to accelerate the exchange of prisoners of war. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Minsk, where Russia’s president Vladimir Putin has been holding talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko. The head of Moldova’s security service, Alexandru Musteata, has warned of a “very high” risk of a new Russian offensive towards his country’s east, echoing recent messages from several Ukrainian military commanders that Moscow is preparing for a major new offensive early next year. Russia still aims to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, Musteata told the TVR-Moldova television channel, as reported by Reuters. Musteata said: The question is not whether the Russian Federation will undertake a new advance towards Moldova’s territory, but when it will do so. He said his agency believed Moscow was looking at several scenarios to reach Moldova and that it was possible an offensive would be launched in January-February or later in March-April. Transnistria, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists and permanently hosts 1,500 Russian troops as well as a large arms depot, borders western Ukraine. Musteata said Russia wanted its forces to link up with those forces in Transnistria. Boris Johnson’s Ukraine policy may not have always been sophisticated – “Dobryi den, everybody!” – but his enthusiasm was welcomed in Kyiv. Six months of Conservative party chaos later, his successor but one, Rishi Sunak, is yet to demonstrate he is as supportive at a time when Ukraine needs the west to dig in. A leak at the start of the weekend said that Sunak had ordered an internal assessment of the significance of British military aid to Ukraine. Revelation of the Whitehall exercise was accompanied by a pointed briefing to the BBC, accusing the prime minister of resorting to a “Goldman Sachs dashboard” approach. “Wars aren’t won [by dashboards]. Wars are won on instinct,” the critic continued – a demonstration that cracks are appearing in Britain’s policy towards Ukraine. Downing Street may have rejected that characterisation on Monday, but a Ukraine review is on. “The PM is staying closely across the detail of developments in Ukraine and the impact of UK and international support,” a spokesperson said. “To ensure we are delivering the best possible assistance.” It is also no secret in Westminster that Sunak and his defence secretary, Ben Wallace, are not close. Wallace has been the ever present in Britain’s Ukraine policy, but also a long-term supporter of Johnson who then backed the ill-fated Liz Truss and flirted with backing Johnson in an unlikely comeback against Sunak. Read the full story here: EU ministers have reached an agreement to cap gas prices, after weeks of talks and despite concerns that such an intervention could cause greater volatility in the market. Ministers agreed to trigger a cap if prices on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub’s front-month contract exceed €180 (£157) per megawatt hour for three days. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said the deal “means the end of market manipulation” by Russia and its energy giant Gazprom. The European Commission stands ready to suspend the agreed price cap if an analysis by regulators shows the risks of the measure outweigh the benefits, the bloc’s energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, told reporters. The exiled Belarus opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has warned that the chances of Minsk sending soldiers into Ukraine “may increase in coming weeks” as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing for its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. Tsikhanouskaya’s remarks came as Vladimir Putin travelled to Belarus for talks with Alexander Lukashenko, a meeting that the Belarusian president said would cover the “military-political situation” in the region as well as economic cooperation. Ukraine will be closely monitoring the talks. Last week, several Ukrainian military commanders said Russia might try another attempt at invading the country from the north. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that Ukraine was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally. Kyiv was “right to prepare” for Minsk to join Moscow’s new offensive because the probability “might increase in coming weeks”, Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with Kyiv Post. She said: Belarusian armed forces are part of the society and share the same view on the war – 86% of Belarusians are against participation in the war. This has stopped the order to send Belarusian troops to the battlefield in Ukraine. It was not a good will of dictators or Lukashenko’s standing up to Putin – he is fully on the Kremlin’s side. However, the probability of such an order remains and might increase in coming weeks. I think the Ukrainian leadership is right to prepare for this scenario even though it means distracting significant forces from active war zones in the south-east. Lukashenko “sees Ukraine as a threat”, she said, adding that “a democratic, free, European Ukraine is a bad example to the dictatorships of Lukashenko and Putin, therefore this war is a logical decision for them.” Asked what Russia and Belarus’ join aim might be, she replied: To destroy Ukraine, its European aspirations and national identity, and bring it under their control. The Canadian government has announced plans to seize $26m in sanctioned assets from the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, with the proceeds from the forfeiture to go towards reconstruction in Ukraine and compensation of victims of the Russian invasion. The move marked the first case of the Canadian government using new powers to pursue the seizure of assets belonging to sanctioned individuals, it said in a statement. Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, said the government would “continue to pressure the Russian regime and those who have benefited from Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine”. It’s 6.15pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has travelled to Belarus to meet the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. In the run-up to the meeting, which will be Putin’s first visit to Belarus since 2019, Lukashenko said the two leaders would discuss the “military-political situation” in the region as well as economic cooperation. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk earlier today ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk. The foreign ministers discussed “specific topical issues, the efforts to counter the illegal sanctions of the West, as well as interaction on international platforms”, Belarusian state media cited Belarus’s foreign ministry as saying, as well as having “touched upon trade and economic cooperation matters and the implementation of joint projects”. Belarus’s defence ministry said it had completed a series of inspections of its armed forces’ military preparedness, hours ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk. Weeks of military manoeuvres and inspections have raised fears in Kyiv that Belarus, which acted as a staging post for Russia to launch its invasion of Ukraine in February, could be preparing to take a more active role in the conflict once again. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally. “Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus, is our constant priority,” Zelenskiy said on Sunday after a meeting with Ukraine’s top military command. “We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios.” Berlin had “concerns” about Putin’s visit to Belarus and whether talks between the Russian and Belarusian presidents will impact Minsk’s role in the war in Ukraine, a German government spokesperson said. Steffen Hebestreit said there was a possibility that Belarus could ramp up aid to the Russian army, but warned to wait for the results of the talks and not to draw any conclusions in advance. A Russian drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba said. Russia unleashed 35 “kamikaze” drones on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday as many people slept, hitting critical infrastructure in and around Kyiv in Moscow’s third air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days. Ukraine’s atomic energy agency accused Russia of flouting nuclear safety by sending a “kamikaze” drone over part of a nuclear power plant in Mykolaiv region just after Sunday midnight. Energoatom said the Iranian-made Shahed drone had been detected over the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant, and called on the international nuclear community to protect atomic sites from the risks of war. Air raid alerts were issued across Kyiv and most of Ukraine on Monday early afternoon, officials said. There were no immediate reports of attacks and the alarm was ended about 20 minutes after the alert. Ukraine’s air force said it had shot down 30 out of 35 Russian-launched Shahed drones overnight. The Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 kamikaze drones were reportedly launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov, the force added. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had shot down four US-made HARM anti-radiation missiles over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, in the space of 24 hours, the state-run TASS news agency reported. One person died and several were injured by Ukrainian shelling in the region on Sunday morning, the region’s governor said. Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut in the country’s eastern Donetsk region, according to Zelenskiy. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national address. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.” Russian military proxy group Wagner continues to take a major role in attritional combat around Bakhmut, the UK Ministry of Defence said. In recent months, the group had developed offensive tactics to make use of the large number of poorly trained convicts it has recruited, the ministry noted in its latest intelligence report. Rishi Sunak said that the west should reject unilateral calls by the Kremlin for a ceasefire in Ukraine and focus on “degrading Russia’s capability to regroup and to resupply” at a meeting of European leaders in Latvia. The UK prime minister was speaking at a summit of the 10-country Joint Expeditionary Force in the Latvian capital at a time of heightened concern as to whether Britain will continue the robust support for Ukraine that began under Boris Johnson. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked western leaders meeting in Latvia to ramp up the supply of a wide range of weapons systems to his country. He called on leaders “to do everything to accelerate the defeat” of Russia, and said supplying air defence systems to Kyiv would be “one of the most successful steps against Russian aggression and this step is required right now”. Germany has “concerns” about Vladimir Putin’s visit to Belarus and whether talks between the Russian leader and his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, will affect Minsk’s role in the war in Ukraine, a German government spokesperson said. Speaking at a briefing this afternoon, Steffen Hebestreit told reporters that Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, was fully aware of Putin’s visit to Belarus today, Ukraine’s state-run news agency Ukrinform reported. Hebestreit said: Of course, there are concerns about what this visit might entail: whether the role of Belarus in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine will once again change or be modified. He said there was a possibility that Belarus could ramp up aid to the Russian army, but warned to wait for the results of the talks and not to draw any conclusions in advance. EU energy ministers have agreed to a gas price cap, a spokesperson for the Czech presidency of the EU, Dmitrij Černikov, has said. Vladimir Putin said Belarus was Russia’s closest ally in brief remarks during visit to Minsk to hold talks with Alexander Lukashenko. The Belarusian media outlet Nexta has a clip of the Russian and Belarusian presidents as they began the open part of their negotiations. In comments published by Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass, Putin said Moscow was ready to continue helping Minsk to develop its nuclear industry. Putin was quoted as saying at talks with Lukashenko: We are intensively working in almost all areas. In the energy sector – as we noted with [Belarusian president] Alexander Grigorievich [Lukashenko], Russia, to its own detriment, nevertheless continues the nuclear project – we are building a nuclear power plant. A resident walks past a damaged house following a barrage of drone strikes from Russia in Stari Bezradychi village, Kyiv region. Rishi Sunak praised the 10-country Joint Expeditionary Force’s support of Ukraine as “heartening” in a meeting with Latvia’s prime minister. Speaking at the start of their bilateral at the close of the alliance’s summit in Riga, the UK prime minister told Krišjānis Kariņš: To have a group of partners and allies who think so alike on these incredibly important questions of our connected security, and then are backing up those sentiments with action when it comes to supporting Ukraine, I think is very heartening. Kariņš replied: I think you nailed it when you made that comment to all of us around the table: ‘it’s not just talk, it’s also the walk’. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine’s Kyiv region, in the aftermath of a Russian drone attack in the early hours of Monday. Ukraine’s atomic energy agency has accused Russia of flouting nuclear safety by sending a “kamikaze” drone over part of a nuclear power plant in Mykolaiv region just after midnight. Writing on Telegram, Energoatom said the Iranian-made Shahed drone had been detected early Monday over the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant. Energoatom said: This is an absolutely unacceptable violation of nuclear and radiation safety. The agency called on the international nuclear community to protect atomic sites from the risks of war. It has been possible to independently verify these claims. Vladimir Putin has landed in Minsk for talks with the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, Russian state media reported, amid growing fears that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. The Russian leader’s trip will be his first to Minsk since 2019, and comes as he has been taking a more public role in his war in Ukraine. Lukashenko has previously allowed the Kremlin to use his country as a platform to send tens of thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine, while Russian war jets have taken off from Belarusian bases. But Lukashenko has not joined the war directly or sent his own troops into the fight, at times even subtly criticising the invasion, saying he felt the conflict was “dragging on”. Speaking to Russian news agencies, the Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Belarus was Russia’s “number one ally”, but that suggestions that Moscow wanted to pressure Minsk into joining what it calls its “special military operation” were “stupid and unfounded fabrications”. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk earlier today ahead of President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Belarus. The foreign ministers discussed “specific topical issues, the efforts to counter the illegal sanctions of the West, as well as interaction on international platforms”, Belarusian state media cited Belarus’ foreign ministry as saying. The pair also “touched upon trade and economic cooperation matters and the implementation of joint projects”, the ministry said. Rishi Sunak said that the west should reject unilateral calls by the Kremlin for a ceasefire in Ukraine and focus on “degrading Russia’s capability to regroup and to resupply” at a meeting of European leaders in Latvia. The UK prime minister was speaking at a summit of the 10-country Joint Expeditionary Force in the Latvian capital at a time of heightened concern as to whether Britain will continue the robust support for Ukraine that began under Boris Johnson. Rejecting Russian-promoted ceasefires has been the west’s position for some time – but reiterations of the position are welcome in Kyiv, given its anxiety that the west could eventually lose interest in the war in Ukraine and slow the supply of weapons the country so badly needs. A call to prevent Russia from regrouping indicates Britain endorses Ukraine’s ongoing counter offensive, and comes the morning after the UK said it would ship hundreds of thousands more of artillery shells to Kyiv, under a £250m contract. EU energy ministers are meeting in Brussels today to attempt to agree to a cap on gas prices, following months of debate without agreement despite two emergency meetings. Ministers are considering a new compromise proposed by the Czech Republic, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, according to Reuters. In the draft proposal, a cap would be triggered if prices on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub’s front-month contract exceed €180 (£157) per megawatt hour for three days. The figure in the draft proposal, seen by the news agency, is far lower than the €275/MWh originally proposed by the European Commission last month, which about a dozen countries including Belgium, Poland and Greece had dismissed as too high. Pro-cap countries say the cap must be below €200/MWh to tackle the high gas prices that have inflated citizens’ energy bills and stoked record-high inflation. But Germany, the Netherlands and Austria oppose the cap, which they say could disrupt Europe’s energy markets and divert much-needed gas cargoes away from the EU and to other regions. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, travels to Belarus on Monday to meet the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. In the run-up to the meeting, which will be Putin’s first visit to Belarus since 2019, Lukashenko said that the two leaders would discuss the “military-political situation” in the region as well as economic cooperation. The longtime Belarusian strongman, who oversaw a violent crackdown on anti-government protesters in 2020, stressed that his country’s “sovereignty and independence” was not up for debate, as observers believe that Putin’s visit serves to pull Belarus into the war in Ukraine. “I would like to emphasise this feature once again: no one, except us, governs Belarus,” Lukashenko said in a statement published by the presidential press service. We must always proceed from the fact that we are a sovereign state and independent. Ukraine will be closely monitoring the talks. Last week, several Ukrainian military commanders warned Russia may try another attempt at invading the country from the north. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday said that Ukraine was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally. “Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus, is our constant priority,” Zelenskiy said after a meeting on Sunday with Ukraine’s top military command. We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios. Read the full story here: Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has said Ukraine will “neither surrender nor fulfil” Russia’s ultimatums. The end to the conflict “can only be accelerated by increasing artillery/tanks supply”, he wrote in a post on Twitter directed at western leaders. An air raid alert has been issued across Kyiv and most of Ukraine, according to officials. A statement by the Kyiv regional military administration reads: Air alarm in the Kyiv region. Stay tuned for further posts. Deutsche Welle’s Emmanuelle Chaze shares a map of where air sirens have sounded in Ukraine: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked western leaders meeting in Latvia to ramp up the supply of a wide range of weapons systems to his country. Addressing a meeting in Riga of leaders of countries in the Joint Expeditionary Force, which includes Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, Zelenskiy said: Russian aggression can and must fail. The task now is to make sure it happens faster. I call upon you to do everything to accelerate the defeat of the occupiers. Millions had been left without heat and water after Russia launched further attacks using Iranian drones last night, he said. He continued: May I ask you to increase the possibility of supplying air defence systems to our country ... 100% air shield for Ukraine, that would be one of the most successful steps against Russian aggression and this step is required right now. The time in Kyiv is nearly 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s stories so far: A Russian drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba has said. Russia unleashed 35 “kamikaze” drones on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday as many people slept, hitting critical infrastructure in and around Kyiv in Moscow’s third air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days.

Russian troops that were moved to Belarus in October to become part of a regional formation will conduct battalion tactical exercises, the Russian Interfax news agency reported on Monday, citing the Russian defence ministry. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is due to fly to Belarus on Monday amid fears he intends to pressure the former Soviet ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine and open a new front. His visit for talks with the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, will be his first to Minsk since 2019. Russian military proxy group Wagner continues to take a major role in attritional combat around Bakhmut in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. In recent months, the group has developed offensive tactics to make use of the large number of poorly trained convicts it has recruited, the ministry notes in its latest intelligence report. Rishi Sunak has touched down in the Latvian capital, where he is meeting northern European allies to discuss countering Russian aggression. He will urge fellow leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force to stand firm in their support for Ukraine, after announcing a major new artillery package for the war-torn nation. EU countries will need to reach a compromise on a gas price cap on Monday, and the latest proposal on the table offers a good basis to do so, Malta’s energy minister, Miriam Dalli, has said. “What the presidency is proposing is a very good step in the right direction,” Dalli said before entering a meeting of the EU’s energy ministers. Four people in the southern Russian border region of Belgorod were reportedly wounded by shelling on Sunday, the governor said. Witnesses reported loud blasts in the regional capital. Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national address. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.” That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had shot down four US-made HARM anti-radiation missiles over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, in the space of 24 hours, the state-run TASS news agency has reported. One person died and several were injured by Ukrainian shelling in the region on Sunday morning, the region’s governor told Reuters.

Rishi Sunak has touched down in the Latvian capital, where he is meeting northern European allies to discuss countering Russian aggression. The UK prime minister landed in snowy Riga at 11.20am local time, stepping out of the plane into a gusty -4C, PA Media reported. He will urge fellow leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force to stand firm in their support for Ukraine, after announcing a major new artillery package for the war-torn nation. He will continue his whistlestop tour by flying to Estonia later on Monday, where he will meet British troops and sign a new technology partnership. Russia’s drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba has said.

I’m convinced that today we will mange to compromise, I believe that the willingness is there. Today is crunch time.” Critical power infrastructure burns after a drone attack in Kyiv this morning Ukraine’s air force says it shot down 30 out of 35 Russian-launched Shahed drones overnight. The Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 kamikaze drones were reportedly launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov, the force added. Russian troops that were moved to Belarus in October to become part of a regional formation will conduct battalion tactical exercises, the Russian Interfax news agency reported on Monday, citing the Russian defence ministry. Interfax cited the ministry’s statement as saying: The final assessment of the combat capability and combat readiness of the units will be given by the command at the final stage of coordination – after the battalion tactical exercises have been conducted.” It was not immediately clear when and where in Belarus the exercises will be conducted. Belarus defence ministry said in October that 9,000 Russian troops were moving to the country as part of a “regional grouping” of forces to protect its borders. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is set to fly to Belarus on Monday amid fears he intends to pressure the former Soviet ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine and open a new front. His visit for talks with the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, will be his first to Minsk since 2019. Ukrainian joint forces commander Serhiy Nayev said: During (these talks) questions will be worked out for further aggression against Ukraine and the broader involvement of the Belarusian armed forces in the operation against Ukraine, in particular, in our opinion, also on the ground.” Ukraine’s top general, Valery Zaluzhniy, told the Economist last week that Russia was preparing 200,000 fresh troops for a major offensive that could come from the east, south or even from Belarus as early as January, but more likely in spring. There has been constant Russian and Belarusian military activity for months in Belarus. Russia also used its ally as a launch pad for an abortive attack on Kyiv in February. Moscow and Minsk have since set up a joint regional unit of forces in Belarus and held numerous military exercises. Three Russian warplanes and an airborne early warning and control aircraft were deployed to Belarus last week. Foreign diplomats say Lukashenko, a pariah in the west who relies heavily on Russian support, understands it would be a deeply unpopular step at home for him to commit troops to Ukraine. But he has already supported Russia’s war extensively. Some military analysts see the manoeuvring as a ploy to make Ukraine commit forces to its north so it is more exposed to Russian assaults elsewhere. The UK is set to announce a major new artillery package for Ukraine as British prime minister Rishi Sunak prepares to meet with his Nordic, Baltic and Dutch counterparts in Riga, Latvia, on Monday. According to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office and as cited by Agence France-Presse, he will announce Britain’s intention to supply “hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition next year under a £250m ($304m) contract that will ensure a constant flow of critical artillery ammunition to Ukraine throughout 2023”. The prime minister will travel to Latvia for the leaders’ gathering of Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) countries, including Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania and the Netherlands, which will be addressed by Ukraine’s president, Volodomyr Zelenksiy. From the Arctic Circle to the Isle of Wight, the UK and our European allies have been in lockstep in our response to the invasion of Ukraine, and we remain steadfast in our ambition for peace in Europe once again,” Sunak said ahead of the visit. But to achieve peace, we must deter aggression and our deployments across the region together are vital in ensuring we are able to respond to the gravest of threats. I know this Joint Expeditionary Force summit will only underline our close friendships and unwavering support for Ukraine.” No 10 said the meeting would also discuss intelligence sharing between JEF countries, threats to infrastructure and hybrid threats posed by Russian aggression and bolstering support to Finland and Sweden ahead of their accession to Nato. Further announcements on joint military exercises are also expected. Sunak is then expected to fly on to Estonia, where he will meet UK and Nato troops serving on the military alliance’s eastern flank on the Russian border. New information published by Ukrainian authorities suggests that Russia’s earlier drone attack on Kyiv damaged critical infrastructure and injured two people. Kyiv’s regional governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, wrote on Telegram this morning: Infrastructure objects and private houses were damaged as a result of a night drone attack in the Kyiv region … two victims. People are given help – they are under the supervision of doctors.” Russian military proxy group Wagner continues to take a major role in attritional combat around Bakhmut in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. In recent months, the group has developed offensive tactics to make use of the large number of poorly trained convicts it has recruited, the ministry notes in its latest intelligence report. Individual fighters are likely issued a smart phone or tablet which shows the individual’s designated axis of advance and assault objective superimposed on commercial satellite imagery. At platoon level and above, commanders likely remain in cover and give orders over radios, informed by video feeds from small un-crewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). Individuals and sections are ordered to proceed on the preplanned route, often with fire-support, but less often alongside armoured vehicles. Wagner operatives who deviate from their assault routes without authorisation are likely being threatened with summary execution. These brutal tactics aim to conserve Wagner’s rare assets of experienced commanders and armoured vehicles, at the expense of the more readily available convict-recruits, which the organisation assesses as expendable.” At least two powerful explosions rocked Ukraine’s capital in the early hours of Monday morning, as officials claim the city was hit by a series of Russian drones. Multiple local news sources reported the blasts in central Kyiv. Several loud blasts were also heard in the city’s surrounding regions, Reuters witnesses reported. A fire was also reported in Kyiv’s central Shevchenkivskyi district. Ukraine’s armed forces first sounded the alarm in a Telegram alert about 2am local time, saying the military had sent air defences to protect the capital from drone attacks. The Kyiv city state administration also sent an alert urging residents to seek shelter. It later added that more than 20 Iranian-made drones were detected over Kyiv’s air space and at least 15 of them were shot down. Oleksiy Kuleba, head of the Kyiv regional military administration, said air defence works were operating in the region and claimed the city was under a drone attack. The drone attack continues,” he said. Kyiv’s military administration later said that nine Iranian-made Shahed drones were shot down in Kyiv’s airspace. In a Telegram update, the administration said: Air alert continues in Kyiv. The enemy is attacking the capital with ‘Shahed’ barrage ammunition. Air defence is being at work.” It was not immediately clear whether the blasts were air defence systems destroying the drones or hitting targets. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. A series of explosions have rocked Ukraine’s capital Kyiv in the early hours of this morning, according to regional officials. Meanwhile, the UK is set to announce a major new artillery package for Ukraine as British prime minister Rishi Sunak prepares to meet with his Nordic, Baltic and Dutch counterparts in Riga, Latvia, on Monday. For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: The UK is set to announce a major new artillery package for Ukraine as British prime minister Rishi Sunak prepares to meet with his Nordic, Baltic and Dutch counterparts in Riga, Latvia, on Monday. According to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office and as cited by Agence France-Presse, he will announce Britain’s intention to supply “hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition next year under a £250m ($304m) contract that will ensure a constant flow of critical artillery ammunition to Ukraine throughout 2023”. Ukraine said Russian shelling targeted the southern city of Kherson on Sunday, which has faced repeated attacks since Kyiv’s forces recaptured it last month. “Another blow was delivered to the city centre. Three people were injured. They received shrapnel wounds, one wounded is in a serious condition,” deputy head of the president’s office Kyrylo Tymoshenko said. Regional governor Yaroslav Yanushevich said on Sunday that Moscow’s troops had carried out 54 attacks on Kherson region with artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, tanks and mortars over the previous day, leaving three dead and wounding six others. Four people in the southern Russian border region of Belgorod were reportedly wounded by shelling on Sunday, the governor said. Witnesses reported loud blasts in the regional capital. Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national address. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.” Power has been restored to three million more Ukrainians after the latest Russian attacks on infrastructure, bringing the total to nine million after two days, Ukraine’s president has said. “Electricity supplies have been restored to a further three million Ukrainians,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his Sunday evening video address. “That means after the terrorist strikes on Friday, we have results already for nine million of our people.” Heating has also been fully restored to Kyiv, the city’s mayor said. Protecting Ukraine’s borders is a “constant priority” as the country readies for all possible scenarios with Russia and its ally Belarus, Zelenskiy added. “Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus – is our constant priority,” he said in his nightly video address. “We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios.” Zelenskiy also issued a new appeal to western nations to provide Ukraine with effective air defences. Russia will reportedly deploy musicians to Ukraine’s frontlines in a bid to boost morale, according to its defence ministry. The “frontline creative brigade” will be tasked with maintaining “a high moral, political and psychological state [among] the participants of the special military operation,” Russian outlet RBC news cited the ministry as saying. UK defence officials said the new unit is in keeping with the historic use of “military music and organised entertainment” to boost morale as low morale continues to be a “significant vulnerability across much of the Russian force”. Iran’s foreign ministry has said it will not “seek permission from anyone” to expand relations with Russia, dismissing US concerns over a growing military partnership between Tehran and Moscow. Iran has been accused of supplying drones to Russia, allegedly used to attack Ukraine. CIA chief William Burns said the military cooperation between Iran and Russia “poses real threats” to US allies in the Middle East. Nasser Kanani, spokesperson for Iran’s foreign ministry, called the comments “baseless” adding that Tehran “acts independently in regulating its foreign relations and does not seek permission from anyone”. Veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger believes the time is approaching for a negotiated peace in Ukraine. “The time is approaching to build on the strategic changes which have already been accomplished and to integrate them into a new structure towards achieving peace through negotiation,” Kissinger wrote in The Spectator magazine. “A peace process should link Ukraine to Nato, h owever expressed. The alternative of neutrality is no longer meaningful,” he added. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak dismissed the comments as amounting to “appeasing the aggressor” and said there could be no deal involving ceding territory. “Any agreement with the devil – a bad peace at the expense of Ukrainian territories – will be a victory for Putin and a recipe for success for autocrats around the world,” he said in a statement on Telegram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/13/heatwaves-could-add-to-energy-problems-across-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-13T08:30:10Z","webTitle":"Weather tracker: heatwaves could add to energy problems across Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/13/heatwaves-could-add-to-energy-problems-across-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/13/heatwaves-could-add-to-energy-problems-across-europe","fields":{"headline":"Weather tracker: heatwaves could add to energy problems across Europe","bodyText":"The extreme heat affecting Iberia this week has led to temperatures peaking at over 40C in some parts of Spain over the past days – that’s 7-9C above the seasonal average in some locations like Andalucia. The hot and dry weather has worsened the drought issues across the region, with many water reservoirs recording extremely low levels of storage at the start of the summer season, following a very dry winter (especially January/February) and a very dry May too. Spain generates more than 10% of its electricity from hydropower plants, so this will have some serious implications for energy production and availability/prices. The dry and hot conditions are moving eastwards through the rest of this week and into the weekend, across north-western and central Europe, before reaching further north and east into eastern Europe through the weekend and into the following week. Temperatures are expected to reach into the 30s across many areas, peaking at between 7-10C above the seasonal normal in some locations. The heatwave will lead to a surge in energy demand for cooling across some parts of Europe, and will also increase the river water temperatures used for cooling nuclear power plants across the continent. In the past, France’s EDF had to halt some of their nuclear reactors due to the heat and the rising Rhone River temperatures, although this is more common in July and August rather than mid-June. On the other side of the Atlantic, since the beginning of June, large swathes of central and eastern US have experienced mostly seasonal conditions, with western parts of the American continent facing the hottest and driest conditions so far. However, a change is coming through this week as heat is building across the central plains and expanding eastwards, with this likely to lead to some unseasonably hot weather through the first half of this week with many temperature records being challenged. Later this week and into the weekend, a cold front will push west to east, bringing some relief to some parts of the states."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/14/ukraine-war-everything-we-know-on-day-19-of-the-russian-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-14T18:32:35Z","webTitle":"Ukraine war: everything we know on day 19 of the Russian invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/ukraine-war-everything-we-know-on-day-19-of-the-russian-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/14/ukraine-war-everything-we-know-on-day-19-of-the-russian-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine war: everything we know on day 19 of the Russian invasion","bodyText":"A Russian airstrike hit a residential building in Kyiv as Moscow’s forces stepped up their brutal campaign to capture Ukraine’s capital and other major cities. One person was found dead in the nine-storey apartment building, officials said, with three more people hospitalised as air raid sirens sounded in the capital and other cities hours before Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were set to resume talks. The Antonov aircraft plant in Kyiv was shelled by Russian forces, the Kyiv city administration said in an update on its official Telegram account. At least two people were killed and seven injured, it said. Ukrainian authorities have denied accusations by the Russians after a Ukrainian missile allegedly exploded in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk killing at least 20 civilians. Ukrainian military spokesman Leonid Matyukhin said the missile, that carried a shrapnel warhead, was in fact a Russian rocket. The Russian and Ukrainian claims cannot be independently verified. There are reports that Russian forces blew up explosives at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s parliament earlier said Russian troops planned to begin “disposal” of ammunition in front of the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear power station. At least nine people were reportedly killed and nine more wounded in an airstrike on a television tower in Ukraine’s northern Rivne region. “There are still people under the rubble,” governor Vitaliy Koval said in an online post, Reuters reports. Ninety children have been killed and more than 100 wounded in Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February, the Ukrainian general prosecutor’s office said. “The highest number of victims are in the Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kherson, Mykolayiv and Zhytomyr regions,” it said in a statement. A convoy of more than 160 cars departed from Mariupol today, local officials said, in what appeared to be the first successful attempt to evacuate civilians from the encircled Ukrainian city. After several days of failed attempts to deliver supplies to Mariupol and provide safe passage out for trapped civilians, the city council said a local ceasefire was holding and the convoy had left for the city of Zaporizhzhia. A close ally of Vladimir Putin has admitted Russia’s military operation in Ukraine has not gone as quickly as the Kremlin had wanted, Reuters reports. National Guard chief Viktor Zolotov blamed the slower-than-expected progress on what he said were far-right Ukrainian forces hiding behind civilians, an accusation repeatedly made by Russian officials. Russia has denied reports that it has asked China for military equipment, claiming it has sufficient military clout to fulfil all of its aims in Ukraine without any need for help from China. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russian troops could take “major population centres under full control” in Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/30/the-guardian-view-on-kherson-the-cost-of-war-in-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-30T18:09:57Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Kherson: the cost of war in Ukraine | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/30/the-guardian-view-on-kherson-the-cost-of-war-in-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/30/the-guardian-view-on-kherson-the-cost-of-war-in-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Kherson: the cost of war in Ukraine","bodyText":"Russia took the city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, little more than a week after launching its invasion on 24 February. It was the first major city to fall to Vladimir Putin’s forces, and remains the only regional capital to have done so. With the failure of the Russian plan for a lightning victory increasingly evident, and humiliating, the city’s capture was important for Moscow for symbolic as well as strategic reasons. Many of its 280,000 inhabitants remained not only angry but defiant, mounting protests in its centre. But the gruelling impact of Russian occupation has taken its toll. The protests were suppressed by troops. The crackdown on dissent has been ruthless and thorough. A Russian curriculum has been imposed in schools. So Monday’s declaration by a Ukrainian military official that a long-anticipated southern counterattack had begun was a striking moment six months into this war. Ukraine’s southern command declared that Russia had suffered heavy losses of personnel and equipment (while Russia’s defence ministry claimed that it had inflicted severe losses on the Ukrainians). Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, claimed that troops had broken through Russian defences in several areas near Kherson – yet was also keen to manage expectations, portraying a “slow operation to grind the enemy”. The extent of the pushback is far from clear. One Ukrainian official described “normal operations”, and some fighters have suggested that the attacks fall short of a full counteroffensive. Partisan attacks were already occurring. Despite the flow of arms from the US especially, Ukraine remains very short of weapons and personnel to attempt a major assault. Some wondered if trailing a counteroffensive so heavily in advance was designed to try to distract Russia from the east, where it has been advancing, albeit slowly. The US military said on Monday that there was an uptick in fighting around Kherson, but could not confirm whether an offensive had begun. The former head of MI6 Sir Alex Younger spoke not in military terms but of a “key psychological moment” when interviewed by the BBC, and talked not about place but time. Russian occupation is having an incremental effect not only on the wellbeing of civilians, but also on the city’s status. The Kremlin plans a referendum to create the pretext for bringing the region into Russia, despite minimal enthusiasm; Ukraine may hope to postpone the vote. In logistical terms, bitter winter conditions are also likely to entrench the military stalemate. But Sir Alex was pointing to Kyiv’s need to show that it can do more than resist the Russian advance; it can seize the initiative – thus shoring up the morale of its own population, as it faces a grim winter, and maintaining the support of western leaders, whose own voters are struggling with soaring energy costs. As he discussed the development, EU defence ministers meeting in Prague were expected to approve plans for a training facility for Ukrainian troops, but finance ministers remained divided over hitting Russia further. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis is growing. Unable to make swift military progress, Russia may have shifted focus towards formalising annexation and to economic punishment. Kyiv fears Russia could target its energy grid and turn off the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Some think that as many as 2 million Ukrainians could cross into Poland this winter. As hazy as the military situation remains, its brutal impact on civilians could not be clearer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/06/drax-agrees-to-extend-life-of-coal-fired-power-units-over-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-06T18:15:29Z","webTitle":"Drax agrees to extend life of coal-fired power units over winter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/06/drax-agrees-to-extend-life-of-coal-fired-power-units-over-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/06/drax-agrees-to-extend-life-of-coal-fired-power-units-over-winter","fields":{"headline":"Drax agrees to extend life of coal-fired power units over winter","bodyText":"Drax has agreed to extend the life of its coal-fired electricity generation units through this winter as the government scrambles to shore up Britain’s energy supplies. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said the operator of the Yorkshire power station had agreed to push its planned closure back by six months until March. The plant had been due to close its coal operations in late September as Drax attempts to reduce the carbon in its operations. The company has switched most of its operations towards biomass but it has two remaining coal units. Kwarteng has embarked on a push to secure electricity supplies for the winter after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine upended already squeezed energy markets. Drax said the units “will not generate commercially for the duration of the agreement and only operate if and when instructed to do so by National Grid”. Under the terms of the agreement, Drax will be paid a fee and compensated for costs. The company said its profits were now likely to be “slightly above the top of the range of analyst expectations”. Analysts had pencilled in profits of £584m to £635m. Kwarteng said on Wednesday: “With Russia cutting off gas to parts of Europe, this is a sensible precaution back home. As energy secretary I have a responsibility to ensure we have enough supply this winter.” The agreement, negotiated between National Grid and Drax, follows a similar move at EDF’s West Burton A plant at in Nottinghamshire. That plant will also stay in operation for a further six months. Talks over the future of a third coal-fired power station run by Uniper, which is facing financial strife in Germany, are expected to conclude in the next few weeks, sources close to the situation said. Kwarteng said: “We now have two coal plants available this winter. Negotiations ongoing with one more.” The government is also in discussions with the British Gas owner, Centrica, to reopen its Rough gas storage site in the North Sea, which was closed in 2017. The energy security bill, which aims to boost the production of domestic energy supplies, reached parliament on Wednesday. In the longer term, ministers hope to boost Britain’s capacity to produce energy from a string of sources including new nuclear power stations and windfarms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/10/north-korea-says-missile-tests-simulated-striking-south-with-tactical-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-10T02:38:46Z","webTitle":"North Korea says missile tests simulated striking South with tactical nuclear weapons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/10/north-korea-says-missile-tests-simulated-striking-south-with-tactical-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/10/north-korea-says-missile-tests-simulated-striking-south-with-tactical-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"headline":"North Korea says missile tests simulated striking South with tactical nuclear weapons","bodyText":"North Korea’s recent flurry of missile tests demonstrated its ability to carry out strikes with tactical nuclear weapons, its leader, Kim Jong-un, has said, adding that his forces were “completely ready to hit and destroy targets at any time from any location”. Kim, who last month said the North’s transformation into a nuclear power was “irreversible,” said the drills were “an obvious warning and clear demonstration” to the country’s enemies. The regime’s short-range tactical nuclear missiles would be unable to reach its nemesis – the US – but could theoretically be used against the South and Japan. In a report carried on Monday, the state news agency KCNA said that Kim had ordered the test launches in response to large-scale navy drills by South Korean and US forces. Tokyo and Washington recently resumed the exercises, including the deployment of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan to waters off the east coast of South Korea – a move that infuriated Pyongyang, where the drills are seen as a rehearsal for an invasion. In response, North Korea “decided to organise military drills under the simulation of an actual war,” KCNA reported. Army units involved in “the operation of tactical nukes, staged military drills from 25 September to 9 October in order to check and assess the war deterrent and nuclear counterattack capability of the country,” the report said, confirming that Kim had personally directed the exercises. Official photographs showed Kim at all of the missile launches and exercises, giving orders and posing with smiling soldiers. “They’re pursuing a tactical nuclear weapon for sure,” said US-based security analyst Ankit Panda. “I suspect they’ll gradually nuclearise many of their new short-range missiles, including the manoeuvring missiles.” The fact that North Korea has described all seven of its recent missile launches as being linked to “tactical nuclear operations units” is significant, he added, since the inventory includes everything from short-range and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, to a new short-range missile designed to be launched from a submarine. Kim, who has presided over dramatic improvements in missile and nuclear development despite years of UN sanctions, has long wanted to acquire tactical nuclear weapons – smaller, lighter weapons designed for battlefield use – and made it a top priority at a key party congress in January 2021. Last month, North Korea revised its nuclear laws to enable it to conduct preemptive nuclear strikes, including in response to conventional attacks. Kim guided exercises by the country’s nuclear tactical operation units over the past two weeks, involving ballistic missiles with mock nuclear warheads, KCNA said, adding that they were meant to deliver a strong deterrent message. “The effectiveness and practical combat capability of our nuclear combat force were fully demonstrated as it stands completely ready to hit and destroy targets at any time from any location,” KCNA quoted Kim as saying. “Even though the enemy continues to talk about dialogue and negotiations, we do not have anything to talk about nor do we feel the need to do so.” The various tests simulated targeting military command facilities, striking main ports, and neutralising airports in the South. Tactical nuclear weapons South Korean and US officials say there are signs North Korea could soon detonate a new nuclear device in underground tunnels at its Punggye-ri nuclear test site, which was officially closed in 2018. Analysts say putting small warheads on short-range missiles could represent a dangerous change in the way North Korea deploys and plans to use nuclear weapons. On 4 October, the North test-fired a ballistic missile farther than ever before, flying what it said was a new intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan for the first time since 2017. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said North Korea had “multiple motivations” for publicising the launches. “Kim Jong-un’s public appearance after a month-long absence provides a patriotic headline to mark (Monday’s) founding anniversary of the ruling Workers’ party,” Easley said. “Pyongyang has been concerned about military exercises by the US, South Korea and Japan, so to strengthen its self-proclaimed deterrent, it is making explicit the nuclear threat behind its recent missile launches,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2022/may/20/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-20T20:00:12Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/20/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/may/20/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A report referred to an employment tribunal ruling about “sexual harassment”.

Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, the second biggest in Europe, housing six of the country’s 15 reactors. In their letter to the IAEA, Russian officials insisted that Ukrainian staff at the plant were continuing to “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation”. However, the Ukrainian state enterprise running the country’s nuclear industry, Energoatom, accused the Russian military of “openly terrorizing employees of the station and residents of its satellite city Energodar”. Video footage shared on social media by a Ukrainian official showed crowds of Ukrainians forming a barrier between the Russian forces and the nuclear plant, blocking their advance. The interior ministry official, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a Facebook post: “Russian generals – change your minds! Do not create conditions for the new Chernobyl! Radiation knows no nationalities, one does not spare anyone! Go around the Energodar and Zaporizhzhya.” Ukraine has asked the IAEA to declare a 30km safe zone around Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants. Grossi told the IAEA board of governors meeting in Vienna: “It is of critical importance that the armed conflict and activities on the ground around Zaporizhihia nuclear power plant and any other of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities in no way interrupts or endangers the facilities or the people working at and around them.” The IAEA also said that a feed of radiation data from Zaporizhzhia had been interrupted on Tuesday and that Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate (SNRIU) was trying to find out the reason for the break and to restore the flow of data. Grossi also raised concern over a report from the SNRIU that since Russians took over the Chernobyl plant, site of the 1986 disaster in north western Ukraine near the Belarus border, the staff there had not been permitted to go home. The US deputy envoy to the IAEA, Louis Bono, said: “The Ukrainian staff at the site have not been allowed to leave and have been forced to work multiple shifts. This added stress on staff performing critical tasks further jeopardizes the safety and security of the site and the public.” In his remarks Grossi said: “It is of utmost importance that the staff working at [the Chernobyl plant] are able to do their job safely and effectively, and that their personal wellbeing is guaranteed by those who have taken control,” The remains of the reactor core which exploded in 1986 is buried under concrete at the site, and there are also spent fuel storage facilities and a large amount of radioactive dust in the topsoil of the surrounding area. The churning up of the soil by Russian military vehicles caused limited radiation spikes. In a statement, Energoatom said: “Being in the exclusion zone now and apparently not having the skills to ensure personal safety when working in radioactively contaminated areas, the invaders are exposed to significant external and internal radiation, which will undoubtedly manifest itself in the form of cancer.” On Sunday, the Ukrainian authorities said Russian missiles had struck the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in Kyiv. The day before, an electrical transformer in another waste facility in Kharkiv was damaged. In both cases there was no radioactive release, but the incidents highlighted the potential threat of ecological disaster from a war underway in a country with an extensive nuclear industry. The American Nuclear Society (ANS), an association of industry professionals, is seeking to send material support to Ukraine to help nuclear workers there. “The staff at Ukraine’s nuclear power plants must be able to fulfill their duties without interruption undue pressure or the fear of being killed or injured,” the ANS said in a statement. “Ukraine’s nuclear workers need their rest between shifts, access to their homes and a peace of mind that their loved ones are safe. The society’s president, Steven Nesbit, said he hoped that the Russian invaders were aware of the dangers of a nuclear accident. “All I can say is it’s hard to believe that they wouldn’t have a sensitivity to the issues here,” Nesbit said. “Russia and Vladimir Putin need to be taking all steps they can to avoid becoming even more of a pariah nation than they have become.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/26/are-bank-holidays-good-for-the-planet-we-ask-an-expert","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T14:00:31Z","webTitle":"Are bank holidays good for the planet?

We ask an expert","bodyText":"With the exception of Scotland, this Monday is the UK’s last bank holiday before Christmas. The UK gets eight days a year in comparison with the EU average of 12.8. But, beyond opportunities to relax, what do they mean for the planet? I spoke to Dénes Csala, who found that each bank holiday saves 100,000 tonnes of carbon. Your findings surprised me, especially when the bank holidays are such a popular time to fly abroad. Some are, though some are also family events, so people stay home. And when we looked at all the bank holidays, we found energy consumption dropped by about 10% overall, probably because the commute vanished. How did you get to 10%? We used statistics published by Entsoe-E – the EU’s energy watchdog. But what’s striking is, even though energy consumption drops by about 10%, we calculated that emissions could drop by up to 22%-25%. We use cleaner energy sources first, such as nuclear power. As we require more energy, we start to tap into other sources, like wind turbines. It’s only when we’re at peak energy usage that we start to use the sources with the highest emissions – such as natural gas. Plus there are big differences between summer and winter. In summer, we consume less. So from an emissions perspective, we’d be better off having more bank holidays in the winter? The numbers would suggest that. Winter is for hibernation! I know it, you know it, the bears know it. You mentioned the impact of commuting – does that mean hybrid working is good for the planet, too? I don’t think enough time has passed to make that judgment. From an energy consumption perspective, there may be a drop, but there are other considerations, such as how office buildings may be more efficient than houses. Are there energy-mindful things hybrid teams could be doing? Working in different slots to reduce peaks from commuting: so some people work from 8am to 4pm, others 9am to 5pm, and 10am to 6pm. How funny, I was just reading an article about circadian rhythms. Apparently we’re all on different body clocks and are most productive at different times of the day, so it’s quite mad that we’re forced to live on the same timetable. I think personalising the work week would have many gains. Take this idea of the four-day week: a three-day weekend sounds alluring but the best way might not actually be having Friday off for everyone, but an extra day off at different times. But it is a false dream to think a four-day work week will suddenly halve emissions. In Utah, a four-day week trial reduced energy use by 13%, but it was abandoned – the state government didn’t think it was worth it. As work dreams go, I like the utopia where machines do the drudgery so human work is only the fulfilling stuff – inventing and creating. Mind you, I’m not sure how energy-efficient those machines would be. That’s interesting – if we replaced human workers with robots, which would be more energy-efficient? You’d think the robots – but then you think about the energy that goes into manufacturing a product somewhere in Asia and putting it on a ship and, well, I’m not so sure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-184-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T00:37:58Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 184 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-184-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-184-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 184 of the invasion","bodyText":"Shelling temporarily disconnected the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from Ukraine’s grid. Fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country’s nuclear power firm, Energoatom, said. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the UN nuclear watchdog could travel to the Zaporizhzhia plant in the “coming days”. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, earlier said his team were “very, very close” to being able to go to the plant. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after the US president, Joe Biden, spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Biden congratulated him on the country’s 31st independence day, celebrated on Wednesday. Zelenskiy said he had “a great conversation” and thanked Biden for his “unwavering” support. It comes a day after Biden announced nearly $3bn in new military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment, the biggest tranche of US military aid to date. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month with no signs of abating. The Russian president’s decree appears to point to the country’s aim to replenish its military, which has been heavily damaged in Ukraine and has failed to achieve its objective to capture the capital, Kyiv. At least 25 people have been confirmed dead after a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian train station. Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday. The deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia. The Vatican’s Russia-Ukraine diplomacy suffered two setbacks on Thursday when the head of the Russian Orthodox church cancelled a meeting with Pope Francis and Ukraine summoned the papal ambassador to complain about Francis’ latest comments about the war. The pontiff upset Kyiv by including Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian nationalist TV Alexander Dugin killed by a car bomb on Sunday, as among the “innocents” who have been victimised by the “insanity of war.” Russia has accused Ukrainian intelligence in the bombing, which Ukraine denies.

Shares in the quoted electricity generators – the likes of Centrica, Drax and SSE – fell for about half an hour as the chancellor announced in the House of Commons a stiff-sounding windfall tax. Then prices rebounded – plus a bit – as the details of the scheme emerged to reveal that Jeremy Hunt had been far less severe than he could have been. “A very reasonable outcome,” commented Bernstein’s analysts, looking through the lens of companies and investors. You bet: while promising to raise £14bn from generators out to 2028, Hunt left several billion on the table. The first critical detail was the definition of generators’ “extraordinary” profits – the part to which the new 45% levy will apply. It references revenues above £75 per megawatt-hour, whereas investors were braced for a figure closer to £60. By the close of trading, the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 index was British Gas owner Centrica, which made its best decision in years when it decided to retain, rather try to flog, its 20% stake in the UK’s existing fleet of nuclear power stations last year. Those ageing nuclear plants, with largely fixed costs, are a supremely lucrative asset to own while sky-high gas prices are dictating the wholesale price of electricity. Therein lies the unanswerable case for a levy on generators to go alongside the one on North Sea producers: nuclear, renewables and biomass firms (or those not on contracts-for-difference arrangements) are enjoying massively outsized returns versus their investment risk thanks to a “made-in-Russia energy crisis”, as Hunt put it. And the second important detail was that gas-fired power stations have been excluded from the levy. Consider that a victory for SSE and others with significant gas-fired portfolios. Their plea that riskier “flexible” generating capacity should be spared has prevailed, even though gas-fired stations are themselves enjoying a surge in profit margins that could equally be called extraordinary. Scottish Power, which sold its stations to concentrate on wind and solar in 2018 to Drax (which itself sold them on 2020), grumbled about “a recession made by gas, but a recovery to be paid for by renewables”. It’s a fair point. On the plus side, Hunt has at least provided clarity. After six months of indecision in government, that was the minimum requirement, as argued here yesterday. The generators now know the rules. But let’s be clear: the windfall formula is tame. What is going on with Bulb? There was one hell of a footnote in the Office for Budget Responsibility’s analysis: “The total cost of the Bulb Energy bailout has reached £6.5bn”. Since the upper end of outsiders’ estimates was previously £4bn, the new figure requires an explanation, which the OBR unfortunately did not provide fully. One must assume the government’s refusal to allow a nationalised Bulb to run a hedging programme on energy purchases is to blame. Bulb was left to buy for customers at spot prices in a rising market because the Treasury regards hedging instruments as too risky – or so Kwasi Kwarteng, when business secretary, said. If so, the Treasury’s stance was ridiculous. All energy suppliers hedge; it is how the industry works. The National Audit Office is having a look at the less than transparent terms of the pending sale of Bulb to Octopus Energy. It should extend its inquiry to the government’s entire oversight of Bulb over the past 12 months. Nationalisation was never going to be costless, but £6.5bn – if that is a cash cost to the public purse – is scandalous. You could buy Centrica (market cap £5.1bn) for less. High street reprieve On business rates in England, Hunt did well. He pulled on all the main levers to give high streets some help: he froze the multiplier; he allowed firms with lower bills from property revaluations to enjoy the full benefit immediately by scrapping transitional caps; and he extended and increased relief for retail, hospitality and leisure firms. The net effect will be a freeze, more or less, in government receipts from business rates next year. Within that overall picture, the retail sector is projected to pay 20% less, while large distribution warehouses are expected to pay 27% more. That is viewed as the alternative to an online sales tax. Within the limitations of the complex business rates system, Hunt went as far he reasonably could. A few high street businesses may survive as a result. Yet Labour’s prescription for this clunky property-based charge still feels better: scrap it and design something more suited to the 21st century. • This article was amended on 1 December 2022. An earlier version said that Drax would benefit from the exclusion of gas-fired assets from the windfall tax; in fact, the company sold its gas-fired portfolio in 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/05/putin-erdogan-meet-secretive-talks-sochi-russia-turkey-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T15:09:41Z","webTitle":"Putin and Erdoğan meet for secretive talks in Sochi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/putin-erdogan-meet-secretive-talks-sochi-russia-turkey-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/05/putin-erdogan-meet-secretive-talks-sochi-russia-turkey-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Putin and Erdoğan meet for secretive talks in Sochi","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has met Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for talks expected to focus on Russia’s war in Ukraine and that are being rumoured to include Kremlin efforts to circumvent western sanctions. Putin welcomed the Turkish president to Sochi, a resort city on the Black Sea, by thanking him for his help in securing an international deal that resumed exports of grain from Ukraine that had been disrupted by the Kremlin war machine – as well as Russian foodstuffs and fertilisers – to world markets. The deal ended a standoff that had threatened a global food crisis, as Ukraine and Russia are some of the world’s largest exporters of grain. Another three ships carrying almost 60,000 tonnes of grain between them departed Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Friday and are on their way to Britain, Ireland and Turkey respectively. “This is a very pressing problem for many countries, first and foremost, the developing ones that are on the brink of big problems with food and fertiliser supply. The decisions made with your direct participation are very important for all these countries,” Putin told Erdoğan as their closed-door meetings began. But reports have warned that the meeting may serve an ulterior motive. A Ukrainian government report described by the Washington Post said Putin would seek Russian stakes in Turkish oil refineries, terminals and reservoirs in order to help disguise the origin of Russian oil exports ahead of a planned EU oil embargo. The newspaper also reported that Russia could seek correspondent accounts for large Russian banks to circumvent financial sanctions. The Russian government did not confirm the report and there was no indication that Turkey would entertain the proposals, which would put the Nato member at considerable risk of secondary sanctions. At least publicly, economic cooperation led the agenda at the talks. Putin noted that the TurkStream pipeline had continued operating “smoothly … in contrast to every other route supplying our hydrocarbons”. Erdoğan brought up plans for a nuclear power plant to be built with Russian help. But the tensions between the two countries and their leaders remain considerable. Turkey is a member of Nato, has sold advanced weaponry such as Bayraktar drones to Ukraine, and is at odds with Russia over the future of Syria, where the Kremlin has backed Bashar al-Assad while Turkey has sought to gain influence in the country’s north. There were other indications that the two leaders planned to discuss more than just their economic agenda. Before the meeting began, Russian journalists noted that Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader who has sent forces under his command to both Syria and Ukraine, was in attendance. The two men are expected to speak behind closed doors over a late lunch. They are not expected to give a joint statement following the summit. The Russian deputy prime minister Alexander Novak is expected to address the press after the summit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/oct/27/dining-across-the-divide-he-supports-the-royal-family-but-im-a-republican-id-get-rid-of-all-of-them","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T11:30:28Z","webTitle":"Dining across the divide: ‘He supports the royal family, but I’m a republican – I’d get rid of all of them’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/oct/27/dining-across-the-divide-he-supports-the-royal-family-but-im-a-republican-id-get-rid-of-all-of-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/oct/27/dining-across-the-divide-he-supports-the-royal-family-but-im-a-republican-id-get-rid-of-all-of-them","fields":{"headline":"Dining across the divide: ‘He supports the royal family, but I’m a republican – I’d get rid of all of them’","bodyText":"Julie, 53, Oxfordshire Occupation Inclusion manager in scientific research Voting record Labour and Lib Dem in the past.

Julie Once we settled down, and he stopped being nervous, he was very sweet. He cares deeply about fairness in the workplace, and he’s involved in diversity and inclusion groups. He talked for about 40 minutes without asking me what I did – and I’m a diversity and inclusion manager. The big beef Julie He supports the royal family, but immediately said, “not Andrew”. He felt the younger royals were more accessible, and that the Queen hadn’t been particularly accessible until Diana came along. But I’m a republican – I’d get rid of all of them. I said something tongue in cheek: that I’d force them to sell all their inherited land and property to the National Trust, then use the profit to make reparations for slavery. It’s never going to happen. I just thought I’d see what he said. His jaw dropped. I think it was a step too far. Mark I’ve got no strong feelings one way or the other; it’s not a big thing for me. I can’t think of a good alternative to the royal family. I wouldn’t be too keen on President Cameron or President Blair or President Boris. Julie’s line was that the prime minister is quite presidential anyway so it wouldn’t make much difference. Julie He said: “At least the monarch has the final say on things,” and I said: “When do they ever use the final say?” Mark We talked about Barbados, which has become a republic. My argument was that they should have had a referendum before the government made a decision. Julie’s was that because the ruling party put it in their manifesto, people would have already known, so they didn’t need one. Julie Barbados’s prime minister Mia Mottley’s Labour party won every seat – to me that says the voters wanted to distance themselves from British rule. Sharing plate Mark I think we should reopen a couple of coalmines for backup. My concern is that we haven’t got enough energy to support the country as it is. We should invest in renewables, of course, but it’s not going to supply us with everything we need. Julie I said: “We could if we had any miners, but I suspect that would be quite expensive, retraining people who left generations ago.” I don’t agree with fossil fuels, obviously. It might be economical in the short term, but that’s because the current policy hasn’t invested enough in renewables. Mark The country imports wood pellets from North America, which basically get driven on a lorry to the coast and sailed to Yorkshire. That’s not environmentally friendly. She was quite aghast at the wood pellets. She’s more into building up nuclear power. I don’t think we should be dependent on world energy prices. We’re either going to have to carry on buying wood pellets, relying on Russian energy or cut the power off. The country’s going to have to make a choice. For afters Mark Are the police institutionally sexist? My argument was that, over time, the workforce changes and you get a younger and more culturally aware intake as people rise up to management.

Even if we did not get this approval … we would still transfer our tanks together with others to Ukraine”, Morawiecki told reporters. German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock’s comment on Sunday, that her country would not “stand in the way” of Poland sending Leopard tanks to Ukraine, is causing some confusion in Berlin. It remains unclear whether her remarks are indicative of a shift in the government’s position. Baerbock did not repeat her comment when pressed on the matter on Monday morning. “It’s important that we as an international community do everything to defend Ukraine, so that Ukraine wins”, she told press at a meeting of the EU’s foreign affairs council in Brussels. “Because if it loses Ukraine will cease to exist”. German chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday promised that Germany will “continue to support Ukraine – for as long and as comprehensively as necessary”, adding: “Together, as Europeans – in defence of our European peace project.” Germany’s new defence minister, Boris Pistorius, plans to visit Ukraine soon, he told a German newspaper. German government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said “To this hour we have not received a request.” Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said during his visit to South Africa on Monday that Ukraine was rejecting peace talks and the longer this continued, the harder it would be to resolve the conflict. Lavrov met South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, in a trip some opposition parties and the small Ukrainian community in South Africa have condemned as insensitive. The South African military is set to host a joint military exercise with Russia and China on its east coast on 17-27 February. 18 people injured as a result of last weekend’s rocket attack on a high-rise building in Dnipro remain in hospital, including one child. Ukraine state broadcaster reports “There are no serious patients among these patients, all of them were transferred from intensive care units to general departments.” Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of Sumy in Ukraine’s north-east, has said that an apartment building and railway infrastructure has been hit by Russian fire in Vorozhba. There were no details of casualties. The top Moscow-installed official in the Russian-occupied parts of the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine said late on Sunday that he had visited the town of Soledar, which Russia claimed to have captured earlier this month. Denis Pushilin published a short video on the Telegram messaging app that showed him driving and walking amid desolate areas and destroyed buildings. The Guardian was not able to independently verify when and where the video was taken. On 11 January, the private Russian military group Wagner said it had captured Soledar. Ukraine has never publicly said that the town was taken by Russian forces. Russia claimed to have made advances in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region. After months of stalemate in the south-eastern region, Moscow-installed officials say the front is now “mobile” while the Ukrainian army reported that 15 settlements had come under artillery fire. “During offensive operations in the direction of Zaporizhzhia, units of the eastern military district took up more advantageous ground and positions,” the defence ministry said on Sunday. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that Russian forces claim to have destroyed a large Ukrainian ammunition depot in the Kherson region. Russian secret service the SVR has claimed – without presenting evidence –that Ukraine is storing weapons and ammunition supplied by the west on the territory of nuclear power plants. European Council president Charles Michel has urged the bloc’s national leaders to push forward with talks on using $300bn-worth of confiscated Russian central bank assets for the reconstruction of Ukraine, the Financial Times reports. Michael said he wanted to explore the idea of managing the Russian central bank’s frozen assets to generate profits, which could then be earmarked for reconstruction efforts. Russia has said it is downgrading diplomatic relations with the Nato member Estonia, accusing Tallinn of “total Russophobia”. The Russian foreign ministry said it had told the Estonian envoy he must leave next month, and both countries would be represented in each other’s capitals by an interim charge d’affaires instead of an ambassador. Latvia will downgrade its diplomatic ties with Russia and inform its Russian ambassador to leave the country by 24 February. Russia said on Monday that no new date had been set for talks with the US on the New Start nuclear arms treaty, accusing the US of ramping up tensions between the two sides. A former commander with the Russian mercenary Wagner Group who sought asylum in Norway has been told he will be deported, according to a Russian rights group. Andrey Medvedev, 26, crossed the border into Norway near the Pasvikdalen valley earlier this month, where he was arrested and detained by border guards. Medvedev’s lawyer has dismissed the claim, saying “the risk of him being deported? It is zero.” Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson made a surprise visit to Ukraine, where he said that it was “the moment to double down and to give the Ukrainians all the tools they need to finish the job”. Downing Street said Rishi Sunak is “supportive” of Boris Johnson’s visit, despite warnings that it would undermine the current prime minister’s authority. Johnson’s visits to Ukraine have often coincided with moments of domestic crisis, and he is currently under pressure over his financial relationship with BBC chairman Richard Sharp. French president Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday he does not rule out the possibility of sending Leclerc tanks to Ukraine. “As for the Leclercs, I have asked the defence ministry to work on it. Nothing is excluded,” he said while speaking at a summit with German chancellor Scholz. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed Ukraine will not tolerate corruption and promised forthcoming key decisions on uprooting it this week. “I want this to be clear: there will be no return to what used to be in the past, to the way various people close to state institutions or those who spent their entire lives chasing a chair used to live,” he said in his nightly video address. The EU has made anti-corruption reforms one of its key requirements for Ukraine’s membership to the bloc, after granting Kyiv candidate status last year. Norway’s army chief has estimated 180,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in over the course of the conflict, while the figure for the Ukrainians is 100,000 military casualties and 30,000 dead civilians. Norwegian chief of defence Eirik Kristoffersen gave the figures in an interview with TV2, without specifying how the numbers were calculated. The figures cannot be independently verified."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/07/mother-who-sent-son-11-on-train-out-of-ukraine-alone-thanks-slovaks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-07T20:05:49Z","webTitle":"‘Hero’: Slovaks hail boy, 11, who travelled 700 miles alone from Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/mother-who-sent-son-11-on-train-out-of-ukraine-alone-thanks-slovaks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/07/mother-who-sent-son-11-on-train-out-of-ukraine-alone-thanks-slovaks","fields":{"headline":"‘Hero’: Slovaks hail boy, 11, who travelled 700 miles alone from Ukraine","bodyText":"The mother of an 11-year-old boy from Ukraine who travelled for nearly 700 miles to Slovakia with just a plastic bag, a passport and a telephone number written on his hand has spoken of her relief at her son’s safe escape from Russian bombs. Yulia Pisetskaya said she had put her son on a train to Slovakia from Zaporizhzhia, close to the nuclear plant that came under attack from Russian forces last week, out of desperation. She had been unable to leave with him from south-east Ukraine because she was unwell and needed to look after her disabled mother. Slovakian border guards looked after the boy, who has not been named, on his arrival, according to the police, who have described him as a “hero”. He had the phone number of relatives in the Slovakian capital, Bratislava, written on his hand. The authorities were able to track them down and they have since taken him into their care. “I am very grateful that they saved the life of my child,” Pisetskaya said in a video message posted on Facebook on Sunday. “In your small country, there are people with big hearts.” She added: “I am a widow and I have more children. I want to thank the Slovak customs and volunteers who took care of my son and helped him cross the border. I am grateful you have saved my child’s life. Next to my town is a nuclear power plant that the Russians are shooting at. I couldn’t leave my mother – she can’t move on her own.” The Slovakian interior ministry said on Facebook that the boy “won everybody’s hearts with his smile, fearlessness and determination, worthy of a real hero”. They said the authorities had “kept him warm and provided him with food and drink, which they packed for his next trip”. Officials added: “Thanks to the number on his hand and a piece of paper in his waist, he managed to contact his loved ones, who came for him later, and the whole story ended well.” “He came all alone from Zaporizhzhia because his parents had to stay in Ukraine,” police spokesperson Denisa Bardyova told AFP. “The boy was cared for by many, be it policemen, soldiers, customs officers or volunteers and various religious or civil organisations.” Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia site, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which creates around 20% of Ukraine’s electricity, in the early hours of Friday. They have since taken control of the facility. • The headline of this article was amended on 8 March 2022 to render the noun as Slovaks, rather than “Slovakians”, in accordance with our style guidance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-364-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-22T16:14:58Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 364 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-364-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-364-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 364 of the invasion","bodyText":"China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, has met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, as China and Russia reaffirmed their close bilateral relationship just days before the first anniversary of the start of the Ukraine war. In brief televised remarks, Wang said China and Russia were ready to deepen their strategic cooperation. Putin said that “Russian-Chinese relations were proceeding as planned” and talked of reaching “new milestones” in areas such as bilateral trade. Putin said the two countries had “ongoing cooperation” in international affairs and expressed Russia’s gratitude to China. Earlier on Wednesday, Wang met Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, where he said he expected to reach a “new consensus” on advancing the relationship between the two allies. Xi Jinping, China’s president, is expected to visit Putin in Russia in the coming months, although an exact date has not been announced. Joe Biden has been meeting the leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a collection of nations on the most eastern parts of the Nato alliance and closest to Russia. The alliance includes Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Speaking ahead of talks Biden said it was “absolutely clear” that the US would defend “literally every inch of Nato”. Ukraine will ask Turkey and the UN this week to start talks to roll over the Black Sea grain deal, seeking an extension of at least one year that would include the ports of Mykolaiv, a senior Ukrainian official said. Yuriy Vaskov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of restoration, also said he wanted the ports of Mykolaiv included in the deal, and that Russia’s current occupation of the Kinburn spit was an obstacle. The spit of land overlooks the route that ships would use to sail from Mykolaiv’s ports into the Black Sea. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has urged member states to speed up delivery of ammunition from their stocks to Ukraine “as a matter or urgency”. Building on comments at the Munich security conference over the weekend and at Nato headquarters on Tuesday, Borrell said the EU was ”looking into the question of joint procurement” of ammunition and “how to ramp up the production capacity of the European defence industry”. A group of 10 EU member states has called for stronger action to stop Russia sourcing military parts through front companies in neighbouring countries and evading western sanctions. The 10 countries, which include France, Germany, Italy and the Baltic states, write that “2023 must be the year of success in countering circumvention”, warning that public support and international legitimacy of sanctions could wane if they are deemed ineffective. EU countries on Wednesday failed to agree on a new set of sanctions against Russia meant to be in place for the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, four diplomatic sources in Brussels have told Reuters. Russia on Wednesday expressed “deep concern” over the UN’s behaviour regarding the rotation of staff at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. In a statement, Russia’s foreign ministry said the UN nuclear body was “disrupting” the scheduled changeover of IAEA staff stationed at the plant, which is occupied by Russian forces. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv region, reported that two people were injured in Russian strikes on the city of Kharkiv on Wednesday morning. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has said a shopping mall has been struck by Ukrainian fire in the Russian town of Shebekino, severely injuring one person. Pope Francis, speaking two days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, on Wednesday called for a ceasefire and peace negotiations, saying no victory could be “built on ruins”. The International Federation of Journalists said on Wednesday it had suspended the membership of Russia’s main journalism trade union after it established branches in occupied regions of Ukraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, plans to attend in person a Nato summit taking place in Vilnius in July, Ukraine’s ambassador to Lithuania told local newswire BNS. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports that in an unspecified number of regions in Russia, some commercial radio stations broadcast air raid alerts as a result of a cyber-attack. Russia’s flagship frigate equipped with new generation hypersonic cruise missiles has arrived in the South African port of Richards Bay for exercises that will include China. Belgium has said it is investigating a Russian “spy ship” detected in the North Sea around mid-November last year. Vincent Van Quickenborne, the Belgian justice and North Sea minister, said in a statement headlined “Russian spy ship off our coast in November”. It comes after the Dutch military intelligence agency MIVD said Russia had been attempting to gain intelligence to sabotage critical infrastructure in the Dutch part of the North Sea. Speaking before a crowd of thousands in the gardens of Warsaw’s Royal Castle on Tuesday, Joe Biden hailed the resilience of Ukraine’s people and the benevolence of Poland and other western allies in helping fend off the Russian invasion. The US president said the attack on Ukraine would never be a victory for Russia, and said new sanctions against Russia will be announced this week. India does not want the G20 nations to discuss additional sanctions on Russia during its one-year presidency of the bloc, according to officials. The foreign ministers of the G7 on Tuesday said their countries would continue to impose economic costs on Russia and urged the broader international community to reject what they described as Moscow’s “brutal expansionism”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, gave a long televised national address to the joint houses of the Russian parliament on Tuesday, in which he blamed the west for starting the war in Ukraine and promised a new fund to help those who had lost loved ones in what he referred to as Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. Putin also announced the suspension of Russia’s participation in the New Start (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). The foreign ministry later said Moscow intended to continue abiding by the restrictions outlined in the treaty on the number of warheads it could have deployed. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he regretted Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start bilateral nuclear arms control treaty and urged Moscow to reconsider. Spain plans to send six 2A4 Leopard tanks to Ukraine, defence minister Margarita Robles told lawmakers. “We are repairing right now six Leopard 2A4 vehicles … with the possibility – if needed and if our allies request it – of increasing that number,” Robles said. Women in Ukraine are increasingly vulnerable to sexual violence 12 months after Russia invaded the country, with reports of abuse on the rise, according to a humanitarian organisation in the country. Women fleeing bombed houses and their home towns are reporting attacks in the home and communal shelters, said Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine country director for the International Rescue Committee. Nato must “seriously plan” for the likely future reality of a Russian-controlled Belarus, the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has warned. Vladimir Putin will “very likely secure significant gains in restoring Russian suzerainty over Belarus” and use it as a launch pad to further threaten Ukraine and Nato’s eastern flank, regardless of the outcome of his invasion of Ukraine, the ISW said in its latest update on the war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/apr/14/japanese-regulator-bans-restart-tepco-nuclear-plant-over-safety-breaches","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-14T07:42:18Z","webTitle":"Japanese regulator bans restart at nuclear plant over safety breaches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/14/japanese-regulator-bans-restart-tepco-nuclear-plant-over-safety-breaches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/apr/14/japanese-regulator-bans-restart-tepco-nuclear-plant-over-safety-breaches","fields":{"headline":"Japanese regulator bans restart at nuclear plant over safety breaches","bodyText":"The operator of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant has been prevented from restarting its only operable atomic facility after a series of safety breaches, dealing a significant blow to Japanese attempts to resume nuclear power generation. Japan’s nuclear regulator is to issue a “corrective action order” on Wednesday that would ban Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) from transporting new uranium fuel to its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant in Niigata prefecture or loading fuel rods into its reactors. The move in effect prevents Tepco from restarting the facility’s seven reactors, which it hopes would turn around its finances a decade after one of its two plants in Fukushima suffered a triple meltdown. Tepco had hoped to bring two of seven reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa – the world’s biggest nuclear power plant with a capacity of 8,212 megawatts – back online to cut its operating costs by more than $800m (£580m) a year. In March, however, it was heavily criticised after a series of safety and security breaches came to light, including an unauthorised employee accessing sensitive areas of the facility and a failure to protect nuclear materials. Media reports said Wednesday’s decision was the first time the nuclear regulation authority – which was formed after the March 2011 disaster – had in effect banned a utility from operating a nuclear power plant. Tepco has not commented on the move, but its shares fell by almost 4% in afternoon trading in Tokyo. The company has until late September to submit a report to regulators outlining improvements in the way it handles nuclear materials. The agency will assess the changes before possibly removing the corrective order, a process that could take at least a year. Tepco has said it can save $827m in fuel costs annually by restarting Kashiwazaki-Kariwa’s No 6 and 7 reactors, which have been offline since at least 2012. When all seven of its reactors are in operation, the plant can generate enough power for 16m households. Tepco faces an enormous bill for decommissioning costs and compensation claims by residents living near the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi plant. The regulator’s decision came a day after the government announced that Tepco would release more than 1m tonnes of contaminated water from Fukushima Daiichi into the Pacific Ocean, prompting an angry response from local fishers and neighbouring countries. On Wednesday, South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, instructed his country’s officials to look into ways to refer Japan’s move to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, including filing for an injunction.

In a short video clip on his Telegram channel, Zelenskiy thanked serving Ukrainian troops for liberating Lyman. “As of 1230 [Kyiv] local time Lyman is completely cleared,” he said, adding: “Glory to Ukraine.” Earlier the Ukrainian president said his army would continue its offensive in the south and east and would “return back” all of the territory occupied by Russia, including Crimea. He suggested Russian generals were now “biting each other” after a series of embarrassing setbacks. Their loss of Lyman four months after Russian servicemen seized the city in the Donetsk oblast amounts to a humiliating moment for Vladimir Putin. On Friday, in a move rejected by the international community, he annexed Donetsk together with three other Ukrainian regions, and said they were a part of Russia “for ever”. Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s armed forces would continue to advance. He predicted more “mismatches” between Putin’s rhetoric and the reality on the battlefield. Reports suggested Ukrainian troops were pushing forward from Lyman towards the cities of Svatove and Kreminna. In Lyman, Ukrainian soldiers celebrated their victory. They reclaimed the police station and burned a Russian tricolour in a courtyard. One posted a jubilant video outside the local office of Denis Pushilin, the Kremlin-appointed head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, or DNR. Pushilin was one of four pro-Russian “leaders” who attended a ceremony in Moscow on Friday where an annexation treaty was signed, with Russia’s political elite looking on. Putin promised to use “all means” to defend the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions – an apparent threat to use nuclear weapons. It was unclear how many Russians were killed during their chaotic retreat from Lyman. Video showed burned-out vehicles, personal belongings and dead soldiers strewn along a forest road. Ukrainian forces recovered at least one T-72 tank which had suffered minor damage. In an intelligence briefing, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said Russia’s forces “probably suffered heavy casualties” as they left the city. Lyman was important because it “commands a key road crossing over the Siversky Donetsk River behind which Russia has been trying to consolidate its defences,” it added. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said Ukraine’s counter-offensive in the Donbas region would carry on. “In the near future we are waiting for the start of a large-scale process of de-occupation in Luhansk oblast,” he said. Local collaborators were “panicking”, he added. Ukraine also claimed to have liberated a village in the south of the country, where its troops have been pressing on Russian positions around the city of Kherson. Overnight they seized the village of Zolotaya Balka, next to the Dnipro River. A video shows a local resident posing with a soldier waving a Ukrainian flag. Social media channels in Kherson reported that Ukrainian troops had also liberated the “melon” – a concrete sign celebrating the region’s most famous fruit. The melon sculpture marked the administrative border. Next to it were abandoned Russian foxholes and ammunition cases. Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces had destroyed seven Ukrainian artillery and missile depots in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and Donetsk provinces. It said the guidance radar for a S-300 air defence missile system had also been destroyed near Nova Kaluha in the Kherson region, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, after a day of silence Moscow confirmed that it had “temporarily detained” the head of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which it has occupied since March. A Russian patrol abducted Ihor Murashov on Friday afternoon while he was on his way to work. Russia is trying to transfer the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Russian energy firm Rosatom, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, Petro Kotin, has told the BBC. It is reportedly compelling employees who live in the city of Enerhodar to sign Russian contracts. The International Atomic Energy Agency called on Russia to free Murashov. His detention posed a threat to safety and security, it said. “IAEA director general Rafael Grossi expressed the hope that Mr Murashov will return to his family safely and promptly and will be able to resume his important functions at the plant,” the agency tweeted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/feb/25/how-can-europe-wean-itself-off-russian-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-25T18:41:52Z","webTitle":"How can Europe wean itself off Russian gas?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/how-can-europe-wean-itself-off-russian-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/feb/25/how-can-europe-wean-itself-off-russian-gas","fields":{"headline":"How can Europe wean itself off Russian gas?","bodyText":"As Boris Johnson told parliament that Europe must wean itself off Russian gas – to loosen Vladimir Putin’s “grip on western politics” – the Nikolay Zubov tanker was making its way back from British waters to the port of Sabetta, in northern Siberia. The 300m-long vessel had recently dropped off a consignment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the Isle of Grain terminal, in the Thames Estuary, operated by the National Grid. Steaming north under a Cypriot “flag of convenience”, it charted a course for Russia’s Arctic coast, near the vast $27bn (£20bn) Yamal gas facility, personally inaugurated by Putin in 2017. Britain gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia, either flowing through subsea interconnector pipelines or arriving by boat at the Isle of Grain and two further LNG facilities at Milford Haven, South Wales. In the EU, whose gas market is so intermeshed with Britain’s that it effectively determines the prices paid by UK end users, the picture is very different. Russia exports between 150bn and 190bn cubic metres of gas to Europe each year, typically fulfilling 30-40% of demand across the continent. It accounts for 65% of imports into Europe’s economic powerhouse Germany and 100% for countries such as Latvia and Czech Republic. The obstacles to replacing Russian supplies are logistical, financial and political. So, if Europe – and by extension the UK – want to reduce their reliance on Putin’s pumps, what are the options and how feasible are they, particularly in the short term? Liquefied natural gas LNG is super-chilled gas, condensed into liquid form and transported by ship and “regasified” at specialist terminals. Ports including Milford Haven and Grain – Europe’s biggest LNG terminal – take regular shipments. In 2020, Russian LNG accounted for 3% of total UK gas supply and, so far at least, there is no sign of shipments being affected by sanctions. European ports including Montoir-de-Bretagne in France, Zeebrugge in Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands have also welcomed Siberian visitors of late. Figures provided by Argus show that Russia has supplied 16% of Europe’s LNG since February 2020. But Russia doesn’t come close to being one of the biggest LNG exporters, a list headed by the US, Qatar and Australia. Qatar is reportedly willing to increase LNG exports to Europe and, even now, shipments of LNG from the US are moored off Milford Haven, at the South Hook and Dragon terminals. On paper, Europe has the capacity to import an extra 147bn cubic metres of LNG a year, according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie, enough to replace Russian pipeline gas entirely. But Wood Mackenzie’s European gas analyst Graham Freedman said the switch would take “at least a decade” in practice, not least due to a lack of onward infrastructure in the right place. Germany, Europe’s biggest gas market, has no LNG import terminals. Even a temporary switch would be hugely expensive. Tom Marzec-Manser, lead European gas analyst at energy consultancy ICIS, pointed out that LNG production is limited and consignments go to the highest bidder. European countries already wrestling with sky-high prices would have to outbid increasingly gas-hungry Asian economies. “It’s an incredibly expensive short-term gap filler,” he said. Alternative pipelines Britain and Norway’s North Sea fields, not to mention onshore resources in the Netherlands, contain sizeable reserves but scope for upping the flow is limited. Marzec-Manser said Norwegian state energy firm Equinor has raised production but there’s “not much more they can do”. UK North Sea output is already on the decline, with limited headroom for a short-term increase. The Netherland’s’ vast Groningen field is an option in theory but probably not in practice, say analysts at Jefferies. It could provide 13bn cubic metres, equivalent to 9% of Russian supply. But the Dutch government is winding down production after drilling was found to be causing earthquakes. Reversing that decision looks politically unpalatable. Nuclear power or coal Nuclear power reduces reliance on gas for electricity and the UK generates up to 20% of its power that way. While much of the fleet is due to be retired by 2025, the government has thrown its weight behind rebuilding that capacity. But doing so takes time and does little to replace gas in cooking or heating homes. France gets 70% of its power from nuclear energy, affording it much more protection from volatile gas prices. But Germany announced its withdrawal from nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and in 2019 said it would pull the plug on coal-fired plants. Those decisions have left it more dependent than most major economies on Russian gas. In practice, Germany is unlikely to change its mind on decommissioning nuclear power stations. Given the climate crisis, few European countries are minded to turn back to coal. Fracking The UK government ordered a moratorium on all new fracking wells in 2019 but the gas price crisis has brought advocates out of the woodwork. They include Lord Frost – who presided over the UK’s Brexit negotiations – and Viscount Ridley, who chaired Northern Rock when it collapsed. The idea is that the UK could mimic the shale gas revolution that has transformed the US into a net energy exporter. Experts say otherwise – that fracking the way out of the Ukraine crisis doesn’t make geological, logistical, economic or political sense. Michael Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick Business School, points out that the UK’s reserves are harder to tap geologically than those in the US. Unlike the US, potential sites are surrounded by densely populated areas that are governed by strict planning laws and populated by people who don’t actually support fracking, making it politically impossible. Concerns about water and noise pollution persist and even if those were overcome, fracking would have vanishingly little impact on European wholesale prices, while also taking years to develop. “By the time we did it, we probably wouldn’t need the gas,” said Bradshaw. Renewables and home insulation Ultimately, renewable energy and decreased demand, by improving home energy efficiency through better insulation, offers the most obvious long-term solution. However, this depends on major investment and improvement in technologies such as battery storage, which makes up for the intermittency in supply from technologies such as wind power. Marzec-Manser said that the Ukraine crisis might well motivate Europe to go hell for leather for a renewable future but that it is already moving faster than any other part of the world. “It’s like trying to move into sixth gear when your car only has five gears,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jun/24/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-121-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-24T14:07:47Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 121 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-121-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jun/24/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-121-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 121 of the invasion","bodyText":"The last Ukrainian forces fighting in the heavily contested eastern city of Sievierodonetsk have been ordered to withdraw in order to avoid being encircled, as fears grow that the neighbouring city of Lysychansk could also fall to Russia within days. The anticipated loss of Sievierodonetsk is the latest battlefield reverse for Kyiv after its defeat in the port city of Mariupol. According to some estimates about 12,000 civilians remain in Sievierodonetsk, out of a prewar population of 160,000. All three bridges offering escape routes west over the Siverskyi Donets River to the twin city of Lysychansk have been destroyed in fighting, and the mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, says the humanitarian situation is critical. The Luhansk governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on Friday: “The situation right now is as such that staying at these destroyed positions just for the sake of being there doesn’t make sense.” He said Ukrainian forces had “received the order to retreat to new positions and continue fighting there”, but did not give further details. Russians were also advancing toward Lysychansk from Zolote and Toshkivka, and Russian reconnaissance units had been conducting forays on the city edges but were driven out by its defenders, he added. An official in the Russian-installed administration of Ukraine’s occupied Kherson region was killed in an apparent assassination when his car exploded as he got into it. Dmitry Savluchenko was head of the families, youth, and sports department of the Kherson Military-Civilian Administration. The Kremlin has described the attack as “nothing but an act of terrorism”. European leaders granted Ukraine candidate status late on Thursday, in a historic decision that opens the door to EU membership for the war-torn country and deals a blow to Vladimir Putin. EU leaders meeting in Brussels approved Ukraine’s candidate status nearly four months after the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, launched his country’s bid to join the bloc in the early days of the Russian invasion. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, declared it was “a good day for Europe”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said it was historic decision that sent “a strong signal towards Russia in the current geopolitical context”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, immediately welcomed the move, saying: “Ukraine’s future is in the EU.” “It’s a victory … we have been waiting for 120 days and 30 years,” he added, referring to the duration of the war and the decades since Ukraine became independent on the breakup of the Soviet Union. “And now we will defeat the enemy.” The UN nuclear watchdog has said it is increasingly concerned about the welfare of Ukrainian staff at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said: “The IAEA is aware of recent reports in the media and elsewhere indicating a deteriorating situation for Ukrainian staff at the country’s largest nuclear power plant.” Moscow’s foreign ministry blamed the United States for a Lithuanian ban on sanctioned goods crossing from the Russian mainland to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Lithuania has prevented goods that are banned by EU sanctions from transiting its territory by rail. Russia has threatened repercussions. G7 foreign ministers called on Russia to “cease its attacks and threatening actions” and to unblock the Ukrainian Black Sea ports for food exports. Russia is exacerbating food insecurity with its blockades and bombing attacks on key infrastructure in Ukraine, they said in a statement. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said Europe needs to ramp up efforts to cut its dependency from Russian fossil fuel imports. The US will send another $450m in military aid to Ukraine, including some additional medium-range rocket systems. The latest package includes four high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and tens of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition as well as patrol boats, Pentagon officials announced on Thursday. With the latest shipments, the US contribution to Ukraine’s military will amount to $6.1bn so far, White House spokesperson, John Kirby, added. More than 150 cultural sites in Ukraine have been partially or totally destroyed, according to a Unesco report. The damage includes 70 religious buildings, 30 historical buildings, 18 cultural centres, 15 monuments, 12 museums and seven libraries. Zelenskiy addressed crowds at Glastonbury festival in the UK and asked them to “spread the truth about Russia’s war” and “prove that freedom always wins”. In a video message to festivalgoers, Zelenskiy said people in Ukraine wanted to “live the life as we used to, enjoy freedom and this wonderful summer”. Ukraine is recording 200 to 300 war crimes committed by Russian forces on its territory every day, the prosecutor general has claimed. “War crimes are our trouble. Every day we have 200 to 300 of them … We have a duty: when there is a crime, we have to start an investigation,” Iryna Venediktova told Ukrainian television. Ukraine has held a preliminary hearing in its first trial of a Russian soldier charged with raping a Ukrainian woman during Moscow’s invasion – the first of what could be dozens of such cases. The suspect, Mikhail Romanov, 32, who will be tried in absentia, is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region outside Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while threatening her and her child. The Russian navy has been given orders to lay mines at the ports of Odesa and Ochakiv, and has already mined the Dnieper River, as part of a blockade of Ukrainian grain exports, according to newly declassified US intelligence. The US embassy in Russia has been pressing the Kremlin this week to reveal the whereabouts of two Alabama men captured in Ukraine, according to the mother of one of the taken Americans. Lois “Bunny” Drueke also said that her son, Alexander Drueke, and the other captured US military veteran, Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, were not mercenaries but volunteers, pushing back on statements from a Kremlin spokesperson who said the American pair were facing execution."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/05/south-korea-apologises-after-missile-fired-in-response-to-north-korea-test-crashes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-05T03:25:04Z","webTitle":"South Korea apologises after missile fired in response to North Korea test crashes ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/05/south-korea-apologises-after-missile-fired-in-response-to-north-korea-test-crashes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/05/south-korea-apologises-after-missile-fired-in-response-to-north-korea-test-crashes","fields":{"headline":"South Korea apologises after missile fired in response to North Korea test crashes ","bodyText":"South Korea’s military has apologised after a missile it launched during a drill on Tuesday malfunctioned and crashed to the ground, causing alarm among nearby residents who thought they were under attack from North Korea, which had test launched a missile earlier in the day. The live-fire drill, involving South Korea and the US, was supposed to be a show of strength by the allies, hours after the North sent an intermediate-range missile over northern Japan. Instead, it ended in embarrassment when a short-range Hyumoo-2 ballistic missile crashed to the ground inside an air force base near the South Korean coastal city of Gangneung. Although the missile did not explode, the noise and subsequent fire caused some Gangneung residents to believe the North had launched an attack, according to media reports. There were no reports of injuries. The South Korean military acknowledged the accident hours after internet users posted videos showing an orange ball of flames emerging from an area they described as near a Gangneung air force base. The military said it was investigating what had caused the “abnormal flight” of the South Korean missile – a key part of its preemptive and retaliatory strike strategies against the North. The accident occurred as the South Korean and US militaries fired a volley of missiles into the East Sea – also known as the Sea of Japan – in response to North Korea firing a ballistic missile over Japan for the first time in five years. The nuclear-armed state launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile that flew for a record distance of 4,600km (2,850 miles) at n altitude of 1,000km, in its most provocative weapons demonstration in years. That range puts the US Pacific territory of Guam, homes to American military bases, within striking distance. The missile landed in the Pacific Ocean about 3,200km east of Japan. Japan’s government issued an alert urging residents to take cover as the missile passed high over the northernmost main island of Hokkaido and Aomori prefecture. The US and South Korean militaries fired two ATACMS short-range ballistic missiles into the water “to precisely strike a virtual target,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. The drills “showed the ability and readiness to neutralise the origin of the provocation while maintaining a constant monitoring posture,” it said in a statement. On Tuesday, South Korean and US fighter jets had carried out a bombing drill at a target in the Yellow Sea. The drills aim to “make sure that we have the military capabilities at the ready to respond to provocations by the North if it comes to that,” US national security council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN. “It shouldn’t come to that. We have made it clear to (North Korean leader) Kim Jong-un we’re willing to sit down with no preconditions. We want to see the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” he said. “He hasn’t shown an inclination to move in that direction – and quite frankly he’s moving in the opposite direction by continuing to conduct these missile tests, which are violations of Security Council resolutions.” Pyongyang’s latest launch is part of a record year of sanctions-busting weapons tests by the isolated regime, which recently revised its laws to declare itself an “irreversible” nuclear power. US president Joe Biden and Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida condemned North Korea’s latest launch “in the strongest terms”. South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol called the launch a “provocation”, and vowed a “stern response”. The Tuesday test was Pyongyang’s fifth missile launch in 10 days. North Korea does not routinely comment on its weapons tests in state media. South Korean and US officials have been warning for months that Kim is preparing to conduct another nuclear test, saying last week that this could happen soon after Pyongyang’s key ally China holds a Communist party congress from 16 October. US vice-president Kamala Harris visited Seoul last week and toured the heavily fortified demilitarised zone that divides the Korean peninsula, on a trip to underscore her country’s commitment to South Korea’s defence. About 28,500 US troops are stationed in South Korea to help protect it from the North."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/08/germany-to-extend-energy-subsidies-to-smaller-firms-amid-closure-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T15:51:33Z","webTitle":"Germany to extend energy subsidies to smaller firms amid closure fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/08/germany-to-extend-energy-subsidies-to-smaller-firms-amid-closure-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/08/germany-to-extend-energy-subsidies-to-smaller-firms-amid-closure-fears","fields":{"headline":"Germany to extend energy subsidies to smaller firms amid closure fears","bodyText":"Germany plans to extend a scheme subsidising energy costs for big businesses that are heavily dependent on energy to all small and medium-sized businesses, as part of a package of measures designed to avoid a wave of insolvencies. Robert Habeck, the economy minister, said he anticipated that the subsidies would be in place for a limited time, until efforts on the national and European level to bring down high electricity and gas prices took effect. He said the government would be at pains to “change the design of the electricity market so that cheaper costs can be transferred to consumers”. The aim, he said, was to split the price of electricity from the price of gas. Both have risen markedly since Russia invaded Ukraine and supplies of Russian gas to Germany plummeted, stopping altogether a week ago. From October the government plans to financially compensate companies that lower their gas consumption. In some cases, companies are expected to temporarily stop production. Lobby groups have said increasing numbers of businesses are facing existential crises. On Thursday, bakers protested against soaring energy bills that many said threatened them with closure. Two leading economic institutes raised fears of a recession in Europe’s largest economy, lowering their forecasts for 2023 to a shrinkage of between 0.7% and 1.4%, after growth expectations announced in June of between 2% and 3.3%. Only one, RWI Essen, predicted growth, of about 0.8%. Habeck told the Bundestag there was a need to address the “demand shock” that would affect consumers and businesses, as many people were already reducing their spending to protect themselves against inflation. “We will embrace measures to ensure that the people in Germany will have enough money to be able to consume,” Habeck said, without giving further detail. Peter Adrian, the president of the German Chamber of Industry and Trade (DIHK), earlier told German media that many companies were in fear for their survival. “Increasing numbers of businesses have been telling us that they are no longer getting supply contracts for electricity or gas. They are having the tap closed on them, in the truest sense of the word,” he said. “Without energy, however, the economy will grind to a halt.” The government has pledged to temporarily relax rules on insolvency. A spokesperson for the justice ministry told the financial daily Handelsblatt that the change would happen “speedily”. He said the measure should help companies “which are in good health and long-term able to survive due to the changed parameters”. He said companies would be given the chance to “adapt their business models” to the changing circumstances. Habeck said he was optimistic that Germany would rise to the challenge, including the need to free itself from the stranglehold of Russia. Until recently, Germany had aimed to become independent from supplies of Russian gas by 2024. However, since Moscow turned off the remaining flow last Wednesday, citing the need for maintenance work, the separation has come about far quicker. “We have now been independent from Russian gas for a week, and our storage facilities are continuing to fill up,” he said, adding that the costs of gas since the switch-off were high “but they haven’t exploded”. Gas storage at 47 subterranean facilities across the country stood at about 87% on Thursday. The facilities can take about 28% of the amount of gas that Germany uses in an average year. EU energy ministers are due to meet on Friday to consider a price cap for Russian gas as well as a limit on the revenue of other energy sources, with a potential differentiation between renewable energy and energy from conventional coal and nuclear power plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/15/aims-software-avatars-team-jorge-disinformation-fake-profiles","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-15T04:00:03Z","webTitle":"‘Aims’: the software for hire that can control 30,000 fake online profiles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/15/aims-software-avatars-team-jorge-disinformation-fake-profiles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/15/aims-software-avatars-team-jorge-disinformation-fake-profiles","fields":{"headline":"‘Aims’: the software for hire that can control 30,000 fake online profiles","bodyText":"At first glance, the Twitter user “Canaelan” looks ordinary enough.

The profile shows a friendly-looking blond man with a stubbly beard and glasses who, it indicates, lives in Sheffield. The background: a winking owl. Canaelan is, in fact, a non-human bot linked to a vast army of fake social media profiles controlled by a software designed to spread “propaganda”. Advanced Impact Media Solutions, or Aims, which controls more than 30,000 fake social media profiles, can be used to spread disinformation at scale and at speed. It is sold by “Team Jorge”, a unit of disinformation operatives based in Israel. Tal Hanan, who runs the covert group using the pseudonym “Jorge”, told undercover reporters that they sold access to their software to unnamed intelligence agencies, political parties and corporate clients. One appears to have been sold to a client who wanted to discredit the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), a statutory watchdog. On 18 October 2020, the ICO ruled that the government should reveal which companies were awarded multimillion-pound contracts to supply PPE after being entered into a “VIP” lane for politically connected companies. “This is politically motivated, it’s clear!” Canaelan lamented on Twitter two days later. That comment was part of a chorus of disapproval generated by the bots, who seemed aghast. “Information Commissioner tries everything to destroy the government,” one said, while another described the ruling as a “desperate act”. All of the “replies” under that and other tweets were united in their outrage at the ICO, which they described as “a waste of time” and “lame”. As the replies continued, they became more trenchant, making wild and false accusations against the ICO about bribes, corruption and links to the far right. Others just seemed nonplussed by the ICO’s insistence on transparency over the government’s pandemic procurement. “This is so typical from the UK …” one bot opined, “focusing on the wrong things.” It is not known who commissioned Team Jorge to unleash the bots on the ICO, or why. Hanan did not respond to detailed requests for comment but said: “To be clear, I deny any wrongdoing.” The ICO campaign appears to have been relatively short-lived compared with others around the world that reporters have been able to link to Team Jorge’s Aims software, which is much more than a bot-controlling programme. Each avatar, according to a demonstration Hanan gave the undercover reporters, is given a multifaceted digital backstory. Aims enables the creation of accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Telegram, Gmail, Instagram and YouTube. Some even have Amazon accounts with credit cards, bitcoin wallets and Airbnb accounts. Hanan told the undercover reporters his avatars mimicked human behaviour and their posts were powered by artificial intelligence. Using the Aims-linked avatars revealed by Team Jorge in presentations and videos, reporters at the Guardian, Le Monde and Der Spiegel were able to identify a much wider network of 2,000 Aims-linked bots on Facebook and Twitter. We then traced their activity across the internet, identifying their involvement in what appeared to be mostly commercial disputes in about 20 countries including the UK, US, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Greece, Panama, Senegal, Mexico, Morocco, India, the United Arab Emirates, Zimbabwe, Belarus and Ecuador. The analysis revealed a vast array of bot activity, with Aims’ fake social media profiles getting involved in a dispute in California over nuclear power; a #MeToo controversy in Canada; a campaign in France involving a Qatari UN official; and an election in Senegal. One of the Aims-backed campaigns targeted a Monaco-based superyacht company, accusing it of having direct links to several Russian oligarchs who were subject to sanctions. We also identified real-world events that appeared to have been staged to provide ammunition that could be leveraged in social media campaigns. One case involved a fake protest staged outside a company headquarters on Regent Street, central London. Three masked activists in baseball caps, sunglasses and masks filmed themselves waving placards. A similar leafletting campaign was staged near the Eiffel Tower in Paris, before being circulated on social media by Aims bots. It is not possible to know who the clients were in any of the campaigns, or even what their objective was. However, what seems clear is that the avatars peddling propaganda are doing so with the help of stolen photographs of real people. The photo of a beaming man on Canaelan’s Twitter bio, the Guardian has established, was taken from the real Twitter page of Tom Van Rooijen, 25, a freelance Dutch journalist living in the Netherlands. Informed about the identity theft by the Guardian, Van Rooijen said he felt “quite uncomfortable” seeing his face beside a tweet expressing views he disagreed with. “I give a lot of workshops to school classes about news, media, journalism and fake news. I teach children weekly that their identity can be stolen by a Twitter bot,” he said. “I never thought my own identity would be stolen by a bot.” Van Rooijen is likely to be among tens of thousands of unsuspecting victims whose images have been harvested by Team Jorge. Other techniques are also used to lend the avatars credibility and avoid the bot-detection systems created by tech platforms. Hanan said his bots were linked to SMS-verified phone numbers, and some even had credit cards. Aims also has different groups of avatars with various nationalities and languages, with evidence they have been pushing narratives in Russian, Spanish, French and Japanese. Those involved in the ICO campaign had been made to seem British, retweeting news articles from the Guardian, BBC, the Daily Mail and the Telegraph. They showed an interest in the royal family, Glastonbury and Liz Truss’s performance as foreign minister, and posted lighthearted jokes about British weather and food, as well as scenic photos from Wiltshire and Yorkshire. Those backgrounds provided some credibility when, later, they suddenly began expressing views about the UK’s data watchdog. Twitter declined to comment. Meta, the owner of Facebook, this week took down Aims-linked bots on its platform after reporters shared a sample of the fake accounts with the company. On Tuesday, a Meta spokesperson connected the Aims bots to others that were linked in 2019 to another, now-defunct Israeli firm which it banned from the platform. “This latest activity is an attempt by some of the same individuals to come back and we removed them for violating our policies,” the spokesperson said. “The group’s latest activity appears to have centred around running fake petitions on the internet or seeding fabricated stories in mainstream media outlets.” For all of their apparent sophistication, some Aims avatars betrayed giveaways. One of the Twitter bots involved in UK campaigns alongside Canaelan was “Alexander”, whose profile picture showed a young man with a sculpted beard in a white beanie hat. The background: orange tulips beside a chirpy slogan “Be happy”. And his profile bio consisted of two short sentences that hinted at an interest in falsehoods – and how to make them convincing: “The difference between fiction and reality?’ Fiction has to make sense.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-arrives-in-berlin-after-germany-announces-further-27bn-of-military-aid","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-14T21:02:06Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war – as it happened: Zelenskiy arrives in France to meet Macron after Germany visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-arrives-in-berlin-after-germany-announces-further-27bn-of-military-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-arrives-in-berlin-after-germany-announces-further-27bn-of-military-aid","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war – as it happened: Zelenskiy arrives in France to meet Macron after Germany visit","bodyText":"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy landed in Paris on Sunday ahead of his bilateral talks with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. “Paris.

During his visit to Germany, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was awarded the prestigious Charlemagne prize on behalf of the Ukrainian people on Sunday in honour of services to Europe, the Associated Press reports. Zelenskiy received the award, which honours services to European unification, in the western city of Aachen with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after the two leaders held talks in Berlin. Russia has “already lost geopolitically” its war in Ukraine and is transforming into a vassal state of China, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in an interview with Opinion newspaper published on Sunday. “De facto, it has entered a form of subservience with regards to China and has lost its access to the Baltic, which was critical, because it prompted the decision by Sweden and Finland to join Nato,” said Macron. Zelenskiy thanked Germany for its support and what he called the largest military aid package since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion as he met with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin. The trip came after the German government announced a new military package worth €2.7bn as Ukrainian forces prepare for a counteroffensive to reclaim territory captured by Russia.

With each visit, Ukraine’s defense and offensive capabilities are expanding,” Zelensky tweeted as he arrived on Sunday evening at the airbase of Villacoublay southwest of Paris, Agence France-Presse reports. “The ties with Europe are getting stronger, and the pressure on Russia is growing.” Macron shortly afterwards welcomed Zelensky to the Elysee Palace, for the second time since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February last year. The French leader’s office said the pair would discuss France’s “support” in responding to “Ukraine’s urgent military and humanitarian needs” during a dinner at the presidential palace. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived in France ahead of his bilateral talks with French president Emmanuel Macron, Reuters reports. He was welcomed by the French prime minister and the French foreign minister. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will make a surprise visit to Paris for talks on Sunday night with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Macron’s office announced the Paris leg of Zelenskiy’s trip, and France dispatched a plane to pick up Zelenskiy in Germany, where he met the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, earlier on Sunday, the Associated Press reports. Macron’s office said the two leaders will hold talks over dinner and that Macron will “reaffirm France and Europe’s unwavering support to reestablish Ukraine in its legitimate rights and to defend its fundamental interests”. During his visit to Germany, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was awarded the prestigious Charlemagne prize on behalf of the Ukrainian people on Sunday in honour of services to Europe, the Associated Press reports. Zelenskiy received the award, which honours services to European unification, in the western city of Aachen with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after the two leaders held talks in Berlin. At the awards ceremony in Aachen town hall, Zelenskiy was met with standing ovation. “Ukrainians will always make Europe stronger,” Zelenskiy said, addressing a crowd that included the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. “Ukraine is proposing a victory not just in this war but a victory over aggression, annexations, deportations over the catastrophe of genocide, anywhere throughout the world,” he said. Scholz reaffirmed Germany’s support for Ukraine’s aspirations to join the EU and said that Russian aggression will not deter Ukraine. “Vladimir Putin may have thought he could force the Ukrainian nation off its path to Europe through violence, but all his tanks, drones and rocket launchers have had quite the opposite effect,” said Scholz. Russia has “already lost geopolitically” its war in Ukraine and is transforming into a vassal state of China, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in an interview with Opinion newspaper published on Sunday, the Associated Press reports. “De facto, it has entered a form of subservience with regards to China and has lost its access to the Baltic, which was critical, because it prompted the decision by Sweden and Finland to join Nato,” said Macron. “This was unthinkable just two years ago. So it’s already a geopolitical defeat,” Macron said ahead of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to Paris later on Sunday. “Let’s be clear, Russia must not win this war militarily. So it’s up to us to see how to help the Ukrainians with their counteroffensive, and how to prepare the issue of security guarantees in the negotiations that will inevitably take place,” he said. “I’ve always said that in the end, Europe’s security architecture will have to fully defend Ukraine. But it must also envisage non-confrontation with Russia and rebuild a sustainable balance of forces,” he said, adding: “But there are still many steps that must be taken before we get to that.” Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy visited Germany for the first time since the Russian invasion. Zelenskiy thanked Germany for its support and what he called the largest military aid package since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion as he met with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin.

President Zelenskiy is set to continue his whistle-stop tour of Europe, with French media reporting that the Ukrainian leader is expected to arrive in France later on Sunday. It appears that president Zelenskiy is set to continue his whistle-stop tour of Europe, with French media reporting that the Ukrainian leader is expected to arrive in France later today. Le Figaro said Zelenskiy would be greeted at the Vélizy-Villacoublay airport in Paris by the French prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, and the foreign minister, Catherine Colonna. Ukraine has recaptured 10 miles around Bakhmut over three days, according to a US thinktank. The Institute for the Study of War said 10.5 square miles were recaptured, while Russian military bloggers said attacks to the west safeguarded Ukrainian access to the city via an important highway. After reports that Volodymyr Zelenskiy has plotted attacks inside Russia in private meetings with top military aides (see 11.38), the Ukrainian president has insisted he has no plans to hit targets in Russia. After talks in Berlin with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, he said: We are not attacking Russian territory. We are preparing a counterattack to de-occupy the illegitimately conquered territories. Russia has accused Ukraine of hitting targets inside Russia, including attempting a drone strike on the Kremlin with the aim of killing the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, earlier this month. Ukraine denies the accusations, but says it has the right to use force and other means to remove Russian forces from its territories. Zelenskiy is now heading to the western German city of Aachen, where he and the Ukrainian people will be given the Charlemagne prize – an honour awarded for efforts to foster European unity. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, are also due to attend the ceremony in Aachen, ahead of an EU summit in Reykjavik on Tuesday, followed by the G7 gathering of world leaders in Hiroshima, Japan. The Russian Ministry of Defence has reported the death of two of its colonels on 13-14 May in the Bakhmut area. The Financial Times’ Christopher Hope adds that the Russian colonels were killed by Ukrainian forces in the area of Bakhmut. They were Col Vyacheslav Makarov, commander of the 4th motorised rifle brigade, and Col Yevgeny Brovko, the deputy commander of the army corps for military-political work. The Russian Defence Ministry said Makarov died on the way to a hospital after being wounded during a fight south of Ivanivske village, to the west of Bakhmut, where Ukrainian forces recaptured land this week. Brovko was killed in shelling and received multiple shrapnel wounds. President Zelenskiy has held a joint news conference with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin today. He said that Kyiv and its western supporters could make Russia’s defeat in the war in Ukraine “irreversible” this year. He also thanked Germany for its military support and said his country would always be grateful to Germany for its support during Russia’s full-scale invasion. He said: Now is the time for us to determine the end of the war already this year, we can make the aggressor’s defeat irreversible already this year. Ukraine is expected to launch spring counteroffensive operations imminently to try to recapture swathes of its east and south territories from Russian forces. Zelenskiy stressed that while Kyiv would discuss peace initiatives from other states, any proposals had to be based on Ukraine’s position and its peace plan. He said: The war is happening on the territory of our country and so any peace plan will be based on Ukraine’s proposals. Kyiv has previously said it wants to regain every part of its land currently occupied by Russian forces and it will not be willing to make territorial concessions. Moscow says it controls the Crimean peninsula and four other Ukraine regions: Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk. You can read our report about Putin’s annexing of those regions in September last year here: President Zelenskiy has tweeted his thanks to Germany “for the largest military aid package since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion”. He stated, in German first and then in English: German air defense systems, artillery, tanks and infantry fighting vehicles are saving Ukrainian lives and bringing us closer to victory. Germany is a reliable ally! Together we are bringing peace closer! Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine, has posted a short video on Twitter of the security measures in force today in Germany for president Zelenskiy’s visit. The Washington Post yesterday reported that in private meetings with top military aides, president Zelenskiy had plotted attacks inside Russia, according to leaks from communications intercepted by US spies. The Post’s diplomacy and national security correspondent John Hudson said Zelenskiy had discussed occupying Russian villages to gain leverage over Moscow, bombing a pipeline that transfers Russian oil to Hungary, a Nato member, and privately pining for long-range missiles to hit targets inside Russia’s borders, per leaked documents. You can read the story here. Zelenskiy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak has also tweeted that he has been speaking to the US President Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, today. He said the pair had discussed the current state of the war and “ensuring unity and support” at the meeting of the G7, which will take place in the middle of May in the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Yermak also stated that Russia’s econony had to be “destroyed” with sanctions to “make them pay for their crimes”. The Kyiv Independent is reporting that an unexploded device left behind by the Russian army has killed five people, after it exploded in Myroliubivka, a village in Kherson Oblast today. Those killed were between 27 and 68, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said. The home town of Ukraine’s Eurovision contestants Tvorchi has been attacked a second time, the Ukraine State Emergency Service has said. Two people were injured by missile strikes on the Ternopil sparking fires which burned until 2.30am. The SES has said more explosions damaged civilian buildings and cars at 5am. “There is currently no information about the victims,” it wrote on Telegram. After the first attack, the electro-pop duo said: Ternopil is the name of our hometown, which was bombed by Russia while we sang on the Eurovision stage about our steel hearts, indomitability and will. This is a message for all cities of Ukraine that are shelled every day. Kharkiv, Dnipro, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Uman, Sumy, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Kherson and all others. Europe, unite against evil for the sake of peace. Glory to Ukraine. The UK Ministry of Defence has posted an update on the situation in Ukraine. It states that while Russian forces retain the same organisational structure to when it invaded Ukraine last February, it is, in fact, a very different military force. It states that in February 2022 “it consisted of professional soldiers; was largely equipped with reasonably modern vehicles; and had been regularly exercised, aspiring to complex, joint operations\".” Now, however, it says “the force is mostly poorly trained mobilised reservists and increasingly reliant on antiquated equipment, with many of its units severely under-strength. It routinely only conducts very simple, infantry-based operations.” Today is Mother’s Day in Ukraine: Even as Russia attacked Kyiv again last night, young people partied and supported the country’s Eurovision entry. David Pratt, Contributing Foreign Editor at the Herald in Scotland Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked Germany for its support as he met with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Sunday in his first visit to the country since Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy flew on a German government plane escorted over German airspace by fighter jets of the Luftwaffe air force, arriving in the middle of the night. Reuters reports that Zelenskiy wrote in the guest book of the German presidency: In the most challenging time in the modern history of Ukraine, Germany proud to be our true friend and reliable ally. Together we will win and bring peace back to Europe. From Reuters: Zelenskiy is expected to meet later with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his security cabinet before heading to Aachen in west Germany to receive the prestigious Charlemagne prize in honour of services to Europe. Germany, which is Europe’s largest economy, faced criticism at the start of the war for what some called a hesitant response, but it has become one of Ukraine’s biggest providers of financial and military assistance. On Saturday the German government announced 2.7 billion euro ($3 billion) of military aid to Ukraine, its biggest package since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. The country’s leaders pledged to support Kyiv for as long as is necessary. Zelenskiy hailed this as a “powerful package” in a tweet, indicating that he aimed to discuss weapons supply as well as air defence, reconstruction, Ukraine’s candidacy for membership of the European Union and security with German officials. Zelenskiy last visited Germany for the Munich Security Council in February last year just before the war broke out. Germany was constrained in its support for Ukraine at that time both by its energy dependence on Russia and a pacifism rooted in its bloody 20th century history. This required a major policy upheaval and a shift in mindset that Scholz dubbed a “Zeitenwende” or turn of era, in a landmark speech just days after the war broke out. (Reporting by Andreas Rinke and Sarah Marsh Editing by David Goodman and Frances Kerry) Here are some of the latest images coming out of Ukraine: The G7 and European Union will ban Russian gas imports on routes where Moscow cut supplies off last year, according to the Financial Times. The decision, to be finalised by G7 leaders at a summit in Hiroshima starting on Friday, will prevent the resumption of Russian pipeline gas exports on routes to countries such as Poland and Germany. The home town of Ukraine’s Eurovision entry came under fire from Russian missiles during the song contest on Saturday. Ternopil, the university home town of electronic music duo Tvorchi, was among the places targeted, with local authorities confirming two people had been injured. The band was performing on stage as air raid sirens rang out across Ternopil and later posted a message of solidarity to their Instagram: “Europe, unite against evil for the sake of peace! GLORY TO UKRAINE!” For more on this story: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy landed in Berlin overnight as he seeks to shore up support from key allies. “Already in Berlin,” Zelenskiy tweeted shortly after midnight on Sunday, arriving from Italy where he met with Italian officials and Pope Francis. The trip comes after the German government announced a new military package worth €2.7bn as Ukrainian forces prepare for a counter-offensive to reclaim territory captured by Russia. According to local media reports, Zelenskiy is expected to meet in the morning with German chancellor Olaf Scholz and president Frank-Walter Steinmeier. He may also head to the western German city of Aachen, which is awarding him and the Ukrainian people the Charlemagne prize – an honour awarded for efforts to foster European unity. Welcome back to our continuing coverage the war in Ukraine, I’m Yang Tian bringing you the latest. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has landed in Berlin, according to a post on his Twitter feed. “Already in Berlin,” Zelenskiy tweeted shortly after midnight on Sunday after the German government announced a further €2.7bn of military aid to Ukraine, its biggest such package since the Russian invasion. Russian missiles struck the home town of Ukraine’s Eurovision entry Tvorchi during the song contest. Authorities in Ternopil said the strike had hit warehouses and injured two people. More details coming shortly. In other key developments: The Russian news outlet Kommersant reported that two Russian fighter jets and two military helicopters had been shot down on Saturday close to the Ukrainian border. Kommersant said on its website that the Su-34 fighter-bomber, Su-35 fighter and two Mi-8 helicopters had made up a raiding party, and had been “shot down almost simultaneously” in an ambush in the Bryansk region, adjoining north-east Ukraine. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will push other global leaders to pledge more support for Ukraine when he attends international summits next week, according to his office. Sunak will travel to Iceland on Tuesday to meet other European leaders attending a Council of Europe summit. South Africa’s presidential security adviser said the country was “actively non-aligned” in Russia’s war against Ukraine, after US allegations it had supplied weapons to Moscow led to a diplomatic crisis. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had spoken to the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and urged him to help implement Kyiv’s peace plan to end the war. Ukrainian forces have regained at least a kilometre of territory in Bakhmut amid a Russian withdrawal that reflects Moscow’s “severe shortage of credible combat units”, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in an intelligence briefing. It said elements of a Russian brigade withdrew “in bad order” from their positions on the southern flank of the eastern Ukrainian city, the scene of the war’s longest battle. Japan has expressed concern about Russian and Chinese military cooperation in Asia and believes the two countries are strengthening their joint exercises. Foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said the security situation in Europe and the Indo-Pacific region was indivisible since the war in Ukraine started and that Russia’s invasion had “shaken the very foundation of the international order”. Russian attacks injured three people in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, the city’s mayor said. The strikes occurred early on Saturday, Oleksandr Sienkevych said on his Telegram channel. Russian forces targeted a factory, also damaging nearby residential buildings, causing fires in three apartments and damaging an educational institution, he said. A 15-year-old girl was among two people killed while 10 more were injured in a Russian shelling attack, Ukraine’s defence ministry said. The eastern city of Kostyantynivka was targeted by Smerch rocket launchers. Russian-installed officials in Luhansk have said missiles fired by Ukrainian forces injured six children and a Russian parliamentarian and damaged two disused factories in the eastern Ukrainian region’s main city, about 100km (60 miles) behind the frontlines. An unidentified object that entered Polish airspace from the direction of Belarus was probably an observation balloon, Poland’s defence ministry said on Saturday. A spokesperson for Poland’s territorial defence force said a search for the object was under way. Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit after a suspected attack on the Kremlin last week. The unit was launched on Tuesday during the annual second world war Victory Day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have said. Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident from shelling at the Russian-occupied nuclear power station, Europe’s biggest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/19/the-guardian-view-on-war-in-ukraine-fighting-on-multiple-fronts","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T17:30:16Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on war in Ukraine: fighting on multiple fronts | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/the-guardian-view-on-war-in-ukraine-fighting-on-multiple-fronts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/the-guardian-view-on-war-in-ukraine-fighting-on-multiple-fronts","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on war in Ukraine: fighting on multiple fronts ","bodyText":"A spate of explosions in Crimea has bolstered the mood in Ukraine. While Kyiv has been coy in discussing the incidents publicly, dropping heavy hints but not explicitly taking credit, unnamed officials have been busy briefing reporters. On 9 August, nine or more Russian warplanes appear to have been destroyed at the Saky airbase on the peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. Then, on Tuesday, blasts were reported at an ammunition site and airfield. Russia blamed “sabotage”. On Thursday night, there were reports of more explosions at the major Belbek airbase, as well as a blaze at a munitions depot inside Russia. All these are a much-needed fillip for Ukrainian morale. A senior presidential adviser has said that there is “strategic deadlock”. Though the picture in the country’s south is muddled, Russian forces appear largely stalled. But Ukraine is massively outgunned and Russia continues to gain ground in the east, albeit slowly and with serious losses, by pounding away with heavy artillery and no regard for the cost to Ukrainian civilians or its own forces. Events in Crimea are a long way from turning the tide. Officials in Ukraine say that they hope hitting deep into occupied territory will cut supply routes and erode Russian capabilities. The defence minister has said that it will ultimately launch a full-scale counter-offensive, when it has the weapons and ammunition that it needs from its partners. In other words, its more nimble approach is a matter of necessity as well as ability. Additionally, wars are only partially fought on the battlefield. Kyiv also needs to kindle renewed purpose at home and maintain national unity as the relief and pride at holding off the initial Russian onslaught inevitably fades, and grinding economic, social and psychological pressures take their toll. It needs to rattle the confidence of Moscow – which this week replaced the commander of its Black Sea fleet – and lower the morale of Russian forces. Russia felt safe in Crimea, with its tourists sunning themselves on the beaches. Now they have been filmed fleeing the sands, with plumes of black smoke visible in the distance. Finally, Kyiv needs a sense of fresh momentum to maintain support elsewhere. The story of a plucky, courageous underdog staving off a vicious invasion was enough to create a wave of public and political support across Europe this spring. As fuel prices keep rising and winter approaches, sympathy and solidarity will ebb, and politicians are likely to become correspondingly warier of extending their support to Ukraine and punishment of Russia. It has also been clear from the beginning of the conflict that a less confident Vladimir Putin may be more dangerous. On Thursday, Moscow snubbed the call from the UN secretary general, António Guterres, visiting Ukraine, for a withdrawal of military equipment and personnel from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest. Russia seized the plant this spring and the two countries have accused each other of shelling the site. Ukraine has warned that Russia may plan to stage a “provocation” there or to stop generating electricity – which could increase the risk of an accident. Mr Putin knows that the weaponisation of a nuclear plant would be crossing a new frontier. But brinkmanship is itself a danger, bearing the risks of unintended disaster. Whatever confidence Kyiv has gained from the damage in Crimea, it will not mistake events this week as offering respite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/24/russia-strikes-are-against-humanity-zelenskiy-tells-un-as-power-cut-in-ukraine-and-moldova","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-24T01:20:22Z","webTitle":"Russia strikes are crime against humanity, Zelenskiy tells UN, as power cut in Ukraine and Moldova","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/24/russia-strikes-are-against-humanity-zelenskiy-tells-un-as-power-cut-in-ukraine-and-moldova","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/24/russia-strikes-are-against-humanity-zelenskiy-tells-un-as-power-cut-in-ukraine-and-moldova","fields":{"headline":"Russia strikes are crime against humanity, Zelenskiy tells UN, as power cut in Ukraine and Moldova","bodyText":"Fresh Russian strikes battered Ukraine’s already failing electricity grid, causing blackouts across the country and in neighbouring Moldova, in attacks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the UN were “an obvious crime against humanity”. Addressing an urgent meeting of the UN security council late on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Ukraine would put forward a resolution condemning “any forms of energy terror”. Referring to Russia’s likely veto, he said, “it’s nonsense that the veto right is secured for the party that wages this war.” “We cannot be hostage to one international terrorist,” Zelenskiy said. He also invited the UN to send experts to examine and evaluate Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. “When we have the temperature below zero, and scores of millions of people without energy supplies, without heating, without water, this is an obvious crime against humanity,” Zelenskiy told the security council via video link. It comes as talks between the G7 and other pro-Ukraine allies to set a cap on the price of Russian oil reportedly hit a set-back, after a meeting between EU officials ended without agreement. The price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil will form part of sanctions intended to punish Moscow by limiting its revenues from oil exports. EU diplomats were reportedly unable to reach an agreement on what price the cap should be set at. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. The country’s Energy Ministry said supplies were cut to “the vast majority of electricity consumers”. All of Kyiv lost water, the capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. The city’s administration said water and heating would return to residential buildings on Thursday morning. Late Wednesday, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office said that Kyiv and over a dozen regions, including Lviv and Odesa in the south, had been reconnected to the power grid. Klitschko said 21 out of 31 missiles targeting Kyiv were shot down before they reached their targets. One of the 10 that evaded the defences hit an apartment block in Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of the city, killing three people and wounding 15. There was a kindergarten in the lower ground floor of the building, but it was evacuated after air raid sirens went off. The blast left a three-metre crater in front of the building, destroyed apartments around it, blew the tops of nearby trees and ruined a children’s playground. “It flew right over us. We heard a whistling sound and then it came down on the building,” said Ruslan Vorona, a local resident. He and his eight-year-old son, Oleksii, were sheltering and charging their phones in a tent set up by the emergency services. Another local man, Oleksandr, 28, who would not give his last name, said: “There were a few explosions. Two were quieter and one was louder, and one of the missiles went straight over my head.” Earlier in the day, a newborn baby was killed when a Russian rocket struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s state emergency service said a woman with her two-day-old baby and a doctor were in the facility in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, when it was hit. The mother and the doctor were pulled alive from the rubble by rescue workers but the baby died, it said on the Telegram messaging app. UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo demanded at the security council meeting that Russia immediately stop the attacks, which violate international humanitarian law, stressing “there must be accountability for any violations of the laws of war.” US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Vladimir Putin was “weaponising winter to inflict intense suffering on the Ukraine people”. Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told the security council that Moscow was carrying out “strikes against infrastructure in response to the unbridled flow of weapons to Ukraine and the reckless appeals of Kyiv to defeat Russia”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the latest series of Russian strikes were a response to a decision by the European parliament to recognise Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism” over its nine-month invasion of Ukraine, and its call for the 27-nation EU to follow. “Being unable to win in a fair fight with the Ukrainian army, Russia wages a cowardly war of terror against civilians,” Kuleba said, urging Kyiv’s western backers to supply more air defence systems. Wednesday’s decision by European legislators to recognise Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism” is a symbolic political step with no legal consequences. Kyiv has for months called on the international community to declare Russia a “terrorist state,” and the EU parliament’s decision will probably anger Moscow. The resolution approved by EU lawmakers said the “deliberate attacks and atrocities carried out by the Russian Federation against the civilian population of Ukraine … and other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law amount to acts of terror.” Ukraine praised the decision, with Zelenskiy calling for Russia to be “held accountable in order to end its longstanding policy of terrorism in Ukraine and across the globe.” Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2021/apr/23/children-of-chernobyl-parents-have-no-higher-number-of-dna-mutations","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-23T15:56:59Z","webTitle":"Children of Chernobyl parents have no higher number of DNA mutations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/23/children-of-chernobyl-parents-have-no-higher-number-of-dna-mutations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2021/apr/23/children-of-chernobyl-parents-have-no-higher-number-of-dna-mutations","fields":{"headline":"Children of Chernobyl parents have no higher number of DNA mutations","bodyText":"For decades popular culture has portrayed babies born to the survivors of nuclear accidents as mutants with additional heads or at high risk of cancers. But now a study of children whose parents were exposed to radiation from the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 suggests they carry no more DNA mutations than children born to any other parents. The study, published in Science, is one of the first to systematically evaluate alterations in human mutation rates in response to a manmade disaster, such as accidental radiation exposure. As well as providing fresh insights into how radiation affects the human body, the findings should help reassure other people who may have been exposed to radiation, such as those living near the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan in 2011, that it is safe to return home or have children. “There’s a lot of reticence among people to go back, and one of the major concerns is the transgenerational effects,” said Dr Stephen Chanock, of the National Cancer Institute in Rockville, Maryland, who supervised the research. “There’s this science-fiction societal view of three-headed babies, which is really accentuated in the Fukushima setting right now.” Although ionising radiation can damage DNA in the cells of people exposed to it, potentially their risk of cancer, it was less clear whether egg and sperm cells were similarly affected. In theory, mutations in these cells could be transmitted down the generations, potentially triggering developmental disorders or cancers in the descendents of radiation-exposed individuals. To investigate this possibility, Chanock and his colleagues analysed the genomes of 130 children born to parents who were either involved in the cleanup of the Chernobyl site after the accident, or were evacuated from nearby towns and settlements, as well the parents’ genomes. All of the children were conceived after the accident. Even though their parents had been exposed to high levels of radiation, there was no increase in the number of new mutations – those not detected in either parent but that could have arisen because of damage to their eggs or sperm – in these children. “These mutations may be in the parents’ blood, but we’re not seeing this horrific science-fiction-like mutation of sperm and eggs,” said Chanock. “I think this should be reassuring data that there’s a lack of evidence for substantial or significant transgenerational effects.” Dr Alex Cagan, a postdoctoral fellow at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Hinxton, England, said: “While these findings do not diminish the innumerable personal tragedies associated with the Chernobyl nuclear accident they do provide a glimmer of hope that the potentially damaging effects to DNA do not appear to have been passed down to the children of those involved.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-dozens-of-towns-recaptured-in-east-and-south-says-zelenskiy","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-05T17:18:49Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Putin changes mobilisation rules as Kremlin defends retreat from occupied regions – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-dozens-of-towns-recaptured-in-east-and-south-says-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-dozens-of-towns-recaptured-in-east-and-south-says-zelenskiy","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Putin changes mobilisation rules as Kremlin defends retreat from occupied regions – as it happened","bodyText":"The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has signed the four laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four areas, and it remains unclear where Russia is attempting to set its new external border. Ukraine has made major and rapid advances this week, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying in an address on Tuesday night that “dozens” of towns had been recaptured. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, and in the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. Pro-Russian leaders in the occupied regions have claimed that the situation is stabilising this morning. Denis Pushilin, installed as governor in Donetsk by Russia, has said “the situation on the front line in the Lyman direction is stabilising, the defence line is being strengthened”, while Kirill Stremousov, part of the occupation administration imposed on Kherson, has been quoted saying that Russian forces were “conducting a regrouping in order to gather their strength and deliver a retaliatory blow” in the region, and that “the advance of the armed forces of Ukraine in the Kherson direction has stopped”. None of the claims could be independently verified. Asked about the proposed borders, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: “In general, of course, there we are talking about the territory in which the military-civilian administration operated at the time of admission [to Russia]. But I repeat once again: certain territories there will be returned, and we will continue to consult with the population that expresses a desire to live with Russia.” The UK ministry of defence has said in its daily operational briefing that “Ukraine continues to make progress in offensive operations along both the north-eastern and southern fronts. In the north-east, in Kharkiv oblast, Ukraine has now consolidated a substantial area of territory east of the Oskil River.” Putin said in televised comments that he had signed a decree making “corrections” to the partial mobilisation drive he announced 21 September. The Russian president said the decree would defer conscription for additional categories of students, including those enrolled at accredited private universities and certain postgraduate students. The EU has agreed to set a price cap on Russian oil and ban trade in numerous technical and consumer goods, as part of further sanctions designed to counter Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. The latest round of sanctions, the eighth since February, were signed off by EU ambassadors on Wednesday, a week after the measures were proposed, a timescale regarded as lightning speed in Brussels. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) would operate under the supervision of Russian agencies after the annexation declaration. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the earliest days of the war. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-enterprise that owns the plant, has said it may restart it to ensure safety. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, said that overnight “the enemy fired rockets at the regional centre and the outskirts of the city. Infrastructure facilities were destroyed.” Zelenskiy has posted a series of images of damaged buildings across social media from recently liberated Lyman, with the message “Our Lyman after the occupier. All basics of life have been destroyed here. They are doing so everywhere in the territories they seize. This can be stopped in one way only: liberate Ukraine, life, humanity, law and truth as soon as possible.” The Russian TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, famous for staging an on-air protest against Russia’s war in Ukraine, confirmed she had escaped house arrest over further charges of spreading fake news, saying she had no case to answer. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, says Washington’s decision to send more military aid to Ukraine poses a threat to Moscow’s interests and increases the risk of a military clash between Russia and the west. Russia’s foreign ministry said that it had expelled a Lithuanian diplomat. The British prime minister, Liz Truss, has said that Ukraine “will win” and that no peace deal should give away Ukrainian territory. She said: “The Ukrainian people aren’t just fighting for their security but for all of our security. This is a fight for freedom and democracy around the world. We should not give in to those who want a deal which trades away Ukrainian land. They are proposing to pay in Ukrainian lives for the illusion of peace. We will stand with our Ukrainian friends, however long it takes. Ukraine can win. Ukraine must win. And Ukraine will win.” The latest report from Guardian correspondents in Kyiv and Kryvyi Rih. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to concede the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals in Ukraine, insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. Russia has suffered significant losses in two of the four regions since Friday, when Putin signed treaties to incorporate them into Russia by force, with Russian officials saying their forces were “regrouping”. With Ukraine pushing its advance in the east and south, Russian troops have been retreating under pressure on both fronts, confronted by fast moving and agile Ukrainian forces supplied with advanced western-supplied artillery systems. Read in full here: Ukrainian staff running the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) are preparing to restart one of the plant’s six reactors, all of which are currently shut down, the UN nuclear watchdog has said. “Senior Ukrainian operating staff informed IAEA experts present at the ZNPP that preparations are under way to start unit 5 at reduced power to produce steam and heat for the needs of the plant,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement, adding that preparations would take “some time”. President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Wednesday ordering the Russian government to take control of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and make it “federal property”, Reuters reported. The plant, the biggest in Europe, is controlled by Russian troops but has been operated until now by Ukrainian staff. Its proximity to the frontline of fighting has raised international fears of a nuclear disaster. The electricity supply to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine is fragile, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog has said. “The situation with regards to external power continues to be extremely precarious. We do have at the moment external power, but it is, I would say, fragile. There is one line feeding the plant,” said Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, via telephone link from Ukraine. Addressing the Energy Intelligence Forum in London on Wednesday, he added that his itinerary would also take him to Russia for talks. Russia’s foreign ministry said today that it had expelled a Lithuanian diplomat in a retaliatory move. Reuters reports that in a statement posted on its website, the ministry said that it “reserves the right to take additional measures” in response to what it called Lithuania’s “unfriendly steps”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said in televised comments that he signed a decree making “corrections” to the partial mobilisation drive he announced 21 September. Reuters reports that speaking at a meeting with teachers, which was broadcast on state television to mark World Teachers’ Day, Putin said the decree would defer conscription for additional categories of students, including those enrolled at accredited private universities and certain postgraduate students. Reuters has a quick snap that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said at a televised meeting with teachers today that Russia had “great respect” for the Ukrainian people, despite what he called “the current situation”. Referring to the four partly Russian-controlled Ukrainian regions that he declared Russian territory on Friday, Putin said he expected the situation there to “stabilise”. The former spokesperson to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and one of his erstwhile closest confidantes who was present during his only encounter with Vladimir Putin in 2019, has published a book in which she recalls her time working at Zelenskiy’s side, and does not shy away from criticising him. In The Fight of Our Lives: My Time With Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s Battle for Democracy and What It Means for the World, due for print publication in the UK on 27 October, Iuliia Mendel details her former boss’s improbable rise from comedian to president, focusing on the two years she worked with him until the summer 2021. In an interview with the newspaper Bild, to coincide with the German publication of her book, Mendel said that no one in Ukraine had been prepared for war, not even Zelenskiy. But she says she believes Zelenskiy should have acted sooner on intelligence information that an invasion of Ukraine was imminent. “There is of course criticism in Ukraine. People say: ‘If he knew, he should have told people so that they could have been brought to safety.’ I would say it was very unfair not to tell people anything. There is a lot of injustice contained in this behaviour. But if you ask me what I would have done as a leader, then I really don’t know.” Mendel said that much of what Zelenskiy has done since the invasion has been “very natural and intuitive. Very logical and correct.” “I have often been asked about the transition of his image, from the suit to the T-shirt, and whether there were stylists behind the scenes,” she said. But Zelenskiy she insists “made all the decisions himself” and there was “no place for stylists” in the air-raid bunker in which he lived with his core team for weeks on end. Kirill Stremousov, who is one of the leaders in the Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Kherson, has suggested on Telegram that Ukrainian forces have been suffering casualties during their attempt to push down into Kherson. He posted: The big game in the Kherson region continues. For many Ukronazis, this game has already ended on the outskirts. All who come with weapons to the territory of the Kherson region of the Russian Federation will be destroyed. The EU has agreed to set a price cap on Russian oil and ban trade in numerous technical and consumer goods, as part of further sanctions designed to counter Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. The latest round of sanctions, the eighth since February, were signed off by EU ambassadors on Wednesday, a week since the measures were proposed, a time scale regarded as lightning speed in Brussels. EU diplomats confirmed that the bloc had agreed to cap the price of Russian oil, after providing “assurances” to Greece, Cyprus and Malta, countries with large shipping industries. Prior to the agreement, these countries argued the oil price cap should not be imposed by the EU without guarantees that other non-EU countries, such as India, would also sign up to a price cap. The EU oil price cap follows a pledge by the G7 earlier this month. Under plans agreed by the US, Canada, Japan, the UK, France, Germany and Italy, firms shipping and insuring Russian oil will only be able to operate if they adhere to a price below a yet-to-be-determined level. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, welcomed the agreement, saying the EU had moved quickly and decisively. EU officials will be relieved to have secured agreement before two days of summitry in Prague, partly intended as a show of solidarity with Ukraine. Leaders from 44 countries across Europe will meet on Thursday in the Czech capital to discuss security on the continent, followed by an EU summit on Friday where the bloc’s leaders will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Garry Kasparov, the former chess world champion and anti-Putin regime campaigner, has given an interview to the German news magazine Spiegel in which he says that “every Russian who is living in Russia now is part of the war machine” and demands that those who want to stand on the right side of history should leave. Kasparov tells the magazine that he has spent 20 years fighting against Vladimir Putin. “I always said that his regime would unavoidably become a fascist threat – not only for Russia, not only for its neighbours, but for the entire world. It would have been nice if a few more people would have taken this warning to heart.” Asked by Spiegel if being abroad – he has lived in political exile since 2013 – he wasn’t in too comfortable a position to be making such demands of those who have yet to leave Russia, he said: “This is war. Either you’re on one side of the front or the other. Every Russian citizen, including me, carries collective responsibility for this war, even if not a personal responsibility. Today Russia is a fascistic dictatorship, which, while we’re speaking here, is carrying out crimes against humanity. And everyone who is still living in Russia now, is a part of this war machinery, whether he wants to be or not.” Kasparov said Russians who want to be given asylum elsewhere should first have to sign a three-point declaration in which they would “declare the war to be criminal, the Putin regime illegitimate and Ukraine indivisible”, Kasparov said. By signing it, the individual would be liable for prosecution in Russia on three counts according to laws Putin has put in place, he added. The 59-year old chess grandmaster makes the interesting claim that Putin “never played chess, but poker, and he was good at geopolitical poker. He often played with bad cards and won, because his opponents fell for his bluff.” The Financial Times is quoting Ihor Romanenko, a former deputy head of Ukraine’s general staff, on how vital it is that Ukrainian forces are able to make swift progress during this phase of their counter-offensive. The newspaper reports he said: Certainly it is crucial to advance swiftly in liberating occupied territory because there is a sense that changes in the weather will limit further active military actions in this region. If our allies were to help us by providing more of the modern weaponry we are asking for, then the situation would be much swifter and we would not be talking about the factor of weather. Russian news agency RIA is carrying quotes from the deputy foreign minister of Russia Sergei Vershinin confirming that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director general Rafael Grossi will be visiting Moscow. It quotes Vershinin saying: I confirm reports that Grossi is going to come to Kyiv, and then to Moscow. In terms of time, these will be the next few days. Vershinin went on to say: Grossi put forward a number of ideas that are now being discussed with experts. The task is nuclear safety and the exclusion of shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is carried out by the Ukrainian side, and the normal functioning of the nuclear power plant. The IAEA has previously called for a nuclear safety exclusion zone around the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March. Until now it has continued to be operated by staff employed by Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-enterprise which manages the plant. However, the plant sits on land that has now been claimed to be annexed by Russia, and Vershinin said: “The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is now on the territory of the Russian Federation and, accordingly, should be operated under the supervision of our relevant agencies.” Both Russian and Ukraine have accused the other side of shelling the plant and risking a nuclear accident. Reuters is reporting some diplomatic tension between Russia and Kazakhstan over the Ukraine war with Kazakh authorities rejecting a demand from Russia that they expel Ukraine’s ambassador over comments about killing Russians, chiding Moscow for what they called an inappropriate tone between “equal strategic partners”. Ukraine’s ambassador in Astana, Petro Vrublevskiy, said in August in an interview with a local blogger that “the more Russians we kill now, the fewer of them our children will have to kill”. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Tuesday said Moscow was “outraged” by the fact that Vrublevskiy was still in Astana and had summoned the Kazakh ambassador. Kazakh foreign ministry spokesman Aibek Smadiyarov on Wednesday called Zakharova’s tone “discordant with the nature of the allied relations between Kazakhstan and Russia as equal strategic partners”, adding that the Russian ambassador would in turn be summoned to the Kazakh ministry. The British Prime Minister Liz Truss has said that Ukraine “will win” and that no peace deal should give away Ukrainian territory while addressing the annual conference of the UK’s ruling Conservative party in Birmingham. She said: The Ukrainian people aren’t just fighting for their security but for all of our security. This is a fight for freedom and democracy around the world. Putin’s illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory is just the latest act in his campaign to subvert democracy and violate international law. We should not give in to those who want a deal which trades away Ukrainian land. They are proposing to pay in Ukrainian lives for the illusion of peace. We will stand with our Ukrainian friends, however long it takes. Ukraine can win. Ukraine must win. And Ukraine will win. She received one of the warmest rounds of applause of her speech for the section on Ukraine and went on to say that she was sure that Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people would appreciate “our solidarity with them at this very difficult time”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was asked in his regular briefing about the borders of Russia’s claimed annexation. He said: Read the order. There is a legal wording there. In general, of course, there we are talking about the territory in which the military-civilian administration operated at the time of admission [to Russia]. But I repeat once again: certain territories there will be returned, and we will continue to consult with the population that expresses a desire to live with Russia. The state-owned Tass news agency reported earlier: New regions within Russia will retain the status of republics and regions and their former names. According to the documents, the boundaries of the regions will be determined by their borders, which “existed on the day of their formation and acceptance into the Russian Federation”. The territory of the DPR and LPR is defined by the 2014 borders established in their constitutions. Zaporizhzhia is part of the Russian Federation within its administrative boundaries, and Kherson region - with two districts of the Mykolaiv region, explained the head of the State Duma Committee on State Building and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov. The Kremlin said this morning that there was no contradiction between incorporating Ukrainian territories into the Russian Federation and military retreats, saying that Moscow would press ahead with its plans to annex four Ukrainian regions. “They will be with Russia forever and they will be returned,” Reuters reports Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the media. President Vladimir Putin formalised the annexation of the four Ukrainian regions – around 18% of Ukraine’s territory – this morning despite a series of major battlefield reversals in recent days shrinking the amount of seized territory Moscow can say it actually controls. Russian forces lost a vast numbers of tanks during the first few months of the war, prompting questions over whether they were becoming obsolete. But the tank has previously appeared to have been consigned to the ash heap of history only to rise again to reaffirm its relevance. Josh Toussaint-Strauss examines for the Guardian Russia’s early deployment during the invasion and asks: if tanks aren’t the problem, why did they fail in Ukraine? Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed the four laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four areas, and it remains unclear where Russia is attempting to set its new external border. Ukraine has made major and rapid advances this week, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying in an address on Tuesday night that “dozens” of towns have been recaptured. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, and in the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. Pro-Russian leaders in the occupied regions have claimed that the situation is stabilising this morning. Denis Pushilin, installed as governor in Donetsk by Russia has said “the situation on the front line in the Lyman direction is stabilising, the defence line is being strengthened”, while Kirill Stremousov, part of the occupation administration imposed on Kherson, has been quoted saying that Russian forces were “conducting a regrouping in order to gather their strength and deliver a retaliatory blow” in the region, and “the advance of the armed forces of Ukraine in the Kherson direction has stopped”.

This is Martin Belam in London, and I will be with you for the next few hours. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com The BBC’s Orla Guerin earlier published some pictures from her recent visit to areas that have been liberated from Russian occupation, saying: “The Russians are gone but there is damage that can never be undone, and the dead cannot be restored to life.” There are another couple of quotes on Telegram from sources within the Russian-occupied Donetsk region from Denis Pushilin, who is Russia’s acting governor in the territory it has claimed to annex there. He has said that “the situation on the frontline in the Lyman direction is stabilising, the defence line is being strengthened”, and that “we see that Ukrainian armed forces are now seriously supplemented by brigades that were trained in Nato countries, this must be taken into account”. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant will operate under the supervision of Russian agencies after Russia claimed to have formally annexed the wider Zaporizhzhia region, the RIA state-owned news agency reported. Reuters reports that another state-owned news agency, Tass, carried news that Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the earliest days of the war. Tass is also reporting that Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-imposed acting “governor” of Zaporizhzhia said that yesterday “there were about 40 strikes on the outskirts and the city of Enerhodar”, which houses the nuclear power plant. “Yesterday was pretty hot for us,” he added. Sir Andrew Wood, former British ambassador to Yugoslavia and Russia, and an associate fellow of the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House, was interviewed in the UK on Sky News earlier about the situation in Ukraine. He said he believed Vladimir Putin had made a “fatal error” with the partial mobilisation, which had bought the war closer to home, and was “chaotically ill-done”. He said he expected fighting to continue well into next year but raised doubts about whether Russia would escalate the conflict to a nuclear level. He said: Nobody in the west wants to get involved in a nuclear exchange. I don’t think anybody in the Russian Federation would want to be involved in a nuclear exchange, except possibly President Putin. The whole trouble with Russia is everything is being decided by one man who hides from discussion, who hides from other possible views, that interferes in military undertakings by issuing direct orders to the commanders on the field and has thoroughly muddled up the whole situation. Russian TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, famous for staging an on-air protest against Russia’s war in Ukraine, confirmed she had escaped house arrest over charges of spreading fake news again, saying she had no case to answer. “I consider myself completely innocent, and since our state refuses to comply with its own laws, I refuse to comply with the measure of restraint imposed on me as of 30 September 2022 and release myself from it,” Reuters reports she said on Telegram. Ovsyannikova, 44, was given two months’ house arrest in August over a protest in July when she stood on a river embankment opposite the Kremlin and held up a poster calling President Vladimir Putin a murderer and his soldiers fascists. She faced a sentence of up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of the charge of spreading fake news about Russia’s armed forces. If you missed it overnight, my colleague Peter Beaumont has been in the recently liberated city of Lyman, and sent this dispatch: Occupied until last week by soldiers of the Russian 20th Combined Arms army and Bars-13 troops from the Russian Guard – some of whom had earlier retreated from Kharkiv province – when the attack came they were quickly trapped in a rapidly closing encirclement as the villages outside the city, set among rolling hills, were rapidly rolled up. What is clear is that Ukraine’s military has found a way of fighting that is far more deft and flexible than the Russians – who are heavily reliant on their creaking supply lines – deploying quickly to cut off, encircle and destroy units piece by piece. And those Russians who stayed to fight were obliterated by shells and missile fire. Or shot in the forests. At a junction of a level crossing and a road, the trees around a Russian trench have been swept down as if by a giant hand, the road littered with artillery casings, bits of uniform and human remains. Surveying the scene, “Flagman”, a Ukrainian officer who has fought in this sector since Russia launched its invasion in February, said that while the Russians relied on the roads, the Ukrainians ambushed them from these woods. Read more of Peter Beaumont’s report from Lyman: ‘What was it all for?’: recaptured Lyman left shattered by Russian occupation Russia’s RIA Novosti has some further quotes from Vladimir Rogov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in occupied Zaporizhzhia. It quotes him saying: “The situation on the line of contact remains stably tense. The counter-battery fight continues.” Another of the Russian-imposed leaders in the regions the Russian Federation is claiming to annex in occupied Ukraine, Kirill Stremousov of Kherson, has been quoted saying that Russian forces were “conducting a regrouping in order to gather their strength and deliver a retaliatory blow” in the region. Denis Pushilin, another Russian-imposed leader, has also been reported by RIA as saying that Ukrainian forces are in the retreat in Bakhmut, “without the ability to hold its previously occupied positions”. None of the claims have been independently verified. Roland Oliphant, who is a senior foreign correspondent at the Telegraph , has suggested that much of what happens next in the war depends on whether the current Russian retreat is being carried out in good order back to sound defensive lines, which he says is how it is being described by some Russian sources, or whether it is a rout, as described by some Ukrainian voices. He suggests: It seems to me an awful lot depends on this, because the former may mean a winter stalemate and Russia staying in the war for the time being. The latter – a third disaster in a month and a snowball to general defeat that may be impossible to stop. However, he also cautions that “you may as well read a horoscope” as try to predict the outcome, saying: “I would advise you not to trust anyone who claims to know either way this morning. Everyone, with the exception of Ukrainian and Russian commands, is reading tea-leaves through the news blackout and Telegram.” Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, a region which today Russia has claimed to annex under Russian law, has issued a status update on Telegram. He says: The enemy fired rockets at the regional centre and the outskirts of the city. Infrastructure facilities were destroyed. Information about victims is being clarified. The anti-aircraft defence forces have worked. If you see unexploded munitions, don’t disturb it, do not come close, do not take pictures. Report the find to the rescuers. French junior minister for European affairs Laurence Boone has clarified the situation in which Russians fleeing the partial mobilisation for the war in Ukraine can obtain visas to stay in France. Reuters quotes her telling Franceinfo radio: “We have limited conditions under which visas can be given. We will make sure dissident journalists, people who fight the regime, artists and students can still come here, and we will issue visas on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the security risks.” Kirill Stremousov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in Ukraine’s Kherson region, has told the Russian Tass news agency that “the advance of the armed forces of Ukraine in the Kherson direction has stopped”. The claim has not been independently verified, and the news agency has provided no further details. It won’t come as a huge surprise to learn that Denis Pushilin, who had been acting as the self-declared leader of the chiefly unrecognised Donetsk People’s Republic, and who was in Moscow for Vladimir Putin’s annexation ceremony last week, has been immediately named as the Russian president’s choice to lead the Donetsk region as it is absorbed into the Russian Federation by Russian law. The Telegram channel of the Donetsk People’s Republic has published an image of the law. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed the four laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four areas. Russian state media Tass is reporting that the documents have been published now that Putin has signed them. It says: The boundaries of the new subjects of the Federation, as follows from the treaties, will be determined by the boundaries that “existed on the day of their formation and acceptance into the Russian Federation”. Until the election of the heads of the new regions, in accordance with Russian law, they will be led by temporary acting officials appointed by Putin. Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency is reporting the words of Vladimir Rogov, an official in the Russian-imposed administration in occupied Zaporizhzhia. He is claiming that Ukraine will stage a “provocation” at the Dnipro hydroelectric power station (DHP). It quotes him: Extremely unhealthy activity has been observed in relation to the DHP in the city of Zaporizhzhia, temporarily under the control of the Zelenskiy regime. The information we receive cannot but cause concern for the fate of our native land. The Kyiv authorities understand that Zaporizhzhia is both de facto and de jure already Russia, and the liberation of the rest of the Zaporizhzhia region is only a matter of time. So, while waiting for our offensive, according to their plan, the DHP can become the object of a provocation in order to blame Russia for everything. Rogov produced no evidence to back up his claims, but cited an exercise carried out in 2018 which simulated what would happen if the dam was breached, claiming that it would unleash “a 20-metre wave covering the coastal part of the city at a speed of over 60km per hour”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted a series of images across social media from recently liberated Lyman, with the message: Our Lyman after the occupier. All basics of life have been destroyed here. They are doing so everywhere in the territories they seize. This can be stopped in one way only: liberate Ukraine, life, humanity, law and truth as soon as possible. Vitaliy Kim, Ukraine’s governor of Mykolaiv, has posted his daily status update on Telegram, which lists Russian shelling across a number of settlements within his region. He says that nobody was injured overnight, but there was damage yesterday to infrastructure facilities in Voznesensk. The claims have not been independently verified.

The UK ministry of defence has published its daily intelligence update on the war, reporting that “Ukraine continues to make progress in offensive operations along both the north-eastern and southern fronts. In the north-east, in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine has now consolidated a substantial area of territory east of the Oskil River.” The other developments included in the report were: Ukrainian formations have advanced up to 20km beyond the river into Russia’s defensive zone towards the supply node of the town of Svatove. It is highly likely that Ukraine can now strike the key Svatove-Kremina road with most of its artillery systems, further straining Russia’s ability to resupply its units in the east. Politically, Russian leaders will highly likely be concerned that leading Ukrainian units are now approaching the borders of Luhansk Oblast, which Russia claimed to have formally annexed last Friday. There are major questions over the prospects of the “European Political Community” summit being launched in Prague on Thursday, AFP reports. The one-day gathering , the brainchild of French President Emmanuel Macron, will bring together the 27 European Union leaders with those from the broader neighbourhood, including Britain, Turkey and Ukraine. Brussels has billed the initiative as an invaluable “platform for political coordination” among the disparate grouping of 44 nations invited. But there are deep disagreements, among some of those attending and scepticism that the one-day event will turn out to be much more than a glorified photo opportunity. Russia was not invited and Zelenskiy will connect via video link from Kyiv. His prime minister will stand in for him at the talks. “The ambition is to bring leaders together on an equal footing and to foster political dialogue and cooperation on issues of common interest so that, together, we work on strengthening the security, stability and prosperity of Europe as a whole,” EU chief Charles Michel said in his invitation letter. As speculation mounts ahead of Friday’s Nobel peace prize announcement, observers suggest the committee may sound the alarm over the war in Ukraine, AFP reports. Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), suggested the Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, saying they deserved to win the prestigious honour together. “These are both champions of non-violent pro-democracy activities within their own countries,” he said. “And both Navalny and Tikhanovskaya have also been very strong opponents of the war in Ukraine”. Meanwhile, a price cap for Russian oil proposed as part of the European Union’s eighth round of sanctions against Russia will not apply to pipeline shipments, Hungary‘s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said in a statement late on Tuesday. Hungary, which has been the most vocal critic of sanctions against Russia in the EU, largely relies on Russian crude shipments and Russian gas, both imported via pipelines. Major oil producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia are set to meet today, as reports say they are mulling an output cut of up to 2m barrels per day in a bid to prop up slumping prices. If implemented, it will be the first such major cut since a landmark curb on production at the start of the Covid pandemic. Energy prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, pushing inflation to decades-high levels that have put pressure on economies across the world. But they have fallen in recent months on concerns over dwindling demand and a slowdown in the global economy. The 13 members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, and their 10 allies headed by Russia will hold their first in-person meeting since March 2020 at the group’s headquarters in Vienna. Here is the latest on nuclear concerns in the conflict: The United States has no indication that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict, despite “nuclear sabre-rattling” by Putin, according to the White House press secretary. An unnamed Western diplomat told Reuters that NATO has not warned alliance members of any Russian nuclear threat. And the Kremlin said it did not want to take part in “nuclear rhetoric” spread by the West after a British media report that Russia was preparing to demonstrate its willingness to use nuclear weapons in its conflict with Ukraine. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, says Washington’s decision to send more military aid to Ukraine poses a threat to Moscow’s interests and increases the risk of a military clash between Russia and the West. “We perceive this as an immediate threat to the strategic interests of our country,” Antonov said on the Telegram messaging app on Wednesday. “The supply of military products by the US and its allies not only entails protracted bloodshed and new casualties, but also increases the danger of a direct military clash between Russia and Western countries.” In case you missed this earlier, Ukraine may restart the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, to ensure its safety, the president of the company that operates the plant told the Associated Press on Tuesday. The potential restart comes weeks after there were escalating fears of a radiation disaster at the Russian-occupied facility. Energoatom, the Ukranian state nuclear company, shut down the plant’s six remaining reactors on 11 September amid fighting in the area. Russian military activity had cut off power supplies for safety systems, raising fears of a meltdown, the AP noted. But Energoatom president Petro Kotin told the AP today that the company may restart two of the reactors in the coming days to “protect safety installations as winter approaches and temperatures drop”. Kotin said: If you have low temperature, you will just freeze everything inside. The safety equipment will be damaged. So you need heating and the only heating is going to come from the working reactor.” Even with the reactors shut down, damage to the systems or failures due to cold weather could still lead to catastrophe, the company’s president said, adding, “You have residual heat and you should constantly provide the coolant for these fuel assemblies. If you stop cooling, then you will have meltdown. And that is how it works … We, at the moment, are evaluating all the risks. And this depends on the weather. And actually, we don’t have much time to do that.” Ukraine has made major and rapid advances this week, with Zelensky saying in an address on Tuesday that “dozens” of towns have been recaptured. Here is a roundup of what has happened on the battlefield, via Reuters: Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, according to the Russian-installed head of the administration of occupied areas in the province. Russian military bloggers described a Ukrainian tank advance through dozens of kilometres of territory along the west bank of the Dnipro. Kyiv has maintained almost complete silence about the situation in Kherson. In the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. The pro-Russian leader in Donetsk said forces were forming a new defensive line around the town of Kreminna. Russia has meanwhile sacked the commander of its Western military district, news outlet RBC reported. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the latest for the next few hours. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced on Tuesday that dozens of regions in Ukraine have been liberated from Russian occupation. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, according to the Russian-installed head of the administration of occupied areas in the province. In the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. The pro-Russian leader in Donetsk said forces were forming a new defensive line around the town of Kreminna. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments. Ukraine may restart the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, to ensure its safety, the president of the company that operates the plant told the Associated Press today. The potential restart comes weeks after there were escalating fears of a radiation disaster at the Russian-occupied facility. Ukraine’s economy will shrink at a rate eight times that of Russia’s this year as a result of the war triggered by Moscow’s invasion in February, the World Bank has estimated. Russia is at risk of losing control of the strategic towns critical to retaining the city of Kherson and eventually Crimea, western officials said, but they warned the fighting along the Dnieper river “will not be an easy rush into constrained territory”. The upper house of Russia’s parliament voted on Tuesday to approve the incorporation of four occupied Ukrainian regions into Russia, as Moscow sets about formally annexing territory it seized from Kyiv since staging its latest invasion of Ukraine in February. In a session on Tuesday, the Federation Council unanimously ratified legislation to annex the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, after a similar vote in the state Duma, Russia’s lower house. No lawmakers in the lower house voted against the bill either. Russia, however, no longer has full control of any of the four provinces it claims to have annexed, after Ukrainian troops reportedly advanced dozens of kilometres in Kherson province. The Russian military has acknowledged that Kyiv’s forces had broken through in the Kherson region. It said the Ukrainian army and its “superior tank units” had managed to “penetrate the depths of our defence” around the villages of Zoltaya Balka and Alexsandrovka. Zelenskiy has signed a decree declaring the prospect of any Ukrainian talks with Vladimir Putin “impossible”. The decree formalised comments made by Zelenskiy on Friday after the Russian president proclaimed the four occupied regions of Ukraine were to become part of Russia. Russia’s retreat from Lyman has sparked vociferous criticism of the handling of the war on Russian state television. Vladimir Solovyov, host of a primetime talkshow on state TV channel Russia 1 and one of the Kremlin’s biggest cheerleaders, said on air on Sunday: “We need to pull it together, make unpopular, but necessary decisions and act.” The Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) will restore its network to oppose the partial mobilisation aimed at bolstering Russia’s forces in Ukraine, close Navalny ally Ivan Zhdanov said in a video published on social media. Russian authorities have designated Alexei Navalny’s organisations “extremist” after months of increasing repression against his supporters, putting FBK employees, volunteers and sympathisers at risk of prosecution and imprisonment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/01/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-190-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T18:22:58Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 190 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-190-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-190-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 190 of the invasion","bodyText":"UN inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after being delayed for several hours by conflicting reports of shelling around Europe’s biggest atomic facility. Rafael Grossi, the chief international nuclear inspector, said he saw “the key things I needed to see” and his team was able to gather “a lot of information” during the long-awaited visit. “We have achieved something very important today and the important thing is the IAEA is staying here – let the world know that the IAEA is staying at Zaporizhzhia,” Grossi said in a video from Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency. The plant’s operator, Energoatom, said Grossi had left the site. Five IAEA representatives would remain, probably until Saturday. Grossi said his team would maintain a “continued presence”. Energoatom said early on Thursday that it had activated emergency procedures and shut down one of the facility’s two working reactors “as a result of another mortar shelling by Russian … forces at the site”. Ukrainian authorities are making “all efforts” to switch the plant’s fifth reactor back on, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear company said later. The Red Cross issued an urgent call for an end to all military operations around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, warning the consequences of a strike could be “catastrophic”. It was “high time to stop playing with fire and instead take concrete measures” to protect the plant from any military operations, director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Robert Mardini, said. The stakes were “immense”, he added. The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, accused Moscow of trying to wreck the inspection of the nuclear facility, saying Russia was acting like a terrorist state. “It is Russia that is responsible for everything happening at the plant,” he said. Russia claimed it repulsed an attempt by Ukrainian forces to sabotage or retake the plant. It said a small number of Ukrainian troops launched two amphibious attacks. It also alleged that Ukrainian fire came within 400 metres of the plant. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said: “We are doing everything to ensure that this station is safe, that it functions safely. And for the mission there to carry out all its plans.” Lavrov has warned Moldova that any actions seen as endangering the security of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transnistria would be considered an attack on Russia. Russia has had peacekeeping troops stationed in Transnistria since the early 1990s, when pro-Russia separatists wrested most of the region from Moldovan control. Ukraine’s counteroffensive to reclaim Kherson has not stalled or failed, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy has said. “It is carried out in a planned manner. We destroy enemy logistics, air defence systems, fuel and ammunition depots,” Oleksiy Arestovych said, adding: “There will be no quick wins.” Ukraine’s armed forces struck strategic bridges in the southern Kherson region to isolate Russian troops located on the right bank of the Dnieper, Arestovych said. Ukraine’s defence ministry said the Kakhovsky and Daryiv bridges, used by Russia to transport equipment and ammunition to the region, have been “disabled”. Thursday marked the return to school for many children in Ukraine, with face-to-face teaching resuming in some locations. Zelenskiy visited a school in Irpin that had been reconstructed after it was partially destroyed earlier in the year. Finland has said it will provide €8.3m in further defence aid to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin visited the open coffin of the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, on Thursday. The Russian president laid flowers at Moscow’s central clinical hospital, where Gorbachev died earlier this week aged 91. The Kremlin said Putin would not attend Gorbachev’s funeral this weekend because of schedule constraints. Russian forces have been forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians to Russia or areas of Ukraine under their control, according to Human Rights Watch. Forced transfers are “a serious violation of the laws of war that constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity”, HRW said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/05/turbines-are-an-eyesore-sounds-like-a-wind-up","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-05T16:44:37Z","webTitle":"Turbines are an eyesore?

Dr Michael Symonds Loughborough • Amid talk of increased nuclear, solar and wind power, there seems to be a deafening silence about tidal power. This is neither dangerous nor dependent on fickle wind or sunshine. It capitalises on the UK’s large tidal ranges and costs about the same as nuclear power.

Acknowledging he would have to increase government borrowing to tackle the crisis, the former chancellor sketched out what he envisaged would be a support package for up to 16 million vulnerable people. “People need reassurance now about what we will do and I make no apology for concentrating on what matters most,” Sunak wrote in the Times, which reported that he valued a cut to VAT on energy at £5bn. He was also said to have pledged to find the same amount again to go towards helping those most in need, as he said: “You can’t heat your home with hope.” It comes after Sunak claimed Liz Truss’s cost-of-living plans could put vulnerable people at risk of “real destitution”, with economic policy once again driving a wedge between the candidates. As Sunak and Truss took to the stage for the latest Tory party hustings in Cheltenham, Sunak refused to rule out “some limited and temporary one-off borrowing as a last resort to get us through this winter”. He also said that without further direct payments, pensioners and people on very low incomes could face serious hardship. However, the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, who is supporting Truss, hit back on Friday morning, taking a veiled swipe at Sunak for not waiting for the energy regulator Ofgem to make a key announcement about the energy price cap before his latest intervention. Defending Truss, Coffey said: “She is absolutely an MP who knowns what it is like for struggling households and that is why, quite rightly in a considered way, once Ofgem comes up with their price cap … all of government … and it will be decision for the new prime minister to enact what changes could be made.” Referring to Sunak, she said: “I appreciate what he is saying that but Ofgem has not reported. When he was chancellor he waited for Ofgem to report before coming up with some proposals.” Coffey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that she had delivered that previous support through legislation and at the time had been “blocked within government” when she asked for powers to make payments more quickly. “I have delivered that through legislation and at the time I asked for powers to be able to make payments more quickly. That was not given to me. That was blocked within government so if we are going to do things through the welfare system we would have to do brand new primary legislation,” she said. Sunak’s comments in Thursday’s hustings came after Truss, in her own Q&amp;A session at the event, reiterated her belief that tax cuts should be the main response to soaring bills. Truss told the audience of Tory members that this would always be her “first port of call”, followed by a focus on longer-term energy supply issues such as support for fracking and nuclear power. Truss said she could provide other assistance, but gave no details, saying she “can’t write the chancellor’s budget” before even being elected as prime minister. “If the answer to every question is raising tax, we will choke off economic growth, and we will send ourselves to penury, and I think that’s a massive problem,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/oct/11/uk-to-designate-china-a-threat-in-hawkish-foreign-policy-shift","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-11T17:58:50Z","webTitle":"UK to designate China a ‘threat’ in hawkish foreign policy shift ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/11/uk-to-designate-china-a-threat-in-hawkish-foreign-policy-shift","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/oct/11/uk-to-designate-china-a-threat-in-hawkish-foreign-policy-shift","fields":{"headline":"UK to designate China a ‘threat’ in hawkish foreign policy shift ","bodyText":"China is to be formally designated a “threat” to Britain in a hasty rewrite of Boris Johnson’s defence and foreign policy that is being brought forward to end confusion among ministers about how to deal with Beijing. Under Johnson, China had been categorised as a “systemic competitor” but the new prime minister, Liz Truss, wants to take a more hawkish stance quickly, as she seeks to shore up support for her faltering premiership on her backbenches. The redesignation will bring the UK’s official position towards China close to its stance on Russia, currently classed as “the most acute threat” facing the UK. But it is almost certain to provoke a hostile reaction from Beijing. It had been intended to complete the policy rewrite at the end of the year, but sources said a special China strategy review was now being brought forward after the Department for Education was forced into a climbdown by No 10 over the weekend after expressing support for China’s Confucius Institutes. One insider said the change could come “within days”. Influential Conservative backbenchers on Tuesday night welcomed the anticipated move. Iain Duncan Smith, who is campaigning to be chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said a hardening of the UK’s China policy was long overdue. “It is time we stopped messing around and recognised that China poses a threat to the way we live our lives, and it is time now to treat them in the same way we treat Russia,” the former party leader said. The DfE had issued a statement expressing support for China’s 30 Confucius Institutes, which promote the teaching of Chinese language and culture in the UK – only for Downing St to demand it made a firmer response. The revised statement said the “UK government is committed to doing more to adapt to China’s growing impact” and encouraged anybody with concerns about any of the Confucius Institute’s activities to report them. A report by the Henry Jackson Society thinktank had concluded most of the institutes were engaged in activities beyond their formal remit, including political lobbying and expanding China’s reach into advanced manufacturing. Truss has adopted a hawkish stance on China for some time – at one point leading opposition within the cabinet to TikTok moving its global headquarters to London – but her predecessor in Downing St was insistent on a more nuanced approach. In a private meeting Johnson once described himself as “fervently Sinophile”, a position out of kilter with many on the Conservative benches, who have been lobbying for a tougher approach for the fast few years. Britain’s stance towards China has swung dramatically in less than a decade, from the “golden era” proclaimed by David Cameron in 2015, the year in which its president, Xi Jinping, was granted a state visit to the UK. Beijing signalled it was keen to invest in strategic industries in Britain, such as nuclear power. But as Xi adopted a more authoritarian tone at home, concern among Conservatives grew, fuelled further by the desire of both the Trump and Biden administrations in the US to strike a more assertive approach in their dealings with Beijing. Pressure from the US and Conservative MPs had forced Johnson into a U-turn over Chinese telecoms equipment supplier Huawei in July 2020 over 5G. Huawei kit was banned from UK networks from 2027, although it was accompanied by a warning that this would delay 5G rollout by three years and cost an extra £7bn. The previous definition of China was contained in the Integrated Review of defence and foreign policy published in March 2021, which sought to balance concerns about China’s authoritarian government with the need to collaborate on economic and climate issues. It was intended to set the tone for Britain’s global strategy for the next five years, but like many Johnson-era policies has been rapidly recast by Truss in her first weeks in government. Downing Street said the prime minister had commissioned an update to the Integrated Review partly in response to an increasingly aggressive China. “As she has said, Russia remains the biggest threat to the UK but China represents the most serious long-term threat to our values and way of life,” a spokesperson added. Earlier on Tuesday Jeremy Fleming, the head of spy agency GCHQ, said Beijing’s efforts to exploit control and surveillance capabilities in emerging technologies such as satellite location systems and digital currencies represents “a threat to us all”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/11/truss-tax-plans-could-put-millions-at-risk-of-real-destitution-says-sunak","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-11T21:03:34Z","webTitle":"Truss tax plans could put millions at risk of ‘real destitution’, says Sunak","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/11/truss-tax-plans-could-put-millions-at-risk-of-real-destitution-says-sunak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/11/truss-tax-plans-could-put-millions-at-risk-of-real-destitution-says-sunak","fields":{"headline":"Truss tax plans could put millions at risk of ‘real destitution’, says Sunak","bodyText":"Liz Truss’s tax cut-based approach to the energy crisis risks putting millions of Britons in “real destitution”, Rishi Sunak has warned, as the Conservative leadership candidates again clashed bitterly over economic policy. The hustings event on Thursday in Cheltenham, a key Tory-held marginal seat, also saw the foreign secretary effectively rule out any increased windfall tax on energy firm profits, as she hit out at the “depressing” sight of fields used for solar power. Sunak’s vehement comments came after Truss, in her own Q&amp;A session at the event, reiterated her belief that tax cuts should be the main response to soaring bills. Truss told the audience of Tory members this would always be her “first port of call”, followed by a focus on longer-term energy supply issues such as support for fracking and nuclear power. Also promising she would not call an election before 2024, Truss said she could provide other assistance, but gave no details, saying she “can’t write the chancellor’s budget” before even being elected as prime minister. “If the answer to every question is raising tax, we will choke off economic growth, and we will send ourselves to penury, and I think that’s a massive problem,” she argued. Speaking after her, Sunak castigated Truss for what he said was a lack of action to help people who would not benefit from her planned reduction in national insurance contributions, including pensioners and those not in work. “We are going to, as a Conservative government, leave millions of incredibly vulnerable people at the risk of real destitution,” the former chancellor said. “And I think that’s a real moral failure.” To do this would mean “the country will never, ever forgive us”, he added. Truss also said she would “absolutely” not support a wider windfall tax, saying: “I don’t think profit is a dirty word.” She added: “I think it’s a Labour idea. It’s all about bashing business, and it sends the wrong message to international investors and to the public.” Asked about an early election, she pledged: “I will not have an election before 2024. I think that’s a very important point, because we’ve got to deliver for people.” Quizzed about agricultural land, Truss hit out at its use for solar panels: “I think one of the most depressing sights when you’re driving through England is seeing fields that should be full of crops or livestock, full of solar panels.” She added: “I’m not against solar panels per se. There are plenty of commercial roofs in Britain where we could be putting solar panels. But where they shouldn’t be is on agricultural land that should be used for food production.” Sunak, widely seen as lagging well behind Truss among Tory members, pitched his appeal as a PM who could appeal to floating voters. Cheltenham is currently held by Tory MP Alex Chalk, who introduced Sunak, but with a majority of less than 1,000 over the Liberal Democrats. Asked how he could win over waverers, Sunak explicitly contrasted his style against that of Boris Johnson: “What they want is a government that works competently, seriously, with decency and integrity at the heart of everything it does. “That’s the kind of government I’m going to lead, and that’s how we’re going to win the election.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-05T14:34:04Z","webTitle":"Cold snap poses first test of Britain’s efforts to prevent winter power cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Cold snap poses first test of Britain’s efforts to prevent winter power cuts","bodyText":"As the first big snowfall of winter threatens to drop this week, it’s not only the forecasters and road gritters who will be twitchy: Britain’s energy executives and policymakers are on tenterhooks. Many Britons who have held off putting on the heating, afraid of the bulging bills that could follow, may be forced to nudge the thermostat up, putting a strain on the country’s power supplies. National Grid has warned that a confluence of scenarios including a cold snap and a cut-off of Russian gas to Europe could lead to power cuts. Is this the first piece of that grim jigsaw? An initial assessment appears far more positive than two months ago. Other European countries have filled their gas storage facilities more rapidly than expected, meaning UK competition for supplies has reduced. In fact, Europe’s storage is so full, some tankers carrying liquified natural gas (LNG) have even been idling in European waters, waiting for prices to bounce back. Mother Nature has also played a part: the mild start to winter reduced demand, with some bosses reporting consumption had fallen more than 10% on last year. But while temperatures have been unseasonably warm, wind speeds have been more concerning. Last week dunkelflaute (German for a “dark lull”) conditions – with barely any wind or solar power available to generate electricity on grey, still days – left gas as a key power source. National Grid data showed the fossil fuel was responsible for as much as 60% of Great Britain’s electricity generation for much of last week, far higher than its average of about 40% at this time of year, while wind was only 7%. The conditions were concerning enough for National Grid to flirt with using its demand flexibility service, which incentivises businesses and consumers to shift their power usage, although ultimately it stopped short. Freezing conditions predicted in Europe for mid-December are also driving sentiment. Gas accounted for 49% of electricity generation on Monday, while wind was far healthier than last week at 25%, with nuclear and biomass providing a steady 12% and 6% behind that. However, the cold weather was enough to get energy traders moving – the price of gas for delivery on Tuesday rose 6% to 340p, nearing a three-month high set earlier this month. Rising prices also have implications for the government’s energy price guarantee, which covers the cost for suppliers between wholesale prices and a fixed cost. The higher gas prices are, the bigger the eventual bill for the government. Nathan Piper, an oil and gas analyst at Investec, says: “It could have been a false dawn thinking we had sorted out the gas issue earlier in autumn. If we get cold and still winter conditions there could still be issues – that’s why we have seen gas prices go up.” He says market watchers now believe gas prices will peak next winter, because of the uncertainty over how Europe will replace the six months of significant Russian gas supplies that were available this year. One of Britain’s strengths is its diversity of energy supplies: gas from the North Sea and Norway, and LNG from around the globe, notably the US and Qatar. In electricity, there is wind and solar, nuclear, biomass – particularly from the heavily subsidised Drax power station in North Yorkshire – and a small amount of coal. Government efforts to boost supplies this winter have included paying to keep coal units set for retirement on standby. (These have not yet been exercised). The revived gas storage facilities at Centrica’s Rough – shut down after the government refused to support it – have also been called into action, although Britain’s gas storage is far lower than other European countries. A factor to watch will be the role of interconnectors – the vast undersea cables carrying gas and electricity to and from Britain, Belgium and France. Britain has built goodwill over the summer, providing LNG to Europe; however, any suggestion France could be short of energy supplies this winter could test relations already dented by Brexit. Although France was not as reliant as its neighbours on Russian gas, problems getting several nuclear power stations back online after maintenance have reduced its electricity production. If Emmanuel Macron’s government limited supplies to Britain to protect its own citizens, it would risk a valuable long-term relationship (upcoming World Cup quarter-finals notwithstanding). “It may not come down to resource nationalism,” Piper says. “If France doesn’t have the power to export, then the situation could get tight.” Issues with hydroelectric power imports from Norway this year have also caused concern. The prospect of snowy conditions will also train minds on a much-debated £18m government campaign to encourage households to cut their energy usage. The debate over whether to launch a public information campaign has pitched Conservative ideology over “nanny state intervention” against practical calls to save energy and money. It is expected before Christmas, months after similar drives in elsewhere in Europe, which have led to a 15% cut in consumption. Simon Virley, a vice-chair and the head of energy and natural resources at KPMG, says: “As we approach the first significant cold snap of the winter, improving energy efficiency and reducing demand couldn’t be more important – both to get bills down and to ensure people can heat their homes properly. “The government has now signed off an energy efficiency campaign but the overall aim of getting demand down by 15% by 2030 is less ambitious than in many European countries which are already on course to achieve that this winter.” Snowfall this week could prove the energy industry’s first big test of an extraordinary winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/01/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-281-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-01T01:11:36Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 281 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/01/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-281-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/01/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-281-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 281 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine’s military said Russia had pulled some troops from towns on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Kherson city, the first official Ukrainian report of a Russian withdrawal on the main frontline in the south. The statement gave only limited details and made no mention of any Ukrainian forces having crossed the Dnipro. Ukrainian officials also stressed that Russia had intensified shelling across the river, knocking out power again in Kherson where electricity had only begun to be restored nearly three weeks after Russian troops vacated the city and fled across the river. An investigation is under way into a suspected letter bomb sent to the US embassy in Madrid. It would be the sixth after five were sent to the Ukrainian embassy, Spanish politicians, a Spanish airbase and a company that makes rocket launchers on Wednesday. Spanish police confirmed to the Reuters news agency that an envelope similar to the previous letter bombs had been intercepted at the embassy. A private energy company in Ukraine has said that 40% of the country’s power infrastructure is damaged, as Russian attacks continue to target the supply. Millions have been without or with intermittent power since October, as Russia has focused its attacks on Ukraine’s energy system. As Ukrainians wake up on the first official day of winter, nearly 6 million people across a majority of Ukraine’s regions have no electricity, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday night. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said nine people had been killed in fires, after breaking safety rules in an attempt to heat their homes after Russian attacks on power facilities. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said that it was impossible to discuss nuclear arms control while the war in Ukraine continues, claiming the “western involvement” must not be ignored. Lavrov said that the US was trying to break up Russia, and that it was “naive” to think talks could take place while this happened. Ukraine dismissed the deputy chief engineer of its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, accusing him of collaborating with Moscow’s forces and treason, the Energoatom state nuclear energy company said. The statement was published a day after Russia said it had promoted the engineer, Yuriy Chernichuk, to serve as the director of the vast nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine. The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, has urged China’s top leaders to use their influence over Russia to end the war in Ukraine. Michel, who chairs EU leader summits, held talks with Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on Thursday, in the first face-to-face encounter between the head of an EU institution and China’s top officials since the start of the pandemic. Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz has said that Europe should go back to its prewar “peace order” with Russia if Russian president Vladimir Putin will renounce aggression against his neighbours, according to a report in the Times of his comments at a security conference in Berlin. The US army awarded a $1.2bn contract to Raytheon Technologies Co for six national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (Nasams) for Ukraine on Wednesday, the Pentagon said. The United States has approved sending Ukraine a total of eight Nasams to help fend off Russian missile and drone attacks. Russia said on Thursday the German parliament’s move to recognise the 1932-33 famine in Ukraine as a Soviet-imposed genocide was an anti-Russian provocation and an attempt by Germany to whitewash its Nazi past. In a decision welcomed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, German lawmakers passed a resolution on Wednesday declaring the death by starvation of millions of Ukrainians – the Holodomor – was genocide. Another PoW exchange will take place later on Thursday between Russia and Ukraine. Fifty prisoners of war will be handed over in the latest swap between the two sides. The UN appealed for record funds for aid next year, AFP reports, as the Ukraine war and other conflicts, climate emergencies and the still-simmering pandemic push more people into crisis, and some towards famine. The United Nations’ annual Global Humanitarian Overview estimated that 339 million people worldwide will need some form of emergency assistance next year – a staggering 65 million more people than the estimate a year ago. France has become the first major western state to publicly back the creation of a special tribunal to try senior Russian officials – potentially including Vladimir Putin – for the crime of aggression in Ukraine. Russian forces tried to advance in eastern Ukraine and trained tank, mortar and artillery fire on Kherson in the south, the Ukrainian military said, as western allies sought to buttress Ukraine and its neighbours against Moscow. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called for the EU to include Russia’s missile industry in its next sanctions package. Kuleba says it is warranted for their part in Russia’s war efforts, including those which have targeted Ukraine’s power infrastructure. Ukraine needs the US made Patriot missile defence systems to protect its civilian infrastructure, under heavy attack by Russia, foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, adding he would be working with the German government on this issue. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot systems, Reuters reported. The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against 22 Russians, including those the Foreign Office says were involved in enlisting criminals to fight in Ukraine. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said on Wednesday his department would target a new set of officials, including Denis Manturov, the deputy prime minister, who is responsible for troop equipment supplies. US president Joe Biden’s nominee to be ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, pledged on Wednesday to make the release of detained Americans a priority if she is confirmed to one of most important, and challenging, US diplomatic posts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/may/05/meltdown-three-mile-island-netflix-us-nuclear-accident","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-05T14:03:42Z","webTitle":"‘Dodged a bullet’: how whistleblowers averted a second US nuclear disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/05/meltdown-three-mile-island-netflix-us-nuclear-accident","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/05/meltdown-three-mile-island-netflix-us-nuclear-accident","fields":{"headline":"‘Dodged a bullet’: how whistleblowers averted a second US nuclear disaster","bodyText":"Shortly after 4am on 28 March 1979, a pressure valve failed to close in the Unit 2 reactor at Three Mile Island, a nuclear power plant on a strip of land in central Pennsylvania’s Susquehanna River. The technical malfunction, compounded by human error – control room workers misread confusing signals and halted the emergency water cooling system – heated the nuclear core to dangerously high levels. The film The China Syndrome was still in theaters, starring Jane Fonda as a television reporter investigating cover-ups at a nuclear power plant whose meltdown could release radioactive material deep into the earth, “all the way to China”. Three Mile Island – still the worst commercial nuclear accident in US history – was no China Syndrome, but it got terrifyingly close to catastrophic, Chernobyl-level damage. As the Netflix docuseries Meltdown: Three Mile Island recounts, Unit 2 came less than half an hour from fully melting down – a disaster scenario that would have sickened hundreds of thousands in the surrounding area. Two days after the accident, an explosive bubble of hydrogen gas was found in the reactor. The plant’s operator, Metropolitan Edison, tried to downplay the risk of radioactive releases, but panic ensued; more than 100,000 people fled the surrounding area. Plant technicians were eventually able to slowly bleed the gas from the cooling reactor, avoiding a deadly explosion. Though workers inside the plant were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation, it remains unknown how much contamination escaped the facility into the surrounding community. That is the story of Three Mile Island that most Americans will find in the history textbooks, if they have heard of the accident at all. The first two of Meltdown’s four 45-minute episodes focus on this chilling near-miss, as well as the obfuscation and confusion that greatly eroded public trust in nuclear power. But the story of Three Mile Island did not end with the five-day red-alert saga – not for the workers tasked with safely cleaning up the molten reactor, nor for the surrounding community, disillusioned and furious. In its second half, Meltdown, directed by Kief Davidson, homes in on the story of Rick Parks, a cleanup supervisor turned whistleblower on the Bechtel Corp, the company hired to conduct the billion-dollar cleanup by Metropolitan Edison and supervised by the government’s Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). “While a lot of people know about the disaster, they don’t know about what happened in the cleanup phase and how close we were to another disaster,” Davidson told the Guardian. “We dodged a bullet a second time, and it was entirely due to the fact that Rick Parks and [fellow whistleblower] Larry King stood up. “We should know about these stories,” he added. “We should be able to look at the people who risk everything in order to save communities from a potential disaster.” Parks, a Missouri native and navy-trained nuclear operator who provides colorful, refreshingly straight-shooting narration throughout the series, moved to Middletown, Pennsylvania – the town directly adjacent to Three Mile Island – to work on cleanup three years after the accident. At the time, Bechtel was the largest private construction company in the world, with numerous Reagan administration officials on its board. The cleanup was risky, arduous and behind schedule. Bechtel received funds upon completion of individual tasks, incentivizing the company and its hirer, General Public Utilities (GPU), to cut corners and ignore NRC regulations. Parks was particularly alarmed by rushed, off-books repairs to a polar crane damaged by radioactivity. The crane was supposed to lift the head off the reactor to expose the core; according to Park and the series, if the faulty crane malfunctioned and dropped its load on to the core, the resulting damage could have caused a radioactive leak on par with the China Syndrome. When Parks and two other employees, King and Ed Gischel, took their concerns to higher-ups at GPU and the NRC, they were dismissed. Gischel was recommended for a psychological evaluation. Parks found marijuana placed in his car on the day of a random drug inspection; someone later broke into his apartment and searched his files. (The NRC’s on-site coordinator, Lake Bennett, participates in the series and claims to not remember meeting Parks. He later say whatever Parks told him did not merit concern – “I was satisfied that that crane was safe enough.”) Gravely concerned for the safety of family, Middletown and a potentially statewide disaster zone, Parks took his records to the Government Accountability Project, then went public days before a vote would certify the crane’s use. His disclosures and mounting public pressure caused the NRC to halt and then overhaul the cleanup process at Three Mile Island. Carla Shamberg, Meltdown’s executive producer, first heard of Parks through lawyers for the Government Accountability Project, some of whom appear in the series, while executive-producing another project: the 2000 film Erin Brockovich, starring Julia Roberts as a real-life whistleblower. It’s taken nearly 20 years since for some version of it to make it to air. Parks and other whistleblowers were “superheroes”, she told the Guardian. “They’re one of the last bastions of the truth.” “I think they should have capes,” she said. “They’re just amazing. They protect people they’ve never met and they protect thousands, if not millions, of people. It’s the bravest thing I’ve ever seen anybody do.” Parks’s story has a relatively happy ending – the series delves into the personal and emotional costs of his disclosures, but the damaged crane was not used. In 1983, the same year he came forward, Metropolitan Edison was indicted on criminal charges of falsifying safety reports before the accident; the company’s plea bargain included a $45,000 fine and $1m pledge to help emergency planning in the surrounding area. Still, in the four decades since, “it hasn’t gotten better for whistleblowers,” said Davidson. “To go public now is a lot different than it was even 10 years ago. It’s a lot harder now. Whistleblowers aren’t always rewarded for their actions.” To this day, the official government record is that radiation released at Three Mile Island never reached levels dangerous to humans; the official death toll is zero. But local residents turned activists, several of whom appear in the series, say otherwise. The film cites a 1997 study by epidemiologist Steven Wing, which found cancer rates two to three times the average in areas downwind of the facility. In 2017, researchers at Penn State College of Medicine found that a certain type of thyroid cancer was common in people who had been near the plant after the accident. Several subjects in the series – including Parks and his ex-stepdaughter Nicole, who was six years old at the time of the disaster – have survived bouts of cancer or lost loved ones to it. No one can be sure it’s related to radiation – Parks, who had throat cancer, was also a smoker, “so there’s always that but, and that’s why the NRC gets away with everything,” he says. But the anecdotes point to more than a coincidence. Still, “the project isn’t about how is the cancer, who got cancer, how many people got it,” said Davidson. Instead, the series argues for “holding industry and large corporations accountable for their actions. “We’re not coming into this story from a pro-nuclear standpoint,” said Davidson. “There’s pros and cons and arguments to both sides, and a lot of the characters that we’ve interviewed for this, like Rick Parks, really believe that to solve our energy crisis nuclear has to be in the mix. “But there’s consequences that have to be looked at. And when things go wrong, it can go wrong in a pretty horrible way,” he added. Or, as Parks says in the final episode: “We’ll never have a viable nuclear industry in this country until we take the profit motive out of it.” • This article was amended on 6 May 2022 to correct the spelling of Ed Gischel’s surname."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/25/first-thing-tributes-paid-to-queen-of-rock-and-soul-tina-turner","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T08:26:26Z","webTitle":"Tributes paid to ‘queen of rock and soul’ Tina Turner | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/25/first-thing-tributes-paid-to-queen-of-rock-and-soul-tina-turner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/25/first-thing-tributes-paid-to-queen-of-rock-and-soul-tina-turner","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: Tributes paid to ‘queen of rock and soul’ Tina Turner","bodyText":"Good morning. Tina Turner, the pioneering rock’n’roll star who became a pop behemoth in the 1980s, has died aged 83 after a long illness. An outpouring of tributes emerged online following the announcement. In a statement on Wednesday night, her publicist, Bernard Doherty, said: “Tina Turner, the ‘Queen of Rock’n’Roll’ has died peacefully today at the age of 83 after a long illness in her home in Küsnacht near Zurich, Switzerland. With her, the world loses a music legend and a role model.” Turner affirmed and amplified Black women’s formative stake in rock’n’roll, defining that era of music to the extent that Mick Jagger admitted to taking inspiration from her high-kicking, energetic live performances for his stage persona. On Instagram, Jagger shared his grief over Turner’s death. “I’m so saddened by the passing of my wonderful friend Tina Turner,” he wrote. “She was truly an enormously talented performer and singer. She was inspiring, warm, funny and generous. She helped me so much when I was young and I will never forget her.” The singer Diana Ross shared a picture of herself with Turner on Twitter, writing: “Shocked. Saddened. Sending condolences to Tina Turner’s family and loved ones.” When did her career start? In the 1960s with her abusive husband Ike Turner. After two decades of working with him, she struck out alone and – after a few false starts – became one of the defining pop icons of the 1980s with the album Private Dancer. Her life was chronicled in three memoirs, a biopic, a jukebox musical, and in 2021, the acclaimed documentary film, Tina. Read her obituary here. What was the cause of death? It’s unclear but she had suffered ill health in recent years, being diagnosed with intestinal cancer in 2016 and having a kidney transplant in 2017. Florida governor Ron DeSantis announces 2024 presidential bid The governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, has officially declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president, rolling out the news with a campaign video and a glitch-riddled event on Twitter with the owner of the social media site, Elon Musk. DeSantis filed paperwork yesterday with the Federal Election Commission, before his planned event with Musk and an interview with Fox News later yesterday evening. As governor of Florida, DeSantis has pursued divisive, culture war-focused policies, including signing a six-week abortion ban and targeting the teaching of LGBTQ+ and race issues in public schools. In his campaign video, DeSantis said he was running to “lead our great American comeback” and pitched Florida as a model for the nation. “We proved it can be done,” DeSantis said in a voiceover. “We chose facts over fear, education over indoctrination, law and order over rioting and disorder.” How did the Twitter launch go? Not well. The event marked the first time a major candidate had announced their run for president on social media and nearly 600,000 listeners tuned in to Spaces, Twitter’s dedicated audio streaming feature, but the results were a disaster. As the live stream began, the audio line experienced feedback, outages and garbled audio. Many users reported their Twitter apps crashing or logging them out as they tried to join the stream. What do we know about DeSantis? The Florida governor claims “blue-collar roots” and an Ivy League education but has pursued hard-right policies as he seeks to take on Donald Trump. Here are 10 things to know about Ron DeSantis. US lawmakers blame each other for debt ceiling standoff: ‘They are not negotiating’ Lawmakers exchanged sharp criticism about who was to blame for the protracted standoff over the debt ceiling yesterday. As the country nears its deadline to avoid a federal default, talks between Joe Biden and the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, continued on Wednesday, as negotiators met again to hash out the details of a potential deal. But both parties simultaneously traded pointed remarks, underscoring that an agreement is not yet in reach. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, pushed back against Republicans’ insistence on spending cuts. Jayapal said she spoke on Tuesday to White House officials who informed her that Republican negotiators had already rejected $3tn worth of deficit-reduction proposals, such as ending tax subsidies for large oil companies and closing the carried-interest loophole. “It is not actually about debt or deficit,” Jayapal said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon. “It is about keeping the cash flowing to the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations.” What are the stumbling blocks? McCarthy said that he would not support a “clean” bill raising the debt ceiling without cutting government spending and accused Biden of acquiescing to the “extreme” wing of his party. Rejecting the White House’s efforts to reduce the federal deficit by raising more tax revenue, McCarthy insisted that any agreement must focus on the spending side. “We have to spend less than we spent last year,” McCarthy said. “It’s not a revenue problem. It’s a spending problem.” What has the White House said? The White House voiced optimism that a deal could still be struck, saying the talks remained “productive”. “If it keeps going in good faith, then we can get to an agreement here that is bipartisan and that will get out of the House and get out of the Senate,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary.

Tucker Carlson’s home studio at his house in Maine has been dismantled by Fox News workers. On Wednesday, a source with knowledge of the situation told the Guardian: “We removed the equipment (which we own) after building a custom studio at our expense – we did not tear down the studio.” A state-sponsored Chinese hacking group has been spying on a wide range of US critical infrastructure organisations and similar activities could be occurring globally, western intelligence agencies and Microsoft have said.

Stat of the day: One in five deaths among young Californians tied to fentanyl Overdoses involving fentanyl were behind one in five deaths of people aged 15 to 24 in California, the latest indicator of an emergency that shows no signs of slowing. Drug overdoses now kill two to three times as many people in the state as car accidents, according to data compiled by the consulting group California Health Policy Strategies. Since 2017, deaths related to the synthetic opioid, which is 50 times stronger than heroin, have increased 1,027%. The crisis, which has visibly unfolded on city streets from San Francisco to Los Angeles, has sent officials scrambling for solutions. This year California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, proposed spending an additional $172m for a project distributing Naloxone, an overdose medication. But experts warn that more is needed and that the effects of the crisis will probably continue for years to come. Don’t miss this: ‘This is an epidemic’– inside the Thai clinic taking on westerners’ gaming addictions Muay Thai and meditation, mindfulness and massage: the schedule at the Cabin addiction treatment centre could easily be mistaken for that of a wellness retreat or luxury hotel. The Cabin previously catered to people with substance and alcohol addictions. But in 2016 it launched a specialised programme for gaming addicts. In 2022, the World Health Organization added “internet gaming disorder” to its International Classification of Diseases, defining the addiction, which affects between 2% and 3% of users, as a pattern of gaming behaviour that “takes precedence over other interests and daily activities”. In some cases, gamers can forget to eat or sleep, losing jobs and relationships in the process. In one incident in South Korea, a newborn starved to death while her parents gamed, and last year a 12-year-old Australian boy killed himself amid a gaming addiction. Climate check: Invasion of Ukraine ‘has fuelled funding boom for clean energy’ Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment which will significantly outpace spending on fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. A report from the IEA has found that clean energy investment is on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year as investors turn to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. At the same time investment in coal, gas and oil will rise to just over $1tn, the IEA said. The Paris-based agency found that clean energy investments have been boosted by many factors including periods of strong economic growth and volatile fossil fuel prices, as well as heightened concerns about energy security after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Last Thing: What lies beneath – Florida man finds iguana lurking in his toilet bowl Hearing “splashing” coming from his toilet, a 58-year-old Florida man looked into the bowl and found an iguana. “I look down, and I see this frightened-looking reptile looking back at me,” John Riddle, of Hollywood, told the Orlando Sentinel. An attempt to use a pool net to remove the lurking lavatorial lizard came to no good, so Riddle “worked up enough nerve to try to grab him” with his bare hands. The iguana swam “all the way into the toilet, into the pipe. I couldn’t see any of him,” Riddle said. “I’m used to [iguanas],” Riddle said, “but I’m just not used to them in my toilet bowl.” Iguanas in toilets may sound like an urban myth on a par with alligators in the sewers of New York City but in Florida they have become a very real problem.

Projects such as the HS2 high-speed railway and Hinkley Point C nuclear power station would be expected to buy more British steel under the policy, which is backed by the under-pressure industry. Labour also wants the government to set a target for UK steel content in big public works and give UK steel preferred status in contracts. The government this month set up a steel procurement taskforce led by the former Barclays chair Lord Grimstone to look at ways of boosting the industry, which is seen as a key supplier to defence as well as infrastructure. The government has identified a need for nearly 5m tonnes of steel over the next decade for infrastructure. However, it has so far stopped short of directly mandating that public projects use UK-based suppliers such as Liberty, or rivals including Indian-owned Tata Steel or British Steel, which was rescued a year ago by China’s Jingye. Stronger “buy British” guarantees in procurement notices would increase the direct benefit to the UK of infrastructure spending, said Lucy Powell, the shadow minister for business and consumers. “Having domestic steelmaking capacity is a cornerstone of our national security, economic prosperity and our fight to tackle the climate emergency, yet ministers are failing to back UK steelmaking with weak procurement practices that undermine these efforts,” she said. Labour’s intervention comes with questions hanging over the future of Liberty Steel, the UK’s third-largest steelmaker. Liberty’s owner, the industrialist Sanjeev Gupta, is trying to secure new loans after the collapse of its major backer, Greensill Capital. Gupta’s GFG Alliance is trying to negotiate a standstill agreement with Greensill’s administrators. A pledge to buy more British steel could potentially help Liberty Steel. For instance, steel bars produced in Rotherham would be candidates for building railways such as HS2 as well as offshore wind turbines. Many of the workers in Rotherham have been furloughed owing to lower demand in particular from the aerospace industry during the pandemic. It is understood that about a third of Liberty’s 5,000 workers have been furloughed as the company seeks to keep cash in the business until it can find new funding. Labour said its analysis of government data showed that £25m, almost a quarter of spending on steel for infrastructure, went abroad in 2018-19, the last year for which figures are available. UK Steel, a lobby group for the industry, backed the call for work to remain in the UK where possible. It calculates that 1,000 tonnes of steel produced in the UK helps to support about 4.5 jobs directly. Overall there are about 33,000 British steelworkers, plus another 74,000 workers in closely linked jobs, the lobby group said. “Government should always seek to promote British foundation industries, such as steel, through sensible, targeted and job-boosting public procurement,” said Gareth Stace, UK Steel’s director general. “When government-funded projects buy foreign steel, this money is then lost to the UK economy forever. We welcome proposals that keeps UK taxpayers’ money in steel communities and the UK economy.” David Bailey, a professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said increased procurement from the UK would help the industry, but added that government action was also needed on business rates and energy costs that are 62% higher than German rivals, according to industry calculations from 2019. “The UK government used to hide behind state aid rules,” Bailey said, referring to EU law. “It has no excuse not to act now.” A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Steel will play a critical role in providing the infrastructure necessary to drive a green economic recovery and project jobs,” highlighting wind farms, nuclear power stations and electric cars. “The government is currently reviewing its public procurement rules to ensure the system is better able to meet the needs of this country, whilst complying with our international obligations,” the spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jun/23/california-last-nuclear-power-plant-save","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-23T10:00:45Z","webTitle":"The last nuclear plant in California – and the unexpected quest to save it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/23/california-last-nuclear-power-plant-save","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jun/23/california-last-nuclear-power-plant-save","fields":{"headline":"The last nuclear plant in California – and the unexpected quest to save it","bodyText":"California’s last nuclear plant was nearing the end of its life. Tucked against picturesque bluffs along California’s central coast, the aging facility known as Diablo Canyon began operating in 1985. It was designed for a different era, with analog knobs and systems that no longer comply with the state’s environmental standards. The plant has faced controversies over its impact on underwater ecosystems, the production of toxic waste and its proximity to earthquake fault lines – and its planned closure by 2025 seemed an all-but-certain step in California’s ambitious journey toward a greener future. But with just three years to go, the fate of Diablo Canyon now looks less assured. California is facing steep energy challenges that are only expected to worsen as the climate crisis intensifies. The plant still provides roughly 9% of the state’s energy – the largest single source of electricity and enough to supply more than 3 million residents. The state is still far from finding a reliable and climate-friendly replacement, and concerns are rising that it will fall back on fossil fuels to fill the gap. Now, decades-old discussions about whether the plant should continue to play a role in California’s renewable energy transition are being rehashed. A diverse league of advocates – including energy officials, scientists, California’s governor Gavin Newsom, and even the musician Grimes – are pushing for renewed life for Diablo Canyon. Critics, meanwhile, say keeping the plant open would only be a step backward. Diablo Canyon has come to signify broader questions about the state’s energy future, and whether it’s ready to leave nuclear power behind. It’s an issue also lingering in the thoughts of officials across the US. Half of the country’s clean energy comes from nuclear power plants – but in many areas, it is being phased out. “It’s a sort of a bellwether – a test – of the political future for nuclear power in California and in the shifting environmental coalitions,” said Alex Trembath, the deputy director of the Breakthrough Institute, an energy and environment thinktank that advocates in favor of nuclear energy. “I think the story of Diablo Canyon is more important than just another plant.” Protests and money problems The many plants that once dotted California have closed one by one, and a law passed in 1976 banned new construction of nuclear stations until waste could be permanently disposed of. That’s left Diablo Canyon as the sole provider of nuclear energy. Even before it began operating, Diablo Canyon was a source of scrutiny. For years it was the site of demonstrations as anti-nuclear sentiments grew in the wake of disasters like Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and later on, Fukushima. There were concerns raised about environmental degradation and questions about storage of the nuclear waste produced by the facility. But it was not the protests that led to Diablo Canyon’s closure timeline. Instead, it was a matter of money. California regulators had cracked down on the system used at Diablo Canyon in 2010, a process known as “once-through cooling” for its impact on marine life. Roughly 2.5bn gallons of seawater slosh through the plant’s enormous intake tubes each day, cooling hot steam heated by nuclear reactors. The warmed water flushed back into the sea has had profound effects on ocean ecosystems and animals, including fish, sea lions, turtles, and other creatures are killed by the millions each year by the systems themselves, according to the California water board. Facing requirements for expensive upgrades and retrofits, estimated at roughly $4.5bn, and an increasingly competitive energy market centered around renewables, the plant’s owner and operator PG&amp;E agreed to a settlement in 2016 with environmental groups and labor organizations not to seek renewal on the licenses for its two reactors, which expire in 2024 and 2025 respectively. Endorsed by state regulators in 2018, the plan also gave California nearly a decade to ramp up the decarbonization of its grid and replace the lost energy with more affordable renewable sources. Unlike other plants that shut down abruptly due to mechanical errors or financing issues, the end of Diablo Canyon was heralded as an opportunity to phase out nuclear the right way. Energy challenges amid the climate crisis But in the years since, the energy landscape has shifted. California, which has pledged to run on 100% renewable electricity by 2045, is not on track to meet its goals. In order to get there, it needs to triple its current capacity and expand renewable sources at a “record-breaking rate”, according to the state’s energy commission. The climate crisis has also put the grid under immense strain. A historic drought has left the American west with waning water levels, threatening hydropower production, and spiking temperatures have caused surges in energy use, resulting in seasonal threats of rolling blackouts. Wildfires have also threatened disruptions, taking out transmission and distribution lines. Energy officials warned it will be especially difficult to navigate seasons when climate disasters hit all at once, potentially leaving millions of Californians without power during peak times of need in the coming years. The grid has grown more efficient and reliable due to renewables coming online and upgrades in systems, but the state’s energy agencies projected a significant shortfall that matches the energy lost when Diablo Canyon ceases to contribute. Meanwhile, energy costs will continue to rise. “This is a challenge,” said Lucas Davis, an expert on energy economics and professor at the University of California Berkeley. “When a major generation source closes there is less supply so that pushes up wholesale prices,” he said. The timing is bad. With cities mandating the phase-out of natural gas and more consumers switching to electric cars, demand for electricity is also expected to increase, driving up the price further. “We will need more generation,” Davis said. There are growing concerns that the state will be forced to fall back on polluting forms of energy, including natural gas, once the Diablo Canyon goes dark. As things stand currently, California would have to increase renewable energy by 20% over the next two years, as hydroelectric power wanes, the chances of which experts said were “increasingly dim”. If decarbonization is not escalated quickly, California stands to emit an additional 15.5m metric tons of greenhouse gasses with the closure of Diablo Canyon, according to an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists published last year. Trembath, of the Breakthrough Institute, says the fact that Diablo’s closure could create more emissions rather than reduce them provides a powerful test of California’s commitment to clean energy. Keeping the plant would not hinder new sources of renewable energy, he says, rather those new sources could go toward providing more energy for the grid, rather than just plugging the gap left by Diablo. “If the plant closes it won’t mean that California can’t keep making progress,” he said. “It will just be an indication that no matter how dire or ambitious our rhetoric is about our climate goals – if we close the plant that’s a signal that it’s just rhetoric.” But Ralph Cavanagh, the energy co-director of the environmental advocacy organization Natural Resources Defense Council’s Climate and clean energy program, who was involved in negotiating the joint settlement in 2016, sees little use in rehashing old debates and instead would like to see the momentum directed into finding new sources. Either way, he said, the plant is going to close. “This ship has sailed,” Cavanagh said. A new future for nuclear? Advocates of a nuclear future, however, have envisioned new opportunities for the plant. They argue that, despite its risks, nuclear’s promise of cleaner energy is essential for helping to stave off the worse effects of climate change while bolstering the grid. Nuclear energy is a zero-emissions energy source, which doesn’t emit carbon the way other energy sources do. It produces minimal waste and –though there are always risks of disaster – officials have certified that the plants and the byproducts they produce are safe. “The challenges here in California and globally are bigger than ever and the window of opportunity to mitigate climate change is closing fast,” Steven Chu and Ernest Moniz, two former US secretaries of energy wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed in support of Diablo Canyon. They cited a 2021 study from researchers at Stanford and Massachusetts Institute of Technology that examined new opportunities for the plant, including adding desalination and hydrogen production, another type of energy that is often made from natural gas. The study, published last year, helped reignite the debate around Diablo Canyon and how to bring it up-to-date. Researchers analyzed the viability of adding new features to the aging facility and concluded that by providing grid electricity, desalinated water and hydrogen, the overall value produced by the plant would increase, which would help offset the high investment costs required. That also spurred a change in tune from the governor. Newsom helped shape discussions about closing Diablo back in 2016 as Lt Governor and chair of the tate lands commission. But this year, now facing significant energy challenges as head of the state, Newsom became outspoken in favor of prolonging its life. While he said he wants to see it shutter eventually, he told the Los Angeles Times that its current trajectory may be too soon. Still, the financial piece of the puzzle remains. Diablo Canyon will have to be upgraded if it continues to exist, and it’s unclear whether PG&amp;E will be willing to invest further in the beleaguered plant. One option could be federal funding – the Biden administration has set aside $6bn to keep existing nuclear plants open, though whether Diablo would pursue that option remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the researchers at Stanford and MIT have raised other less-costly options that could mitigate impacts on marine life, but their conclusions have been questioned by critics of the plant, including Cavanagh. He remains adamant that the issue is a non-starter, likening the new momentum to “wishful thinking”. Noting that he believes in the importance of nuclear power’s contribution to the clean energy transition and reducing carbon emissions, Cavanagh emphasized that there are still three years to go before it is scheduled to fully power down. In that time, he said, the state should prioritize and invest in transitioning to renewables and seek solutions to power problems. “The danger of Diablo Canyon,” he said, “is that it is a tempting way of somehow assuming that there’s an easy way to avoid responsibility for the next phases of the clean energy transition.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-at-least-17-killed-in-attack-on-housing-in-zaporizhzhia","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-09T20:11:17Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Putin calls Crimea bridge attack an ‘act of terrorism’ — as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-at-least-17-killed-in-attack-on-housing-in-zaporizhzhia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-at-least-17-killed-in-attack-on-housing-in-zaporizhzhia","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Putin calls Crimea bridge attack an ‘act of terrorism’ — as it happened","bodyText":"We’re closing this liveblog now. You can read all our Ukraine coverage here. Thanks. It’s nearly 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: The Russian invasion of Ukraine, now in its eighth month, is being accompanied by the destruction and pillaging of historical sites and treasures on an industrial scale, Ukrainian authorities say. In an interview with The Associated Press, Ukraine’s culture minister alleged that Russian soldiers helped themselves to artifacts in almost 40 Ukrainian museums. Austria’s ministry of foreign affairs has condemned Russia’s recent attacks in Zaporizhzhia that has killed at least 13 people. The ministry called the attacks “utterly unacceptable and must stop,” adding that “those responsible must be held to account.” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US president Joe Biden spoke by phone on Sunday and agreed the Kremlin’s latest nuclear threats were “irresponsible” and its partial mobilization “a serious mistake”, according to a German government statement, Reuters reports. The nearly one-hour telephone call was focused on preparations for the upcoming G7 and G20 meetings that will address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the consequences, the statement said. Russia’s FSB security service said on Sunday it had seen a “considerable increase” in Ukrainian fire into its territory in recent days, claiming one person had been killed and five wounded over the past week. Since the start of October, the number of attacks from Ukrainian armed formations on Russia’s border territory has considerably increased,” said the FSB, which is responsible for border security. A Russian drone killed a civilian in Sumy oblast on Sunday, Euromaidan has reported. According to the deputy head of the office of the president of Ukraine, the victim was standing next to a store in the Myronivska community. The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that a power line that was cut yesterday by shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been restored. Ukraine’s national police said on Sunday that authorities had exhumed the first 20 bodies from makeshift graves in the recently liberated city of Lyman, in the eastern Donetsk region. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, now in its eighth month, is being accompanied by the destruction and pillaging of historical sites and treasures on an industrial scale, Ukrainian authorities say. Associated Press reports: In an interview with The Associated Press, Ukraine’s culture minister alleged that Russian soldiers helped themselves to artifacts in almost 40 Ukrainian museums. The looting and destruction of cultural sites has caused losses estimated in the hundreds of millions of euros (dollars), the minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, added. “The attitude of Russians toward Ukrainian culture heritage is a war crime,” he said. For the moment, Ukraine’s government and its Western backers supplying weapons are mostly focused on defeating Russia on the battlefield. But if and when peace returns, the preservation of Ukrainian collections of art, history and culture also will be vital, so survivors of the war can begin the next fight: rebuilding their lives. “These are museums, historical buildings, churches. Everything that was built and created by generations of Ukrainians,” Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, said in September when she visited a Ukrainian museum in New York. “This is a war against our identity.” Austria’s ministry of foreign affairs has condemned Russia’s recent attacks in Zaporizhzhia that has killed at least 13 people. The ministry called the attacks “utterly unacceptable and must stop,” adding that “those responsible must be held to account.” The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the US president, Joe Biden, spoke by phone on Sunday and agreed the Kremlin’s latest nuclear threats were “irresponsible” and its part mobilisation “a serious mistake”, according to a German government statement, Reuters reports. The nearly one-hour telephone call was focused on preparations for the upcoming G7 and G20 meetings, which will address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the consequences, the statement said. The two leaders agreed never to accept Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory, calling it a further escalation, the statement said. They agreed that Russia’s part mobilisation showed the “bitter price” Russians were having to pay for the miscalculations of Vladimir Putin. “They criticised the latest nuclear threats of Moscow as irresponsible and agreed such a step would have exceptionally serious consequences for Russia,” the statement said. On the topic of the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, the two leaders agreed the sabotage of critical infrastructure would be dealt with decisively, it said. A White House statement reaffirmed the talks between Scholz and Biden, saying: The leaders reiterated their condemnation of Russia’s attempted annexation of Ukrainian territory, as well as their ongoing commitment to hold Russia accountable for its brutal actions and provide security and economic assistance to Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said the explosion on a key bridge linking Crimea and the Russian mainland was a terrorist act planned by the Ukrainian special services. In a video address on the Kremlin’s Telegram channel on Sunday, Putin said: “There is no doubt. This is an act of terrorism aimed at destroying critically important civilian infrastructure … This was devised, carried out and ordered by the Ukrainian special services.” Putin was meeting Alexander Bastrykin, the head of Russia’s investigative committee, who was presenting findings of an inquiry into Saturday’s explosion and fire on the Kerch bridge. Russia’s FSB security service said on Sunday it had seen a “considerable increase” in Ukrainian fire into its territory in recent days, claiming one person had been killed and five wounded over the past week. Agence France-Presse reports: Since the start of October, the number of attacks from Ukrainian armed formations on Russia’s border territory has considerably increased,” said the FSB, which is responsible for border security. The attacks have concentrated on the Russian region of Belgorod, near the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, as well as Bryansk and Kursk, the FSB said. It said that in the past week “more than 100 bombardments were recorded in 32 localities, with the use of multiple rocket launchers, artillery, mortars and drones”. A child was among those wounded, the FSB said, adding that the attacks also “destroyed two electricity stations, 11 residential buildings and two administrative buildings”. A Russian drone killed a civilian in Sumy oblast on Sunday, Euromaidan has reported. According to the deputy head of the office of the president of Ukraine, the victim was standing next to a store in the Myronivska community.

Here is what you might have missed: The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will hold a meeting of his security council on Monday, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said. It comes after an explosion on Saturday caused the collapse of part of a bridge linking the Crimean peninsula with Russia. Ukrainian authorities have revised the death toll from the Russian shelling of the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia down from 17 to at least 12. The blasts blew out windows in adjacent buildings and left at least one high-rise apartment building partly collapsed. In the immediate aftermath of the strikes, the city council said 17 were killed but later revised that down to 12. The city council secretary, Anatoliy Kurtev, said rockets struck the city overnight, and that at least 20 private homes and 50 apartment buildings had been damaged. At least 40 people were admitted to hospital and dozens more were being treated for moderate to light injuries, Kurtev posted on his Telegram channel. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has vowed that those who ordered and carried out the “merciless” strikes on Zaporizhzhia will be held responsible. In a post on his Facebook page, he said the attack was “evil” and that everyone involved in the incident “will be held accountable”. The blasts that killed at least 12 people in Zaporizhzhia came from six missiles launched in Russian-occupied areas of the wider region, the Ukrainian air force has said. The Zaporizhzhia region is one of four that Russia claimed as its own this month, but the regional capital remains under Ukrainian control. Reuters reports that the White House said it would continue to arm Ukraine but declined to make a direct comment on an explosion that damaged Russia’s road-and-rail bridge to Crimea. The Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told ABC’s This Week programme: “We don’t really have anything more to add to the reports about the explosion on the bridge. What I can tell you is that Mr Putin started this war, and Mr Putin could end it today, simply by moving his troops out of the country.” The Russian invasion of Ukraine is being accompanied by the destruction and pillaging of historical sites and treasures on an industrial scale, Ukrainian authorities have said.

Ukraine has recaptured more than 1,170 sq km (450 sq miles) of land in its southern Kherson region since launching the start of its counter-assault against Russia in late August, a military spokesperson said. Ukraine achieved success with its offensive in the north-east, but its drive in the south to wipe out a Russian foothold on the west bank of the vast Dnipro river has taken longer, Reuters reports. Southern military command spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk said Ukraine was making progress on the Kherson front, but that a lot needed to be done to secure newly recaptured territories. The damage from Saturday’s explosion on the Kerch bridge in Crimea could have a “significant” impact on Russia’s “already strained ability to sustain its forces” in southern Ukraine, the latest UK intelligence update said. The Ministry of Defence said the blast “will likely touch President Putin closely” for reasons including that it came hours after his 70th birthday; that he personally sponsored and opened the bridge; and that its construction contractor was a childhood friend. The ministry said the bridge’s rail crossing had played a key role in moving heavy military vehicles to the southern front during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian divers were due on Sunday to examine the extent of damage from the blast on the Kerch bridge linking Crimea to Russia. Russian news agencies quoted the deputy prime minister, Marat Khusnullin, as saying the divers would start work on Sunday at 6am (3am GMT), with a more detailed survey above the waterline expected to be completed by the end of the day.

She said on Ukrainian television: Work is continuing on consolidation of territory, clearing it and conducting stabilising operations, as the settlements we enter contain many surprises left by the (Russian) occupiers As of today, from the beginning of the counter-offensive, over 1,170 sq km have been liberated in the Kherson direction. Ukrainian officials have long talked up the priority of recapturing Kherson, a flat, agricultural region which Moscow captured in its near-entirety in the early days of its invasion. Reuters reports that the White House said it would continue to arm Ukraine but declined direct comment on an explosion that damaged Russia’s road-and-rail bridge to Crimea. National security spokesman John Kirby told ABC’s This Week programme: We don’t really have anything more to add to the reports about the explosion on the bridge. What I can tell you is that Mr Putin started this war, and Mr Putin could end it today, simply by moving his troops out of the country. Kirby said both sides needed to find a way to negotiate an end to the war but that Putin had shown no interest in doing so. He added: Quite the contrary. By calling up hundreds of thousands of reservists, by politically annexing, or at least trying to annex four areas of Ukraine, he has shown every indication that he is doubling down. This, said Kirby, “is why, quite frankly, we are in touch almost daily with the Ukrainians and we’re going to continue to provide them security assistance.” These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. Nicole Stybnarova, a lecturer in public international law at the University of Oxford, has written for us to argue that Putin’s war is illegal – and Russians fleeing the draft may have the right to asylum: Russian software architect “AA” was one of 17,000 people who fled Russia for Finland last weekend. This was before Finland closed its border with Russia, which was the last direct route from Russia to the European Union. AA told Finnish journalists that Russia was establishing “call-up centres or contact points” on the other side of the border, preventing people from leaving and funnelling them into the armed forces. Apparently, no authority on either side of the borders between Russia and the EU is now interested in the fate of ordinary Russians who refuse to fight in the criminal invasion of Ukraine. Read more: Putin’s war is illegal – and Russians fleeing the draft may have the right to asylum Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs has provided an update on Russian losses in the war. According to the government department, 62,500 Russian soldiers have been killed and 5,133 armoured personnel vehicles destroyed or captured. Vladimir Putin’s forces have also lost 1,477 artillery systems, 266 aircraft, 235 helicopters and 2,486 tanks. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify these numbers. The blasts that killed at least 17 people in Zaporizhzhia came from six missiles launched in Russian-occupied areas of the wider region, the Ukrainian air force has said. The Zaporizhzhia region is one of four Russia claimed as its own this month, but the regional capital remains under Ukrainian control. Emma Graham-Harrison and Charlotte Higgins report for us in Lviv: In a time of violence, warfare and bloodshed, what is the use of literature? This was a question addressed at the Lviv BookForum, a three-day literary festival in the Ukrainian city, staged despite – and in defiance of – the Russian invasion. The festival has brought together Ukrainian, British and international authors including human rights lawyer Philippe Sands, whose bestselling book, East West Street, is largely set in 20th-century Lviv. Ukrainian writer Oleksandr Mykhed told audiences that at the moment of the invasion, he realised: “You could not protect your family from a rifle with your poems. You could not hit someone with a book, you could try but it won’t work with the crazy occupiers from Moscow. I lost belief in the power of culture, lost interest in reading.” Read more: ‘People need to tell stories’: Lviv holds literary festival in defiance of war Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s minister for foreign affairs, has urged western countries to provide air and missile defence systems following Russian shelling in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. Peter Beaumont reports for us from Kyiv: At least 17 people have been killed by Russian shelling of a residential area in Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, a region that the Kremlin illegally claims to have annexed despite not controlling all of it. The overnight attack happened in the aftermath of a devastating explosion on the key bridge linking Russian-occupied Crimea to the Russian mainland, a prestige project of the president, Vladimir Putin. The blast seriously damaged the 12-mile-long (19km) structure, which serves as an important military supply route. The Zaporizhzhia strike came as Ukrainians – jubilant over the damage to the Kerch bridge, a hated symbol of Putin’s ambitions – were bracing for a major retaliation by Moscow, which had warned Kyiv against targeting the structure.

He said: The attitude of Russians toward Ukrainian culture heritage is a war crime. Mariupol’s exiled city council said Russian forces pilfered more than 2,000 items from the city’s museums. Among the most precious items were ancient religious icons, a unique handwritten Torah scroll, a 200-year-old bible and more than 200 medals, the council said. Also looted were artworks by painters Arkhip Kuindzhi, who was born in Mariupol, and Crimea-born Ivan Aivazovsky, both famed for their seascapes, the exiled councillors said. The UN’s cultural agency is keeping a tally of sites being struck by missiles, bombs and shelling. With the war now in its eighth month, the agency says it has verified damage to 199 sites in 12 regions. They include 84 churches and other religious sites, 37 buildings of historic importance, 37 buildings for cultural activities, 18 monuments, 13 museums and 10 libraries, Unesco said. The time is just past 1pm in Kyiv. Here is what you might have missed: Shelling in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia has killed at least 17 people, city official Anatoliy Kurtev has said. Anton Gerashchenko, a senior presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said preliminary figures suggested 17 dead and 40 wounded after an attack on residential housing. “The Russians are not able to respond on the battlefield and therefore hit the cities in the rear,” he said. The city lies 125km (80 miles) from the Russian-held nuclear power plant that is Europe’s largest. Zelenskiy has vowed that those who ordered and issued the “merciless” strikes in Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia will be held responsible. In a post on his Facebook page, he said the attack was “evil” and that everyone involved in the incident “will be held accountable”. The damage from Saturday’s explosion on the Kerch bridge in Crimea could have a “significant” impact on Russia’s “already strained ability to sustain its forces” in southern Ukraine, the latest UK intelligence update says.

Vladimir Putin signed a decree late on Saturday tightening security for the Kerch bridge and for energy infrastructure between Crimea and Russia after the explosion that crippled the heavily guarded bridge. Russia’s federal security service, the FSB, is in charge of the effort. By Saturday evening, Russia said the rail link across the bridge was operational again but road traffic would remain constricted. An adviser to Zelenskiy said the explosion on the Kerch bridge was just “the beginning”. Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter: “Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything that is stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled.” Three people were killed on Saturday after a truck bomb caused a fire and the collapse of a section of the bridge, Russian officials said. Russian troops fighting in the Mykolaiv, Kryvyi Rih and Zaporizhzhia regions of southern Ukraine could receive all the supplies they needed via existing land and sea corridors, said Russia’s defence ministry after the Kerch bridge explosion. The road-and-rail bridge has been used to take Russian personnel and military supplies through the peninsula into other parts of Ukraine’s south. The parliamentary leader of Zelenskiy’s party has stopped short of claiming Kyiv was responsible for the Kerch bridge blast but appeared to cast it as a consequence of Moscow’s takeover of Crimea and attempts to integrate the peninsula with the Russian mainland. “Russian illegal construction is starting to fall apart and catch fire,” David Arakhamia wrote on Telegram. “The reason is simple: if you build something explosive, then sooner or later it will explode.” Russia has named a new senior commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. Sergei Surovikin is a notorious general who opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in the 1990s. He led the Russian military expedition in Syria in 2017, where he was accused of using “controversial” tactics including indiscriminate bombing against anti-government fighters. Zelenskiy said Ukrainian troops were involved in “very tough fighting” near Bakhmut, a strategically important eastern town Russia is trying to take. Reuters reported that while Ukrainian troops had recaptured thousands of square kilometres of land in recent offensives in the east and south, officials say progress is likely to slow once Kyiv’s forces meet more determined resistance. Zelenskiy said in his nightly address: “We are holding our positions in the Donbas, in particular in the Bakhmut direction, where it is very, very difficult now – very tough fighting.” Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom, said the diesel generators at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had only a limited supply of fuel. Overnight shelling cut power to the plant, which needs cooling to avoid a meltdown, forcing it to switch to emergency generators. The United Natoins atomic watchdog has renewed calls for a protection zone at the plant, condemning the shelling as “tremendously irresponsible”. Ukraine’s GDP has shrunk by 30% in nine months, the ministry of economy said on Saturday. “Among the negative factors that affected the economy, the weather and the actions of the occupiers stand out,” it said. France’s prestigious Bayeux War Correspondents’ Awards on Saturday largely honoured reporting on the Ukraine conflict, with Associated Press and Burkina Faso newspaper Sidwaya among the recipients. The photo prize went to Ukrainian photographer Evgeniy Maloletka for his work with video journalist Mstyslav Chernov on the fall of Mariupol for AP. The series of explosions that rocked Kharkiv early on Saturday sparked a fire at one of the city’s medical institutions, the mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city said. Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram that the explosions were the result of missile strikes in the city centre, Associated Press reported. They also sparked a fire in a non-residential building. The German defence minister has told Nato it must do more to bolster security, warning: “We cannot know how far Putin’s delusions of grandeur can go.” Christine Lambrecht said Germany had heard of Russian threats to Lithuania for implementing EU sanctions and that they must be taken seriously and be prepared, Reuters reported. The UK has rejected Moscow’s call for a secret ballot in the UN general assembly next week on whether to condemn Russia’s move to annex four regions in Ukraine and requested that the 193-member body vote publicly. The general assembly is set to vote on a draft resolution that would condemn Russia’s “illegal so-called referenda” and the “attempted illegal annexation”. The latest pictures from the Russian shelling of housing in Zaporizhzhia that has reportedly killed at least 17 people. Slovakia’s defence minister, Yaroslav Nad, has tweeted that two Zuzana howitzers have been sent to Ukraine. He said: To celebrate his 70th birthday, we gave the aggressor Putin another gift. Two more new Zuzana 2 howitzers are already in Ukraine (and much more to come). Andrew Roth reports for us from Moscow: Russia has appointed a notorious general who opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in the 1990s as its first overall commander for the war in Ukraine, as the Kremlin struggles to halt a Ukrainian counteroffensive that has left its forces in disarray. The appointment of Gen Sergei Surovikin came on the same day as Vladimir Putin was dealt a humiliating blow after an explosion on the Kerch bridge sank a section of the motorway into the Kerch Strait and caused a major fire on the railway. Surovikin is a veteran commander who led the Russian military expedition in Syria in 2017, where he was accused of using “controversial” tactics including indiscriminate bombing against anti-government fighters.

The tweet adds that if Ukrainian military forces “had modern anti-missile systems, we could have prevented such tragedies”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has vowed that those who ordered and issued the “merciless” strikes in Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia will be held responsible. In a post on his Facebook page, he said: Zaporozhye again. Again merciless strikes on civilians. In residential buildings, just in the middle of the night. There are already 12 dead. 49 injured in hospital, 6 of them children. The absolute meanness of all. Absolute evil. Inhumans and terrorists. From the one who gave this order, and to all who followed this order. They will be held accountable. A must. Before the law and before the people. Peter Beaumont in Kyiv and Pjotr Sauer report: As a chilly autumn dawn broke on Saturday over the Kerch bridge linking Russia-occupied Crimea to the mainland, the road traffic was light. With the sky turning pink, a few cars and several lorries were making their way across the bridge, which is about 12 miles (19km) long and before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was used by 15,000 cars a day, A little way distant and above the cars, a long cargo train carrying tankers of fuel among its wagons was also making its way towards the peninsula across the parallel railway bridge. The blast, when it came at 6.07am (3.07 GMT), was devastating. CCTV footage posted on Russian Telegram channels showed a car and a lorry moving almost together when a vast fireball engulfed them, orange mixed with a storm of white-hot fragments swirling around the span.

The Kerch bridge, a hated symbol of the Kremlin’s occupation of the southern Ukrainian peninsula, was built in 2018. Footage shared on Russian Telegram channels and news agencies appeared to show the moment of the explosion with two vehicles, a truck and a car, at the centre of the blast, although it was unclear whether either was responsible or simply caught up in the detonation At least 12 people were killed and 49 hospitalised, including six children, as a result of the shelling in the city of Zaporizhzhia, the region’s governor says. A nine-storey building was partially destroyed overnight, five other residential buildings levelled and many more damaged in 12 Russian missile attacks on the city in south-east Ukraine, Reuters quoted Oleksandr Starukh as saying. The governor said on Telegram: There may be more people under the rubble. A rescue operation is under way at the scene. Eight people have already been rescued. City official Anatoliy Kurtev had said earlier that at least 17 people were killed when missiles hit a high-rise apartment complex and buildings. Russian divers will on Sunday examine the extent of damage from the blast on the Kerch bridge linking Crimea to Russia. Russian news agencies quoted the deputy prime minister, Marat Khusnullin, as saying the divers would start work on Sunday at 6am (0300 GMT), with a more detailed survey above the waterline expected to be complete by the end of the day. The work came as the Kremlin-installed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said: Of course, emotions have been triggered and there is a healthy desire to seek revenge. Peter Beaumont in Kyiv has the full story: The damage from Saturday’s explosion on the Kerch bridge in Crimea could have a “significant” impact on Russia’s “already strained ability to sustain its forces” in southern Ukraine, the latest UK intelligence update says. The Ministry of Defence said the blast “will likely touch President Putin closely” for reasons including that it came hours after his 70th birthday, he personally sponsored and opened the bridge, and its construction contractor was a childhood friend. The ministry said the bridge’s rail crossing had played a key role in moving heavy military vehicles to the southern front during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The extent of damage to the rail crossing was uncertain, it said, but any serious disruption to its capacity would be “highly likely” to significantly affect Russian forces in Ukraine’s south. Some officials in Moscow and in Russian-occupied Ukraine have called for retaliation over the explosion that heavily damaged the Kerch bridge linking Crimea and Russia on Saturday. “There is an undisguised terrorist war against us,” Russian ruling party deputy Oleg Morozov told the RIA Novosti news agency. Agence France-Presse quoted a Russian-installed official in the occupied Ukrainian Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, as saying: Everyone is waiting for a retaliatory strike and it is likely to come. Military analysts said the blast could have a major impact if Moscow saw the need to shift already hard-pressed troops to the Crimea from other regions or if it prompted a rush by residents to leave. Mick Ryan, a retired Australian major general now with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that even if Ukrainians were not behind the blast, it constituted “a massive influence operation win for Ukraine”. He said on Twitter: It is a demonstration to Russians, and the rest of the world, that Russia’s military cannot protect any of the provinces it recently annexed. Shelling in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia has killed at least 17 people, city official Anatoliy Kurtev has said. Anton Gerashchenko, a senior presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said preliminary figures suggested 17 dead and 40 wounded after an attack on residential housing. “The Russians are not able to respond on the battlefield and therefore hit the cities in the rear,” he said. The city lies 125km (80 miles) from the Russian-held nuclear power plant that is Europe’s largest.

Next to a pockmarked bus stop was debris left behind by Vladimir Putin’s army: machine-gun bullets, cigarette packets and an empty tin of tuna. “It was a difficult time. People are worried the Russians might come back,” Davidenko said. He added: “I talked to the Russian soldiers as they drove past. They were young guys from Siberia. They asked me: ‘Batya [Dad], how are you living?’ I answered: ‘We are fine here, thanks very much.’” Russian forces trundled into the Chernobyl exclusion zone on 24 February in the early hours of the invasion. According to Davidenko, they crossed over the Pripyat River from Belarus using a pontoon bridge. They then headed towards the Chernobyl nuclear power station, covered with a giant sarcophagus, the scene of the disastrous 1986 accident. By breakfast time they had seized the station. Russian troops disarmed the 169 Ukrainian national guards based at the plant and rounded up its technical staff, 103 people. They established a command centre and began digging fortifications including tank shelters, trenches and an underground kitchen. For 1,000 servicemen, Chernobyl became home. The Kremlin seemed unaware of – or indifferent to – the risks posed by radiation to its service personnel. The bulk of Putin’s invading army kept going. It headed south through the pine forest and along a smooth asphalt road leading to Kyiv, 130km away. The route goes past bucolic mini-lakes and bogs, and past gulls and the odd swan. “On the second day, 1,700 vehicles went through my village,” Davidenko said. “We counted them. They moved in four lanes. There were combat and Mi-2 transport helicopters flying continuously above us in formation, shaking the windows. The Ka-52 attack helicopters flew extremely low, 100 metres from the ground, dipping up and down.” Davidenko, 68, works as a ranger in Chernobyl’s national park. It is situated inside the 30km exclusion zone, which covers 260,000 hectares of territory. The Russian infantry fighting vehicles arriving every few minutes threw up clouds of radioactive dust. Soldiers, meanwhile, worked and slept in Chernobyl’s prohibited deadly red zone, near the abandoned city of Pripyat. Historians may describe what happened around Chernobyl as a case of imperial hubris. Speaking on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Kremlin had expected it could seize Kyiv within 48 hours. It had not anticipated much resistance. “Russia’s leadership expected to see a parade on Khreschatyk [the capital’s main street] after a few days,” he said. Instead, Ukrainian fighters ambushed the column near the city of Ivankiv, down the road from the Chernobyl checkpoint. Davidenko said he and other locals passed on the coordinates of enemy vehicles. This allowed home artillery to target the advance with lethal accuracy. Ukrainian soldiers slipped through the forest on foot or quad bikes, a phantom outfit of partisans. Enraged, the Russians began hunting for Ukrainian “spies”. Davidenko said they interrogated civilians in his village, Prybirsk, and confiscated mobile phones. “They even searched our clothes in case we had concealed notes,” he recounted. “Five young people had taken pictures of their tanks. They took them away. We don’t know what happened to them.” Ivan, a Ukrainian soldier nicknamed “the Frenchman”, said Russian troops were taken aback when they came under fire. They expected bread and salt – a traditional Ukrainian greeting – and were instead met with “fire and sword”, he said. He added: “The Moscow plan was blitzkrieg. When we attacked, it quickly became hell for them. Some abandoned their vehicles and ran off.” He stressed: “We knew the locality. They didn’t know how to orientate themselves.” Ivan praised his commanding officer for staying cool under Russian shelling. He said he took part in the battle for Kyiv last month around the city of Irpin. “We were under tremendous pressure. We Cossacks don’t go on our knees for anyone, except for our mothers and the national flag. This isn’t merely a war for our independence. It’s for European values,” he said. Over at the nuclear power plant, the original staff worked for 25 days under Russian supervision. Forty-five volunteers then replaced them. All were unable to monitor radiation levels because the soldiers stole their computer servers. They also took tables, furniture, microwaves and Chernobyl staff uniforms, said Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone state agency. Kramarenko said the troops would have breathed in radionuclides, especially during physical activity and trench-digging. “We believe they will feel the consequences of the radiation they received. Some sooner, some later,” he said. “This is the first time the world has seen tanks at a nuclear power plant.” For more than a month the Russians also occupied the villages surrounding the zone. Five of them broke into the farmstead where Yulia Mikhailenko, 28, lived with her mother, Zoya, and her daughters, six-year-old Karmila and one-year-old Zlata, in Khocheva. The women hid in the forest for several days, cold and hungry, until one of the girls got sick with a temperature. Mikhailenko went home to get medicine. She found the conscripts living there. They had broken her front door. “The house was a mess. They took everything. Gold, my laptop, flashcards and all of our crockery, including the frying pan. I said: “You can see children live here. Why did you do this?’ They looked a bit guilty and stared at their boots. They also cut our electricity cable.” On her fridge the soldiers had scratched: “Glory to Russia”. They painted graffiti on an outside wall of a monkey smiley beneath the word “Ukraine”. The monkey had a cross for a mouth – implying, it appeared, that Mikhailenko’s country should now shut up. “We were very afraid,” she said. “Then on 31 March they suddenly left.” The Kremlin announced that it was pulling its forces out of the Kyiv region in preparation for a major offensive in the east. The Russians had advanced from Chernobyl as far as the village of Demydiv, between the Irpin river and a dam next to Kyiv’s reservoir. They were unable to go further. As they retreated back to the exclusion zone, the blew up several bridges. Back in the exclusion zone, soldiers drove a stream of stolen Ukrainian vehicles back to Belarus, as well as their own military hardware. They took the captured national guardsmen with them. They were summoned to the power plant’s conference room, where their hands were bound, and they were driven off. “We don’t know where they are,” Kramarenko said. Ukraine’s nuclear agency is now trying to clear up the damage. The plant is still without electricity. The departing Russians left tripwires and mines concealed among radioactive trees. Kramarenko said five of his staff were killed while fighting in territorial defence units. Others were in a “difficult” psychological state after being forced to cohabit with their occupiers. On Wednesday the signs of fighting were all around. A kilometre from the Dytiatky control point the carcass of a burnt-out Russian infantry vehicle lay on the forest road. “Glory to Ukraine” was painted on its side in white letters. Swirling tracks in the sand and cut fir branches marked where its crew had parked. There were Russian ration packages and empty bottles. Davidenko said he had survived the Russian takeover relatively unscathed. He managed to hide his car, snowplough and canoe in the forest. The exclusion zone’s animal denizens appeared to have ignored one of this century’s most extraordinary battles, he said. They included bears, elk, deer and white storks who feed from the fish-rich Pripyat River. “They are flourishing. Their numbers are going up,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/mar/09/keir-starmer-says-pms-failed-energy-policy-is-causing-bills-to-rocket","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-09T13:42:21Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer says PM’s ‘failed energy policy’ is causing bills to rocket","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/09/keir-starmer-says-pms-failed-energy-policy-is-causing-bills-to-rocket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/mar/09/keir-starmer-says-pms-failed-energy-policy-is-causing-bills-to-rocket","fields":{"headline":"Keir Starmer says PM’s ‘failed energy policy’ is causing bills to rocket","bodyText":"Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of presiding over a “failed energy policy” that is resulting in rocketing bills, as he called for the government to invest in nuclear and renewable energy sources and insulate homes to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas. The Labour leader used prime minister’s questions to repeatedly link the impact of the invasion of Ukraine to the cost of living crisis, an issue where many Conservative MPs want to see more robust action from ministers. Starmer called for more direct help to cut energy bills, including a windfall tax on oil companies, but also demanded urgent action to reduce reliance on hydrocarbons, including an end to a de facto ban on new onshore wind projects. Johnson argued against a windfall tax and said existing efforts to help with energy bills were generous. Starmer responded with derision, saying: “I don’t think the prime minister understands the mess he’s in.” The government, Starmer said, should be “starting a new era of energy policy, never again at the mercy of a dictator”, including more nuclear power, “sprinting” for more renewables, and rapid moves to insulate homes. “So why is the prime minister offering the same failed energy policy that cast us into the security crisis and allowed bills to rocket?” Starmer asked. Johnson argued the government had already introduced “unprecedented measures” to help with bills, including a one-off £200 loan to offset energy costs and £150 for some households towards council tax. Johnson dismissed the idea of a windfall tax, saying: “The net result of that would be to see the oil companies put their prices up yet higher, and make it more difficult for them to do what we need them to do … and that is divesting from dependence on Russian oil and gas. That is the way forward for this country – it is to take a sober, responsible approach.” But Starmer noted that average energy bills were due to rise by £700 in April, with the £200 loan not arriving till October, by which point bills were likely to rise another £1,000. “It’s a total mess,” Starmer said. “So I ask again: when is the prime minister going to force the chancellor to U-turn?” After Johnson ruled out the idea of a windfall tax on the high profits from oil companies assisted by rising prices, Starmer said the prime minister was “protecting energy profits, not working people”. The Labour leader said: “Britain can’t afford another crisis like this. We need to improve our long-term energy security. That starts with supporting new nuclear and renewables.” The government had, he said, “effectively banned new onshore wind”, asking: “Will the prime minister relax planning laws, end the block on onshore wind, and stop supporting policies that make us so dependent on foreign gas?” Saying that the UK had the least energy-efficient housing stock in Europe, Starmer called for an “urgent national mission” to insulate homes, saying this could save households £400 a year in bills. “All the government has is a failed policy,” Starmer said. “Taking all their announcements together, it will take 75 years to deliver the upgrades that we need. That’s a lifetime, when we need urgent action. When is the prime minister going to get on with it?” Johnson argued that the UK was “the Saudi Arabia of wind power”, and blamed the lack of new nuclear power on Labour governments, which were last in power in 2010."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/nov/27/russian-raids-western-apathy-kyiv-putin-ukrainians-us-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T09:00:03Z","webTitle":"Even amid murderous Russian raids, western apathy is Kyiv’s deadliest foe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/27/russian-raids-western-apathy-kyiv-putin-ukrainians-us-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/27/russian-raids-western-apathy-kyiv-putin-ukrainians-us-europe","fields":{"headline":"Even amid murderous Russian raids, western apathy is Kyiv’s deadliest foe","bodyText":"A two-day-old baby is killed in an attack on a maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Officials say at least 437 children have died since Russia’s invasion began. More than 800 have been injured. How many kids are permanently traumatised is anybody’s guess. Every day, Vladimir Putin gets away with murder. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is shelled again, despite repeated UN warnings of Europe-wide catastrophe. In liberated Kherson, more grisly evidence of war crimes is uncovered. Wherever the Russians go, it’s the same horror story. Every day the killers go unpunished. Relentless waves of indiscriminate missile strikes darken Ukrainian skies, pulverising apartment blocks, clinics, shopping centres and schools. Moscow no longer even pretends to target the military. Its aim: to terrorise civilians. Destroying electricity, heat and water supplies to the main cities, already suffering food and medicine shortages, is key to Putin’s winter war. He strives to break Ukraine’s will, imperilling millions besieged by snow and ice. Every day, he perpetrates crimes against humanity. Russia’s red-handed army of homicidal generals, incompetent field commanders, out-of-control soldiers and hapless conscripts is attempting genocide – annihilation of a nation and a people – in plain sight. The European parliament voted last week to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Good. Now order Putin’s arrest! Issue warrants for the president and all his gang. Expel his lying diplomats. Penalise his pals. Close the borders. Or is this feelgood Euro-posturing? The question is rhetorical. You know the answer. As blacked-out Moldova warned last week, another huge humanitarian and migrant crisis looms, akin to that of last spring. It will challenge every EU country. Yet as the strain of multiple Ukraine-related problems begins to tell, European support may be faltering at this critical juncture. The war and its atrocities are being normalised and, increasingly, discounted. Where is the outrage now? Where the visceral fury? Nine months in, western public opinion is dulled, deadened and desensitised by a daily diet of remote, unceasing, almost routine carnage. People are no longer shocked, nor even greatly surprised. They feel powerless. The majority still wants Ukraine to prevail. But victory is not expected soon. In the absence of peace talks or any relief, war fatigue teeters towards apathy. In Italy and Germany, far-right voices complain they are “fed up” with the war’s costly knock-on effects. Protests against the stand-off with Moscow pockmark central Europe. Conflicted fellow travellers give Putin leave to carry on killing. It’s only November. For everyone, the worst of winter is yet to come. And there are limits to how often Kyiv can repair damaged pylons, cables and power plants. As soon as they are fixed, missiles blow them apart. “Invincibility shelters” can only do so much. “Today is just one day, but we have received 70 missiles. That’s the Russian formula of terror,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last Wednesday. “Hospitals, schools, transport, residential districts all suffered.” As usual, the “firm reaction” he demanded from the UN security council never came. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, says it’s obvious what Putin wants: “Ukraine without Ukrainians.” More than 7.8 million people have fled as refugees since February, the UN estimates. Millions more are internally displaced. Concern grows about a second exodus. “Right now, across the country, people are facing a grim choice: flee or freeze,” said Jan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council. With temperatures falling as low as -20C (-4F), Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days so far”, the World Health Organization’s regional director, Hans Kluge, warned. “Put simply, this winter will be about survival.” Nato countries have provided generous billions in financial aid and weapons systems to Ukraine. But the pace is slowing. The EU’s latest sanctions package has been repeatedly diluted and delayed. It is bickering over a Russian oil price cap. The west is also struggling to meet Ukraine’s desperate need for anti-missile defences. Stocks of Stinger, S-300, Nasams, Hawk and Starstreak missiles are low. Supplies of more sophisticated systems, such as American Patriots and Germany’s Iris-T, are limited by production and training issues. If the US, Britain and others had heeded Zelenskiy’s pleas last spring for Nato-guaranteed safe havens or some form of defensive no-fly or air exclusion zones, Ukrainians might have been spared today’s missile hell. It’s not too late to act. As the war becomes a familiar fact of daily life, and negative fallout spreads, will public support soften further? Pro-Kyiv sentiment in Europe stands at about 57%, according to a Eupinions poll. But that figure is down on the summer – and the “peace camp” is advancing. For example, 60% of Germans favour diplomacy. In the US, satisfaction over Ukraine’s military successes has led, paradoxically, to complacency – and reduced focus on continuing threats. When Republicans take control in Congress in January, aid may be cut. In Ukraine itself, in contrast, public attitudes are hardening. Pride in the Ukrainian nation and pro-western, pro-EU sentiment have never been stronger – including among ethnic minority Russians. Overall, 89% of respondents in one survey accused Russia of genocide. The Ukrainian people are a formidable force. They have shown they can beat their enemies. But should they fear their friends? A weakening of US and European support, leaving Ukraine out in the cold, is perhaps the most dismaying hazard they face. Putin is counting on it. Might the peoples of the west, for the sake of a quiet life, really get “fed up” with the war to the point where they are ready to ignore or even tolerate mass murder, war crimes and the evisceration of a sovereign nation as the new normal? It’s democracy’s biggest test. Every day, it gets harder in Ukraine. One thing is certain: it’s going to be a long winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/23/zelenskiy-calls-on-japan-to-impose-trade-embargo-on-russian-goods","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-23T16:27:40Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy calls on Japan to impose trade embargo on Russian goods","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/zelenskiy-calls-on-japan-to-impose-trade-embargo-on-russian-goods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/23/zelenskiy-calls-on-japan-to-impose-trade-embargo-on-russian-goods","fields":{"headline":"Zelenskiy calls on Japan to impose trade embargo on Russian goods","bodyText":"The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on Japan to increase pressure on Russia by imposing a trade embargo on Russian goods, in a virtual address to MPs in Tokyo. Zelenskiy, who has delivered carefully tailored speeches to lawmakers in the US, UK and other countries, thanked Japan for “leading the way” among Asian countries in condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and imposing sanctions. “Responsible states unite to protect peace. I am grateful to your state for its principled position at such a historic moment, for real assistance to Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said on Wednesday in the first address of its kind to Japanese lawmakers. “You were the first in Asia who really began to put pressure on Russia to restore peace, who supported sanctions against Russia, and I urge you to keep doing this.” In a later address to French MPs he called on French companies including Renault and the supermarket group Auchan to leave Russia. He compared the destruction of Mariupol with “the ruins of Verdun as in the photos of the first world war that everyone has seen”. Zelenskiy claimed in his address to Japanese MPs that Russian forces were preparing to use chemical weapons and launch new attacks from the exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which Russian troops occupied last month in the early stages of the invasion. He offered no details, but said four of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were in a “dangerous” state. The Chernobyl plant suffered a catastrophic accident 25 years before the March 2011 meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in north-east Japan, although Zelenskiy did not mention Fukushima in his address. Japan has joined international sanctions against the Kremlin and offered humanitarian assistance. Its sanctions on 76 individuals, seven banks and 12 other bodies in Russia cover defence officials and the state-owned arms exporter Rosoboronexport. It has also said it will revoke Russia’s trade status of most favoured nation. Japan has also accepted a small number of Ukrainians fleeing the war and voiced a willingness to take more – a gesture that surprised many given its usually strict rules on refugees and asylum seekers. In response, Russia has labelled Japan an “unfriendly” country and this week said it was suspending negotiations over a longstanding territorial dispute that has prevented the two countries from signing a postwar peace treaty. Japan and Russia both lay claim to the Kuril islands – known as the Northern Territories in Japan – which were invaded by Soviet forces towards the end of the second world war. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, last week said Russia was “illegally occupying” the islands, located near Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido. “We also have to think about Ukraine’s recovery after the war, about the people who have been forced from their homes and their strong desire to return home,” Zelenskiy said. I think the people of Japan understand that feeling.” Zelenskiy had angered some conservative Japanese MPs when he invoked Pearl Harbor in appealing for more help from the US in a recent address to Congress. “Remember Pearl Harbor, terrible morning of 7 December 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you,” Zelensky said last week. “Just remember it, remember, September 11, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn US cities into battlefields, when innocent people were attacked from air, just like nobody else expected it and you could not stop it. Our country experiences the same, every day, right now at this moment.” On Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader received a standing ovation after his 12-minute address, which he ended by thanking his audience in Japanese."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/01/hinkley-point-b-nuclear-plant-could-be-spared-imminent-closure","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-01T13:04:40Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point B nuclear plant could be spared imminent closure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/01/hinkley-point-b-nuclear-plant-could-be-spared-imminent-closure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/01/hinkley-point-b-nuclear-plant-could-be-spared-imminent-closure","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point B nuclear plant could be spared imminent closure","bodyText":"Nuclear power advocates believe the energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is open to extending the life of the Hinkley Point B plant to help wean the UK off gas imports and prevent a faster-than-expected decline in Britain’s fleet of atomic reactors. Soaring gas prices and the war in Ukraine have already spurred the government to ask coal power plant owners to stay open longer, while ministers also revisited their staunch opposition to fracking in the light of energy supply concerns. There is a growing feeling in the nuclear industry and its supporters that Kwarteng could also be persuaded to back an extension of up to 18 months to the life of Hinkley Point B, which is due to stop generating electricity this summer. Such a plan, which would chime with Boris Johnson’s backing for new nuclear in the recent energy security plan, would keep 1GW of electricity generation on the National Grid in the short term, replacing the need for gas-fired generation for up to 1.5m homes. The Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, whose Bridgwater and West Somerset constituency includes Hinkley, said he had spoken to Kwarteng about the possibility and that he was “definitely” open to it. “Kwasi is no fool,” he said. “He understands the stresses and strains we’re going through and that we need to look at everything we can. They are fully aware of what the [Hinkley] B station is capable of. She’s old but she’s in good health.” Hinkley’s owner, EDF Energy, would have to produce a safety case for extending the life of a power station that was hooked up to the grid in 1976 and whose closure was previously postponed by seven years in 2012. EDF would have to prove to the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) that the ageing graphite cores of the plant’s reactors remain in good enough condition that control rods could be inserted, even in the event of a huge and unprecedented earthquake, to prevent a nuclear accident. One nuclear industry source said there was a “six-week window” left, during which EDF could still make that case in time for the ONR to give a verdict on the safety of the plans and postpone the scheduled end to Hinkley generating electricity on 15 July. Greg Hands, a junior minister in Kwarteng’s business and energy department (BEIS), visited Hinkley last week. Engineers there are understood to have told Hands that they expected the plant to shut as scheduled. But the nuclear industry source said that while engineers were naturally focused on shutdown plans they had been working towards for many months, senior figures at EDF were likely to be more open to extending Hinkley’s life. The ONR would ultimately decide on whether such a plan could go ahead but Kwarteng’s approval is crucial. This is because EDF would incur significant costs to put together a safety case for an extension and would need to be confident that ministers would not block it. EDF declined to comment on whether it was planning to do so. BEIS said it had not held any discussions about such a proposal. “It [extending Hinkley] would stop you having to import a chunk of gas,” said the nuclear industry source. The Guardian also understands that Torness, near Dunbar, and Heysham 2 in Lancashire could come off grid earlier than expected, depending on regular assessments of the state of their graphite cores. Their retirement has already been brought forward, with EDF saying earlier this year that they would stop generating in 2028, rather than 2030. In theory, each station that operates for a year can replace more than 1bn cubic metres of gas imports. While nuclear power is traditionally expensive, the sky-high price of gas in recent months, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, means the £45 per megawatt hour that EDF gets from its nuclear contract is significantly below wholesale market power prices. The trade unions Prospect and the GMB have also called for the life of Britain’s nuclear fleet to be extended. Pressure on Kwarteng to signal to EDF that the government would back plans to keep Hinkley Point B open comes against the backdrop of concern that the capacity of Britain’s nuclear fleet could be declining even faster than thought. Based on current projections for the retirement of reactors and the building of new ones, UK nuclear capacity will fall from 5.8GW today to 4.4GW in 2028, factoring in the construction of Hinkley Point C but also the end of life of Torness and Heysham. However, the 2028 completion date for Hinkley Point C, which is already over budget and behind schedule is under review, with a forecast due this summer. • This article was amended on 2 May 2022 to refer correctly to the graphite cores and control rods of reactors, rather than to graphite rods."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-15-missiles-shot-down-over-kyiv-as-victory-day-begins-in-russia","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-09T17:47:27Z","webTitle":"US and UK tell Russia to stop using hunger as leverage in Ukraine conflict – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-15-missiles-shot-down-over-kyiv-as-victory-day-begins-in-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-15-missiles-shot-down-over-kyiv-as-victory-day-begins-in-russia","fields":{"headline":"US and UK tell Russia to stop using hunger as leverage in Ukraine conflict – as it happened","bodyText":"The time is approaching 9pm in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Here’s a roundup of today’s news. Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine that the “whole country is praying for them”, as he used his Victory Day speech to defend his invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the 78th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president drew historical parallels between the second world war and fighting in Ukraine “Today, civilisation is again at a decisive, turning point, a real war has been unleashed against us again,” Putin said in a speech that was laced with anger. “We are proud of the participants of the special military operation. The future of our people depends on you,” Putin said. He accused the west of “destroying traditional values” and propagandising a “system of robbery and violence.” Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary force, which is fighting Russia’s battle in Bakhmut, has said he was told he and his mercenaries would be regarded as “traitors” if they abandoned their positions. Prigozhin threatened to withdraw his troops from the city in east Ukraine, which has been the site of a long-running battle since 2022 to try to capture it, because of a lack of ammunition. He then rowed back on it, but has again threatened to do so. The UK foreign secretary James Cleverly and US secretary of state Antony Blinken have urged Russia not to use hunger as a weapon of war, as discussions over the Black Sea grain deal continue. Blinken said: “In recent days, Russia has once again returned to blocking ships from sailing to Ukrainian ports to pick up grain. A cynical action, that directly results in less food getting to global food markets and to human beings in Africa, in the Middle East and around the world who need that food.The world shouldn’t need to remind Moscow every few weeks to stop using people’s hunger as a weapon in their war against Ukraine.” Russia launched about 15 cruise missiles at Ukraine’s capital on Tuesday, the second attack in as many days, with air defence systems shooting all of them down, officials said, after air raid alerts blared over most of the country. “As at the front, the plans of the aggressor failed,” Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv’s city military administration, said in comments posted on the Telegram messaging app. Popko said that according to preliminary information there were no casualties in the attack, which was carried out with cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea region. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said debris fell on a house in the Holosiivskyi district in the south-west of Kyiv, but there were no casualties and not much damage. Ukraine is planning a “very important” counteroffensive against Russian forces that must “demonstrate success”, the country’s prime minister has said. Denys Shmyhal told Sky News that the operation would be launched when the time was right. Cleverly warned that people should not get too carried away with their hopes for Ukraine’s counter offensive. “We have to be realistic. This is the real world; this is not a Hollywood movie,” he said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he discussed European integration, defence matters and sanctions against Russia at a meeting with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Kyiv. He said he expected the EU to soon approve more sanctions on Russia. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said there is currently no prospect of peace between Russia and Ukraine because “both sides are convinced that they can win”. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El País on Tuesday, Guterres was pessimistic about the EU and the UN’s ability to broker an end to the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion last year. “Unfortunately, I don’t think peace negotiations are possible at the moment,” he said. The US has announced a “new security assistance package” to help bolster Ukraine’s air defences and artillery ammunition needs. This package, confirmed by the Department of Defense on Tuesday, totals up to $1.2bn and is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). A UK-led group of European countries has asked for expressions of interest to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles. The call for responses from companies who could provide the munitions with range of up to 300km (190 miles) was included in a notice posted last week by the International Fund for Ukraine. MEPs voted to speed up consideration of a law to boost ammunition production in Europe to the tune of €500m ($550m), due to efforts to supply Ukraine. The decision should see the new legislation – snappily termed the Act in Support of Ammunition Production (Asap) – in place by the end of the year, MEPs and European Commission officials said, Agence France-Presse reports. Ukraine has received Israeli-made radar defence systems, which have already been deployed in Kyiv as of Monday, according to Israeli media reports. A Lithuanian volunteer organisation known as Blue/Yellow delivered 16 ieMHR models made by Israel’s RADA Electronic Industries last week and three are already in use in the Ukrainian capital, the Israeli daily Ha’aretz said. The systems are designed to detect aerial threats including missiles, rockets, mortar shells, helicopters and drones within up to a 10km (6.2-mile) radius. The EU must not be intimidated by Moscow’s showcasing of military power but continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Tuesday as Russia marked Victory Day with a parade. “Two thousand two hundred kilometres north-east from here, Putin is parading his soldiers, tanks and missiles today,” Scholz told lawmakers in a speech at the European parliament in Strasbourg. Germany’s foreign minister has said China could play a decisive role in ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking alongside her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, at a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, Annalena Baerbock said that as a permanent member of the UN security council, China had the power to be influential in the conflict and bring it to an end. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Russia “will prevail” in its fight against what he described as “imperialists”, the state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday, in remarks seen to be aimed at Ukraine and its western supporters such as the US. North Korea has forged closer ties with the Kremlin and backed Moscow after it invaded Ukraine last year, including its proclamation later of having annexed parts of Ukraine, which most UN members condemned as illegal. That’s all for today. Thank you for following along. The situation at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, is deteriorating, Funke Media Group has reported. According to Ukraine’s state-owned operating company Energoatom, Russia is bringing more troops and military vehicles to the site of the nuclear power plant, Reuters reports. “The situation of equipment and personnel is deteriorating,” the Energoatom president, Petro Kotin, told Funke. The UK foreign secretary and US secretary of state have urged Russia not to use global hunger as a tool of war in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, as discussions continue about the resumption of the Black Sea grain deal. Speaking at a joint press conference in Washington, James Cleverly and Antony Blinken spoke about the war, as well as relations with China and the recent evacuation of nationals in Sudan amid the country falling into civil war. Speaking first, Blinken said: “We are urging Russia to extend and expand the Black Sea grain initiative. In recent days, Russia has once again returned to blocking ships from sailing to Ukrainian ports to pick up grain. A cynical action, that directly results in less food getting to global food markets and to human beings in Africa, in the Middle East and around the world who need that food. “While we are grateful for the tireless efforts of [UN] general secretary Guterres, our colleagues in Turkey, working to break this impasse, the world shouldn’t need to remind Moscow every few weeks to stop using people’s hunger as a weapon in their war against Ukraine.” The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will visit the US in June, where he will meet Joe Biden in Washington. London will host the Ukraine rebuilding conference in the same month, in an attempt to examine how cities, towns and infrastructure will recover post-conflict. Cleverly struck the same tone. After thanking Blinken for his remarks, including congratulations sent to King Charles III on his coronation, the foreign secretary said: “Just as we did with Sudan, we remain focused on the needs of some of the poorest people in the world. I echo your comments on the Black Sea grain initiative. “It is completely wrong that Russia uses the hunger of some of the poorest people in the world to pursue leverage in this conflict. They should resign the Black Sea grain initiative and do so immediately, they should unlock the supply of food to go to those people around the world who need it most and it is perverse that they are using hunger in the developing world as leverage in their conflict in Ukraine.” Some more on the comments by James Cleverly in the US. The UK foreign secretary said that Ukraine’s offensive may not be “decisive” in an attempt to play down expectations of a “Hollywood” style sweep to retake occupied areas of the country. On a visit to Washington he said that more aid must be delivered, but added: “They have demonstrated themselves to be very, very effective defenders of their country, but we need to recognise that there might not be a simple, quick, decisive breakthrough,” Cleverly said at the Atlantic Council, Agence France-Presse reports. “I hope and expect they will do very, very well, because whenever I’ve seen the Ukrainians they have outperformed expectations. “But we have to be realistic. This is the real world; this is not a Hollywood movie,” he said. Cleverly called for western powers “to have the resolve to continue to do the right thing” no matter how the offensive progresses, including the prospect of “escalatory words” from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. “If we don’t, what’s at stake is of immeasurable importance,” he said. UK foreign secretary James Cleverly has told a US audience at the Atlantic Council that he would welcome China’s involvement in helping bring the war in Ukraine to an end. He said: “I don’t think we should be ‘dog in the manger’ about this. We know that Xi enjoys a significant degree of influence with Vladimir Putin. If he can use that influence to deliver on what he has publicly stated he feels strongly about, sovereignty, territorial integrity, the non-use of nuclear weapons, the non-threat of nuclear weapons, then why would we be critical of that intervention, if it is meaningful and if he actually delivers upon it. Two big ifs. “If through his intervention he can help restore the sovereignty of Ukraine, and get Russian troops out of that country, I’m not going to be critical of that.” A UK-led group of European countries has asked for expressions of interest to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles in what would be another step-up in military support for Kyiv against Russia’s invasion. The call for responses from companies who could provide the munitions with range of up to 300km (190 miles) was included in a notice posted last week by the International Fund for Ukraine – a group of countries including Britain, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden – set up to send weapons to Kyiv, Reuters reports. The UK’s Ministry of Defence, which runs the fund, asked companies to get in touch if they could provide missiles that can be launched from land, sea or air with a payload of between 20 and 490kg (44 and 1,078lbs). The notice asked for other desirable requirements including a “low probability of intercept”, “mission planning capability”, and “air defence penetration methods to increase probability of successful strike”. The notice said companies that responded would be contacted from 5 June. A British official said no final decision had been made to send missiles with these capabilities to Ukraine. The US has announced a “new security assistance package” to help bolster Ukraine’s air defences and artillery ammunition needs. This package, confirmed by the Department of Defense on Tuesday, totals up to $1.2bn and is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). In a statement this afternoon, the DoD said: This USAI package underscores the continued US commitment to meeting Ukraine’s most urgent requirements by committing critical near-term capabilities, such as air defence systems and munitions, while also building the capacity of Ukraine’s armed forces to defend its territory and deter Russian aggression over the long term. This includes committing additional 155mm artillery rounds and sustainment support to enable Ukraine to better maintain its on-hand systems and equipment. The package includes funding for additional air defence systems and munitions; equipment to integrate western air defence launchers, missiles and radars with Ukraine’s air defence systems; ammunition for counter-unmanned aerial systems; 155mm artillery rounds; commercial satellite imagery services; and support for training, maintenance and sustainment activities. A large installation representing Russian atrocities in Ukraine blocked the path of Russia’s ambassador to Poland as he sought to place a wreath at a Warsaw memorial to Soviet soldiers on Russia’s Victory Day holiday. The installation included hundreds of fluttering blue and yellow Ukrainian flags and crosses serving as symbolic grave markers for Ukrainians killed by Russians during the full-scale war launched by Moscow last year. A pool of fake blood below the crosses underlined the stark message of the protest, which was created by Euromaidan-Warszawa, a citizens’ initiative that supports Ukraine. One organiser, Viktoria Pogrebniak, said the installation, set up for the day at the entrance to the Red Army memorial site, was meant to fight back against Russian propaganda and “show the real picture to the world”. “We are bombed, we are killed, we are raped,” she said. “We are killed just because we are Ukrainians.” A tumultuous year of fighting has passed since Vladimir Putin last addressed Russian soldiers on Red Square in Moscow to mark the country’s victory over the Nazis. But the Russian leader’s Victory Day message to the nation on Tuesday was nearly identical to that of last year, as he cast the war in Ukraine as an existential battle against an aggressive, Russophobic and woke west. “Today, civilisation is again at a decisive turning point. A real war has been unleashed against us again,” Putin said as he delivered an angry yet somewhat routine speech in which he drew false parallels between today’s fight with Ukraine’s “criminal regime” and the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. Putin also recycled some of his other go-to grievances, blaming “western globalist elites” for “destroying the family” and “traditional values”. What was left unspoken by the Russian president was the battering his army had received over the last 12 months in Ukraine, the impact of which was revealed by the scaled-down military parade that followed his speech. It’s 4.20pm in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the day’s news so far: Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine that the “whole country is praying for them”, as he used his Victory Day speech to defend his invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the 78th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president drew historical parallels between the second world war and fighting in Ukraine “Today, civilisation is again at a decisive, turning point, a real war has been unleashed against us again,” Putin said in a speech that was laced with anger. “We are proud of the participants of the special military operation.

Russia may be building a water pipeline in an attempt to address a water shortage affecting the occupied city of Donetsk. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its daily update that water had been a growing issue for Donetsk since the invasion in February 2022. On 28 April, the Russian-installed head of Donetsk said regional supplies were running “dangerously low”. The Siversky-Donets canal that supplies the area is mainly under Ukrainian control, despite Russian attempts to take command of it. MEPs voted to speed up consideration of a law to boost ammunition production in Europe to the tune of €500m ($550m), due to efforts to supply Ukraine. The decision should see the new legislation – snappily termed the Act in Support of Ammunition Production (Asap) – in place by the end of the year, MEPs and European Commission officials said, Agence France-Presse reports.

The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Russia “will prevail” in its fight against what he described as “imperialists”, the state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday, in remarks seen to be aimed at Ukraine and its western supporters such as the US. North Korea has forged closer ties with the Kremlin and backed Moscow after it invaded Ukraine last year, including its proclamation later of having annexed parts of Ukraine, which most UN members condemned as illegal. The leaders of the G7 nations must condemn any threat to use nuclear weapons and vow “decisive action” against such a move when they hold a summit next week in the city of Hiroshima, Ukraine’s envoy to Japan said. Nuclear tension has surged since the start of the conflict with Ukraine as Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Russia is ready to use its nuclear arsenal if necessary to defend its “territorial integrity”. Russia may be building a water pipeline in an attempt to address a water shortage affecting the occupied city of Donetsk. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its daily update that water had been a growing issue for Donetsk since the invasion in February 2022. On 28 April, the Russian-installed head of Donetsk said regional supplies were running “dangerously low”. The Siversky-Donets canal that supplies the area is mainly under Ukrainian control, despite Russian attempts to take command of it. It runs near the city of Bakhmut, which has seen heavy fighting from both sides as Russia tries to take it. The MoD said: “Russia’s heavy use of indirect artillery to support the capture of Bakhmut … has likely inflicted collateral damage to the canal and other regional water infrastructure, undermining Russia’s efforts to remedy the lack of water that its invasion originally created. “To compensate for its lack of success in capture and retaining the canal, Russia is likely constructing a water pipeline to mitigate the water shortage within Donetsk city. However, this is unlikely to fully compensate for the occupied region’s reduced access to water.” Germany’s foreign minister has said China could play a decisive role in ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking alongside her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, at a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, Annalena Baerbock said that as a permanent member of the UN security council, China had the power to be influential in the conflict and bring it to an end. Her comments were rebuffed by Qin, who said China would neither “watch the fire from the other bank” nor “add fuel to the fire”. Baerbock said the EU was still working on ways to stop sanctions on Russian businesses and individuals being circumvented, including by using indirect companies in other countries. She was asked whether the measures would include a proposed blacklisting of several Chinese companies. In response she said negotiations were ongoing but that generally it was important to stop restrictions from being bypassed. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary force which is fighting Russia’s battle in Bakhmut, has said he was told that he and his mercenaries would be regarded as “traitors” if they abandoned their positions. Prigozhin threatened to withdraw his troops from the city in east Ukraine, which has been the site of a long-running battle since 2022 to try to capture it, because of a lack of ammunition. He since rowed back on it, but again threatened to do so unless he got it. His latest comments were released on Russia’s Victory Day, as a military parade took place in the capital, Moscow. He said: “A combat order came yesterday which clearly stated that if we leave our positions it will be regarded as treason against the motherland. That was the message to us. “[But] if there is no ammunition, then we will leave our positions and be the ones asking who is really betraying the motherland. Apparently, the one [betraying Russia] is the person who signed it [the order to supply too little ammunition].” He said his forces would stay in Bakhmut and keep insisting they get their ammo “for a few more days”. Prigozhin has previously accused the defence ministry of deliberately starving his forces of ammunition. The ministry has said it is working to ensure all battlefield units have what they need. Late on Monday, Prigozhin said there were signs the ammunition problem was being solved, but on Tuesday he said the size of the shipment had been slashed. “They’ve given us only 10% of what we asked for. We’ve been deceived,” he said. More details from Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s press conference alongside the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Kyiv on Tuesday. He was heavily critical of restrictions on the import of grain into the EU imposed after complaints by a group of five central and eastern European countries. He said the ban was helping Russia. He said: “All restrictions on our exports are completely unacceptable right now. They only reinforce the abilities of the aggressor. We are waiting for the EU to stop all restrictions as fast as possible.” Agence France-Presse said he called the measures “severe, even cruel” and “disappointing” in a time of war. The EU members involved – Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia – have sparred with Ukraine in recent weeks over the issue of grain. Russia’s invasion last year severely limited the traditional export channel of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea, necessitating export overland via Ukraine’s neighbours. Member states agreed to allow the import of certain products from Ukraine without quantitative restrictions, and without customs and official inspections. But farmers in some of the EU countries protested after a slump in prices, prompting a raft of restrictions and bans on Ukraine’s food exports in response. Brussels called the bans on imports of grain and other food from Ukraine “unacceptable” while Kyiv is at war with Russia. Last month, the European Commission reached an agreement with all the parties concerned to ensure the transit of Ukrainian grain exports through EU countries, but with restrictions. Speaking alongside Zelenskiy, Von der Leyen on Tuesday described the grain situation as “difficult”. “The immediate priority now is that the grain transit goes seamlessly and at the lowest possible cost outside from Ukraine towards the European Union,” she said. “This requires a very close cooperation of the different stakeholders. Therefore, we will jointly set up a coordination platform.” MEPs voted to speed up consideration of a law to boost ammunition production in Europe to the tune of €500m ($550m), due to efforts to supply Ukraine. The decision should see the new legislation – snappily termed the Act in Support of Ammunition Production (Asap) – in place by the end of the year, MEPs and European Commission officials said, Agence France-Presse reports. The spending proposal, initiated by the commission, comes as the bloc seeks to supply 1 million artillery shells to Ukraine over the next 12 months, adding to a stream of military deliveries. But shifting such quantities of munitions to Ukraine has severely depleted stocks in EU member countries’ arsenals, creating the need for the new ammunition-production act. The Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, in a joint news conference in Kyiv with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Asap law would “help member states to ramp up the production … and speed up the delivery of ammunition to meet Ukraine’s and member states’ needs”. The draft legislation calls for tapping the EU’s European defence fund and another mechanism the commission has suggested creating under a July 2022 proposal, called the European Defence Industrial Reinforcement Through Common Procurement Act. In a first, Ukraine has received Israeli-made radar defence systems, which have already been deployed in Kyiv as of Monday, according to Israeli media reports. A Lithuanian volunteer organisation known as Blue/Yellow delivered 16 ieMHR models made by Israel’s RADA Electronic Industries last week and three are already in use in the Ukrainian capital, the Israeli daily Ha’aretz said. The systems are designed to detect aerial threats including missiles, rockets, mortar shells, helicopters and drones within up to a 10km (6.2-mile) radius. The models function as an alert system, and do not have interception capabilities. According to the Blue/Yellow group, the mobile and stationary systems will be used mainly to protect critical installations and infrastructure. Israel has provided millions in humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the invasion began last February. However, wary of the need to maintain relations with Russia – which facilitates Israeli operations against Iranian-backed actors in Syria – it had refrained from sending military materiel despite repeated requests from Kyiv and Washington. The Russian deployment of Iranian-made drones, however, appears to have toughened Israel’s position. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was reelected in November, had also pledged to reassess the country’s stance on the war. Israel has offered to assist Kyiv in creating a “life-saving civilian early-warning system” to protect against aerial attack and has reportedly shared intelligence on Iran’s drone programme. Export licences for two Israeli companies to sell defence systems with a 40km range were approved in March, Israel’s Walla news site reported, citing three Israeli and Ukranian officials. Previous Russian Victory Day military parades have seen a fleet of tanks processing through Moscow’s Red Square in a show of military strength. In contrast on Tuesday, only one was on show, a T-34 Soviet-era tank. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he discussed European integration, defence matters and sanctions against Russia at a meeting with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Kyiv. He said he expected the EU to soon approve more sanctions on Russia. He also expected the EU to remove trade restrictions on grain imports from Ukraine, after the trading bloc put measures in place after complaints from Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Bulgaria. Zelenskiy told reporters the moves were “harsh” and “protectionist”. He added that he expected a “positive appraisal” of Ukraine joining the EU at its summit in June, and he thanked European countries for the promise of 1m artillery shells. Ukraine is planning a “very important” counteroffensive against Russian forces that must “demonstrate success”, the country’s prime minister has said. Denys Shmyhal told Sky News that the operation would be launched when the time was right. Sky reported: Mr Shmyhal visited a British military training area on Salisbury Plain to watch British and New Zealand troops helping to train Ukrainian recruits as part of a British-led assistance programme to turn thousands of Ukrainian civilians into soldiers. Asked whether some of the recruits learning shooting and other skills would be part of the counter-offensive when they returned to Ukraine, the prime minister, speaking in English, said: “On this training base, our future soldiers – guys and girls – are … having all special knowledge and experiences, practical experiences, for the battlefield.” As for why it was taking so long for the Ukrainian military officially to begin its offensive, Mr Shmyhal said: “We are preparing very carefully because it’s a very important operation and we understand that we should demonstrate success in this operation to our society, to our partners, to all the world [and] to our enemy.” The EU must not be intimidated by Moscow’s showcasing of military power but continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Tuesday as Russia marked Victory Day with a parade. “Two thousand two hundred kilometres north-east from here, Putin is parading his soldiers, tanks and missiles today,” Scholz told lawmakers in a speech at the European parliament in Strasbourg. “We must not be intimidated by such power plays. Let’s remain steadfast in our support for Ukraine – for as long as it takes.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said there is currently no prospect of peace between Russia and Ukraine because “both sides are convinced that they can win”. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El País on Tuesday, Guterres was pessimistic about the EU and the UN’s ability to broker an end to the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion last year. “Unfortunately, I don’t think peace negotiations are possible at the moment,” he said. “Both sides are convinced they can win. This was a Russian invasion that was against international law and against the United Nations charter, but I don’t see Russia being willing to pull out of the territories it’s occupying at the moment and I think Ukraine is hoping to retake them.” Guterres said the UN was instead doing what it could “to have a dialogue with both sides to solve concrete problems”, such as Ukrainian grain exports and Russian food and fertiliser exports. The secretary general played down hopes of Chinese or Brazilian mediation to bring about an end to hostilities. “I’ve already said that peace negotiations aren’t going to happen at the moment,” he said. “But I hope they will in the future. There was talk of a Russian winter offensive and a Ukrainian one in the spring; it’s clear that both sides are completely involved in the war.” Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine that the “whole country is praying for them”, as he used his Victory Day speech to defend his invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the 78th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president drew historical parallels between the second world war and fighting in Ukraine “Today, civilisation is again at a decisive, turning point, a real war has been unleashed against us again,” Putin said in a speech that was laced with anger. “We are proud of the participants of the special military operation. The future of our people depends on you,” he said. Putin accused the west of “destroying traditional values” and propagandising a “system of robbery and violence.” “The goal of our enemies, and there is nothing new here, is to achieve the disintegration and destruction of our country,” he said. More than 500 Russian soldiers who fought in Ukraine were present at the parade, according to state media. Six leaders of former Soviet states were also present. In a surprise move on Monday, the heads of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Armenia – three post-Soviet countries that Moscow strives to keep in its orbit – announced that they would attend the military parade on Red Square alongside Putin. “Here is to our victory!,” Putin exclaimed before returning to his seat. Vladimir Putin said a “real war” was again being waged against Russia, as he invoked the Soviet Union’s victory in the second world war to say the west was trying to destroy his country. In a speech on Red Square as part of Russia’s Victory Day celebrations, Putin said Russia wanted to see a peaceful future, and said the entire country was behind what Russia calls the “special military operation” in Ukraine. Putin said the west had forgotten the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. Vladimir Putin has started his speech as part of Russia’s Victory Day celebrations in Moscow this morning. The president walked from the Kremlin to Red Square to be greeted by massed ranks of military personnel on Tuesday as the start of a Victory Day celebrations to mark the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. Victory Day is one of the most important public holidays in Russia, when people commemorate the huge sacrifices made by the Soviet Union during what is called the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45, in which about 27 million citizens died. This anniversary is even more emotionally charged as Russia mourns thousands of soldiers killed in the nearly 15-month war in Ukraine, which shows no sign of ending. Here are some images from Russia’s Victory Day parade in Moscow today. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Russia “will prevail” in its fight against what he described as “imperialists”, the state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday, in remarks seen to be aimed at Ukraine and its western supporters such as the US. North Korea has forged closer ties with the Kremlin and backed Moscow after it invaded Ukraine last year, including its proclamation later of having annexed parts of Ukraine, which most UN members condemned as illegal. “We send warm wishes to you, the Russian army and the people of Russia for their holy fight to preserve world peace,” the agency quoted Kim as telling Vladimir Putin in a letter. Kim also congratulated Putin on Tuesday’s Victory Day anniversary that celebrates the 1945 defeat of Nazi Germany, saying Russia would continue to protect its “autonomy” and the “stability of the region”. The leaders of the G7 nations must condemn any threat to use nuclear weapons and vow “decisive action” against such a move when they hold a summit next week in the city of Hiroshima, Ukraine’s envoy to Japan said. Nuclear tension has surged since the start of the conflict with Ukraine as Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Russia is ready to use its nuclear arsenal if necessary to defend its “territorial integrity”. Sergiy Korsunsky also told Reuters that conditions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had deteriorated rapidly, a situation the head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog warned at the weekend had become “potentially dangerous”. “It should be a very clear statement from specifically those nuclear powers among the G7 that the use of nuclear weapons or nuclear terrorism will not be tolerated and will be met with almost decisive actions from major powers,” he said. The envoy’s comments came as Russia launched drone, missile and airstrikes on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and other cities in the run-up to its cherished Victory Day holiday today that celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will attend by video link the G7 gathering from 19-21 May in Hiroshima, which in 1945 became the first city to be hit by an atomic bomb, adding significance to his country’s message. “It’s most important that the summit, when we have a real threat of nuclear terrorism, that summit will be in Hiroshima,” Korsunsky added. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has arrived in Kyiv, where she will meet Zelenskiy. Ukraine will be celebrating “Europe Day” along with the countries of the European Union it hopes to join. This year’s Victory Day in Russia is emotionally charged, Reuters reports, as the country mourns thousands of soldiers killed in the nearly 15-month war in Ukraine that shows no sign of ending. Russia is also reeling from drone attacks, including one on the Kremlin on 3 May that it said was an attempt to assassinate Vladimir Putin. Ukraine denies involvement. Putin has repeatedly likened the Ukraine war – which he casts as a battle against Nazi-inspired nationalists – to the challenge the Soviet Union faced when Hitler invaded in 1941. Ukraine says this is absurd and accuses Russia of behaving like Nazi Germany by waging an unprovoked war of aggression and seizing Ukrainian territory. There have been reports of fewer soldiers and less military hardware joining this year’s parade as the Ukraine conflict takes a heavy toll on men and equipment. Authorities nationwide have cancelled the “Immortal Regiment” processions, where people carry portraits of relatives who fought against the Nazis. Dame Melinda Simmons has posted a photograph of dawn in Kyiv this morning, after another night of air raid sirens and sheltering. “I guess one advantage of an early morning air raid is the chance to see this,” she wrote. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has condemned this morning’s attack, saying in a tweet: “Ukraine, Europe, and the United States commemorated victory over tyranny yesterday. Russia marks May 9 with more missiles and drones launched toward Ukrainian cities and sleeping civilians.” Ukraine’s armed forces have just said in their update that 25 missiles were launched by Russia across Ukraine overnight, with 23 of those shot down. Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv’s city military administration, said that according to preliminary information there were no casualties in the attack that was carried out with cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea region. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said debris fell on a house in the Holosiivskyi district in the south-west of Kyiv, but there were no casualties and not much damage. In the often-targeted Shevchenkivskyi district of central Kyiv, debris was found on a road, Reuters reports. “Kyiv stood up again and will stand up in the future!” Popko said. Russia launched about 15 cruise missiles at Ukraine’s capital on Tuesday, the second attack in as many days, with air defence systems shooting all of them down, officials said, after air raid alerts blared over most of the country. “As at the front, the plans of the aggressor failed,” Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv’s city military administration, said in comments posted on the Telegram messaging app. Tuesday’s attacks came a day after Russia launched its biggest drone swarm yet in a renewed air campaign unleashed 10 days ago after a lull since early March, Reuters reports. It also came on Russia’s Victory Day, one its most commemorated public holidays, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. “[They] try to kill as many civilians as possible – on this day,” Popko said. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Russia launched 15 cruise missiles at Ukraine’s capital on Tuesday, the second attack in as many days, with air defence systems shooting all of them down, officials said, after air raid alerts blared over most of the country. “As at the front, the plans of the aggressor failed,” Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv’s city military administration, said in comments posted on the Telegram messaging app. Tuesday’s attacks came on Russia’s Victory Day, one its most commemorated public holidays, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. “[They] try to kill as many civilians as possible – on this day,” Popko said. Here are the other key recent developments in the war: A Russian missile strike overnight on Monday destroyed a Red Cross warehouse containing aid in Odesa. The Odesa regional organisation of the Red Cross society said workers and volunteers were not in the 1,000 sq metre unit at the time. “The provision of humanitarian aid and the activities of some projects of the Odesa Regional Organisation of the Red Cross of Ukraine have been suspended,” the statement added. On Monday at least five people were wounded by Russian strikes on Kyiv, city officials said, as Moscow launched another large-scale attack on Ukraine. Kyiv’s mayor said Russia fired 60 Iranian-made kamikaze drones early on Monday, including 36 at Kyiv, all of which had been shot down. However, debris hit apartments and other buildings, injuring at least five people. Russia has in effect stopped the Black Sea grain deal, which expires on 18 May, by refusing to register incoming vessels, Ukraine’s reconstruction ministry said. Moscow has threatened to quit the agreement, which is meant to help ease a global food crisis. About 100,000 Russian soldiers have died in the battle to capture Bakhmut, a Ukrainian general has claimed. Col Serhiy Cherevaty, the spokesperson for the eastern group of the armed forces of Ukraine, told Ukrainian TV they were “rough calculations”. He said: “I am sure that further verification will only show an increase in this number. This is natural as the enemy uses the so-called meat assaults as the main method of waging war.” Russia’s Wagner mercenary group appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut, saying they had been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged eastern Ukrainian city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Russia’s Victory Day on Tuesday. Russian investigators have charged a man with terrorism offences after a car bombing wounded a prominent Russian nationalist writer. The explosion in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia, on Saturday, broke both legs of Zakhar Prilepin, an ardent supporter of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. A close associate who was in the car with him was killed. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv on Tuesday, the European Commission announced. The EU could impose penalties on countries helping Moscow dodge western sanctions as part of a drive to close loopholes in the regime of restrictions on the Russian economy. A draft EU regulation seen by the Guardian proposes that non-EU countries could be included in future sanctions if shown to be at “particularly high risk of being used for circumvention against Russia”. A total of 1,679 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a Moscow-installed official in the Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the past three years, according to UK intelligence. The EU’s executive has proposed blacklisting several Chinese companies and curbing exports to nations seen as involved in bypassing Russia trade restrictions under new sanctions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-denies-wagner-claims-of-bakhmut-breakthrough-by-ukraine","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-12T17:49:44Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zelenskiy thanks UK for Storm Shadow missiles; Kremlin denies ground lost in Bakhmut – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-denies-wagner-claims-of-bakhmut-breakthrough-by-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-denies-wagner-claims-of-bakhmut-breakthrough-by-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zelenskiy thanks UK for Storm Shadow missiles; Kremlin denies ground lost in Bakhmut – as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is almost 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s stories: In a tweet, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked the British prime minister Rishi Sunak for the provision of long-range cruise missiles. Yesterday, the UK defence secretary Ben Wallace confirmed that the UK would send long-range cruise missiles. Two Russian pilots were killed on Friday when a Russian Mi-28 military helicopter crashed in the annexed peninsula of Crimea, Russian news agencies reported, citing the defence ministry. The defence ministry said it believed the reason for the crash was equipment failure, the TASS news agency reported. Russia’s defence ministry has said some of its troops fell back “to more advantageous defensive positions” near a reservoir north-west of the east Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. The statement on Friday was the first admission by Moscow that Ukraine was successfully recapturing ground around Bakhmut, a largely destroyed city with a prewar population of about 70,000 that Russia has been trying to conquer for more than 10 months. Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose troops have done the bulk of the fighting in and around Bakhmut, said via his press service that what the defence ministry had described was in fact a “rout” which had seen troops flee. He said Ukraine had been able to completely regain control of a crucial supply road that links Bakhmut with the town of Chasiv Yar and had seized useful higher ground, Reuters reported. Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive to win back territory occupied by Russia has a good chance of success but may bring high casualties if Russia uses its prepared defences well, Czech president and former Nato general Petr Pavel said on Friday. Pavel, 61, said in an interview that Ukraine needs support for Nato and European Union entry but joining either will be a lengthy process, though talks on the EU accession could start this year, Reuters reported. Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit to detect unmanned drones after a suspected attack on the Kremlin earlier this month, Reuters reports. The unit launched on 9 May during the annual the second world war victory day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow had never refused the “diplomatic track” to resolving the conflict in Ukraine in a phone call with his South African counterpart, the Kremlin said. Putin said he supported South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s proposal to involve African leaders in talks regarding a peace process for Ukraine, according to the Kremlin’s readout of the call. Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday that Ukrainian forces carried out “offensive operations” on Thursday along the entire line of contact near Soledar, the ministry’s official Zvezda news outlet reported. More than a thousand troops and up to 40 tanks were used in the assault, it said, adding that the attacks were “repulsed”. UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have told Reuters. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic nuclear accident from military activity like shelling at Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which is in Ukraine and has been occupied by Russia for more than a year. A Russian defeat in Ukraine will not derail China’s rise, while relations between Beijing and the EU will be “critically affected” if Xi Jinping does not push Vladimir Putin to withdraw his forces, European ministers have been told. The message comes in a paper drawn up by the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who is meeting the EU’s 27 foreign ministers on Friday in Stockholm to discuss how the bloc should “recalibrate” its policy towards Beijing. Russia’s defence ministry has denied reports that Ukrainian forces had broken through in various places along the frontlines and said the military situation was under control. Moscow was reacting after Russian military bloggers, writing on the Telegram messaging app, reported apparent Ukrainian advances north and south of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, with some suggesting a long-awaited counteroffensive by pro-Kyiv forces had started. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had earlier said the offensive had yet to start. Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, has said that parties to the Black Sea grain initiative are approaching an extension. Akar’s comment was released by his ministry in a statement on Friday, after talks in Istanbul. Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Musiyenko says Kyiv’s backers understand that a counteroffensive “may not result in the complete eviction of Russian troops and the definitive defeat of Russia in all occupied areas”. “We have to be ready for the war to continue into next year - or it could end this year,” Musiyenko told Ukrainian NV Radio. “It all depends on how the battles develop. We can’t guarantee how the counter-offensive will develop.” The Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Donetsk has reported on Telegram that one person was killed by Ukrainian shelling of the city overnight. The commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has said its defences are being tightened amid a flurry of Ukrainian drone strikes targeting its home base, the Crimean port of Sevastopol. V-Adm Viktor Sokolov told Friday’s edition of the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda: “In connection with the threat of attacks by robotic surface and underwater systems, we have increased the technical defences of the fleet’s main base and of the ships’ anchorages”. Sokolov said the Black Sea Fleet, whose flagship, the cruiser Moskva, was sunk by Ukraine in April 2022, would receive four new ships in 2023. China’s foreign ministry has announced that its special representative of Eurasian affairs will visit Ukraine, Poland, France, Germany and Russia from Monday in what it calls “an effort to promote peace talks”, US President Joe Biden and Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez will discuss Ukraine, defence cooperation, and migration on Friday during a meeting at the White House. While Madrid agrees with Washington on the illegality of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Sánchez will convey the divergent views of China and Brazil and propose giving greater weight to the views of non-Nato nations hurt by the war, a Spanish diplomatic source told Reuters. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine war live blog for today. Thanks for following along. UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have told Reuters. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic nuclear accident from military activity like shelling at Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which is in Ukraine and has been occupied by Russia for more than a year. With Ukraine preparing a counteroffensive in the area, there is a risk that fighting near the plant and its six reactors will intensify. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling that has repeatedly downed power lines vital to cooling the reactors and preventing a nuclear meltdown. “It looks promising,” one diplomat said about securing an agreement. Others said Ukraine, which long opposed the plan, now backed it while Russia’s position was less clear. Russia’s defence ministry has said some of its troops fell back “to more advantageous defensive positions” near a reservoir north-west of the east Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. The statement on Friday was the first admission by Moscow that Ukraine was successfully recapturing ground around Bakhmut, a largely destroyed city with a prewar population of about 70,000 that Russia has been trying to conquer for more than 10 months. The Russian defence statement came hours after Kyiv said that its forces had advanced by about 2km (1.2 miles) around Bakhmut this week. Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, said on Friday: “The enemy suffered great losses of manpower. Our defenders advanced 2km in the Bakhmut sector. We did not lose a single position in Bakhmut this week.” It came as Russia’s foreign ministry condemned the UK for supplying Ukraine with the long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles that Kyiv wants to boost its chances in a counteroffensive – the first western country to do so. Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive to win back territory occupied by Russia has a good chance of success but may bring high casualties if Russia uses its prepared defences well, Czech president and former Nato general Petr Pavel said on Friday. Pavel, 61, said in an interview that Ukraine needs support for Nato and European Union entry but joining either will be a lengthy process, though talks on the EU accession could start this year, Reuters reported. Pavel, who was Czech army chief and also the principal military adviser to the Nato secretary-general in 2015-2018, said Ukraine would eventually get western fighter jets it has been calling for but it was impossible to deliver them in time for the upcoming offensive, and there were higher priorities such as ammunition. “There is certainly high hope that the Ukrainian counteroffensive will be successful, because Ukraine is motivated, well prepared, its troops are experienced and certainly do not succumb to such deficiencies as the Russian army,” Pavel said at Prague Castle, the seat of the Czech presidency. The Russian army had severe problems in logistics and morale, but a collapse of defences should not be expected, he said. “Russia has had time to prepare a relatively high-quality and in-depth defence in several lines, which, if used effectively, will cost … Ukraine large casualties,” he said. It was impossible to say what size of territory Ukraine could win back as various scenarios were open, he said. “Things do not always go according to wishes and plans but I think that the chance for a significant Ukrainian success is really high.” White House national security council spokesperson John Kirby said on Friday that the Biden administration has consistently urged countries not to provide weapons for Russia’s war with Ukraine when asked about US allegations that South Africa sent an arms shipment to Russia. Kirby declined to talk specifically on the South Africa issue, but said “it’s a serious issue.” A Russian defeat in Ukraine will not derail China’s rise, while relations between Beijing and the EU will be “critically affected” if Xi Jinping does not push Vladimir Putin to withdraw his forces, European ministers have been told. The message comes in a paper drawn up by the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who is meeting the EU’s 27 foreign ministers on Friday in Stockholm to discuss how the bloc should “recalibrate” its policy towards Beijing. Along with the war in Ukraine, relations with China have become Europe’s most pressing foreign policy issue, but EU politicians take different approaches on how to respond to an increasingly repressive and nationalistic Beijing – revealed in the furore over Emmanuel Macron’s comments about not being drawn into a US-China clash over Taiwan. In a letter to ministers to accompany the paper, Borrell highlights at least three reasons to adjust the EU’s approach: China’s internal changes “with nationalism and ideology on the rise”; the “hardening of US-China competition” in all areas and China’s status as a key regional and global player. Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow had never refused the “diplomatic track” to resolving the conflict in Ukraine in a phone call with his South African counterpart, the Kremlin said. Putin said he supported South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s proposal to involve African leaders in talks regarding a peace process for Ukraine, according to the Kremlin’s readout of the call. He also repeated an offer to deliver Russian grain and fertilisers free of charge to African countries, Reuters reported. It came as South Africa’s foreign ministry summoned the US ambassador over allegations he made that the country had provided arms and ammunition to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Amid the diplomatic fallout, South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, would also speak with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation said in a statement posted on Twitter. The US ambassador, Reuben Brigety, said at a press conference on Thursday that South Africa had loaded weapons and ammunition on to a sanctioned Russian vessel at the Simon’s Town Naval Base near the city of Cape Town in December last year. The arms were then transported to Russia, Brigety said. Two Russian pilots were killed on Friday when a Russian Mi-28 military helicopter crashed in the annexed peninsula of Crimea, Russian news agencies reported, citing the defence ministry. The defence ministry said it believed the reason for the crash was equipment failure, the TASS news agency reported. The crash occurred at 3.42pm local time during a training flight, and the helicopter was flying without weapons, news agencies cited the defence ministry as saying in a statement. An investigation was opened to confirm the cause of the crash, which occurred in the Dzhankoi region of northern Crimea. Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose troops have done the bulk of the fighting in and around Bakhmut, said via his press service that what the defence ministry had described was in fact a “rout” which had seen troops flee. He said Ukraine had been able to completely regain control of a crucial supply road that links Bakhmut with the town of Chasiv Yar and had seized useful higher ground, Reuters reported. The risk, he said, was that if more ground was lost Ukrainian forces could gradually encircle Bakhmut. Prigozhin, who has been openly feuding with Russia’s defence ministry for months, has repeatedly accused the top brass of sabotaging Wagner’s push for Bakhmut and this week accused them of doing too little to protect Bakhmut’s flanks. The ministry appeared to push back against that assertion on Friday, saying that Ukrainian attempts to counterattack Bakhmut’s flanks were being repelled. Prigozhin complained his men were still not getting enough shells and equipment, but said they were still advancing in Bakhmut and only needed to capture around a further 20 buildings to take full control of the city. Bakhmut, much of which now lies in ruins, has been the focus of fierce fighting for months. In a tweet, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked the British prime minister Rishi Sunak for the provision of long-range cruise missiles. He said: Had a phone call with UK prime minister Rishi Sunak. Thanked for the significant enhancement of our capabilities with long-range Storm Shadow missiles and other irreplaceable military assistance. We discussed further defence cooperation and coordinated our positions on the eve of upcoming international events. In particular, we need clear signals about Ukraine’s future with Nato. Yesterday, the UK defence secretary Ben Wallace confirmed that the UK would send long-range cruise missiles. Zelenskiy is expected to attend the next Nato summit in Vilnius in July, but has repeatedly requested for a firmer time table and more concrete steps for Ukraine to join the alliance. Belgium will use €92m (£81m/$101m) it has received in taxes on frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine, its government said on Friday, Reuters reports. Half of the amount will be used to deliver military goods such as armoured vehicles, weapons and munition. The rest is earmarked for humanitarian support, the future reconstruction of Ukraine and strengthening Belgium’s diplomatic presence in the country, the government said. Rishi Sunak is disappointed that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s request to address the Eurovision song contest was refused, the UK prime minister’s spokesperson said on Friday. Ukraine’s president had requested to make a video appearance during the final on Saturday in Liverpool. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said on Thursday that while Zelenskiy’s request was made with “laudable intentions”, granting it would be against the non-political nature of the event and its rules prohibiting making political statements. “The prime minister believes it would be fitting for President Zelenskiy to address the event and we are disappointed by the decision,” Sunak’s spokesperson said. “The value and freedoms that President Zelenskiy and the people of Ukraine are fighting for are not political, they are fundamental. Eurovision themselves recognised that last year when they rightly suspended Russia’s participation from the competition.” Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit to detect unmanned drones after a suspected attack on the Kremlin earlier this month, Reuters reports. The unit launched on 9 May during the annual the second world war victory day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. In a video message, Roman Uvarov, the department’s head, said it will “ensure the protection of public order” during large public events. The unit will include officers armed with snipers and carbines, groups trained to neutralise unmanned drones, and mobile patrols to detain those suspected of operating drones. Two Russian strategic bombers have conducted routine flights over the Chukchi Sea between Siberia and Alaska, the Tass news agency said on Friday. “In the course of the flight, the crews of the long-range aircraft carried out aerial refuelling,” Tass quoted the defence ministry as saying. At a secret location in southern Ukraine, Roman Kostenko watched a drone rise into the sky. It ascended to a height of 100 metres, buzzing above a yellow rapeseed field. The drone dropped a dummy anti-tank grenade on to a pile of tyres. The test worked. That night Kostenko’s team repeated the exercise over occupied territory. Two bombs fell on a Russian armoured fighting vehicle. It blew up, smoke pluming into darkness. Kostenko, a decorated special forces colonel, said his unit had destroyed dozens of Russian military objects. They included tanks and howitzer guns. These operations took place every night on “a tactical level”, he said, close to the frontline. This stretches for 900 miles, from the eastern city of Bakhmut where Ukrainian troops launched a local counterattack this week, to the southern provinces of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. There has been intense speculation that Kyiv is about to launch a major counteroffensive. On Thursday night, Russian military bloggers erroneously reported that it had already started. Speaking earlier the same day, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his forces needed “some more time”. According to Kostenko, Ukraine’s long-anticipated push should be understood as a rolling “spring-summer campaign” against an entrenched and powerful adversary. Kostenko said the campaign was already unfolding in stages. The first saw the step-by-step elimination of Russia’s military potential, with strikes against logistical targets such as weapons depots and fuel dumps. This has begun, he said. A second stage involved seeking out and eliminating Russian command and control centres, causing a breakdown of communications with troops in the field. “That’s already happening too, probably,” he said. Ukraine’s armed forces were unlikely to embark on a major frontal offensive until they had weakened Moscow’s battlefield capability, he indicated. “Our army won’t go forward until this preparation work is done. We can’t win if they have large amounts of ammunition and resources,” he said. He acknowledged that Ukraine was playing a disinformation game about when and where it might strike, with signs that it was working, and that Moscow was beginning to panic. Germany aims to buy 18 Leopard 2 tanks for €525m (£457m) to replace tanks delivered to Ukraine, a defence source told Reuters on Friday. The total price including an option for another 105 tanks will be €2.9bn (£2.5bn) and the German parliament’s budget committee is expected to sign off on the deal at the end of May, the source said. Germany has supplied 18 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year and has said it intends to plug the gap with new tanks as soon as possible. The Leopard is jointly manufactured by KMW and Rheinmetall. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is “disappointed” in the decision of the European Broadcasting Union, Downing Street has said, after it was reported that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was blocked from addressing Eurovision. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: The prime minister believes it would be fitting for President Zelenskiy to address the event and we’re disappointed by the decision from the European Broadcasting Union. The values and freedoms that President Zelenskiy and the people of Ukraine are fighting for are not political, they’re fundamental, and Eurovision themselves recognised that last year when they rightly suspended Russia’s participation from the competition. There are no plans to intervene and ask broadcasters to change their mind, Downing Street suggested. The Kremlin said on Friday that a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and the Chinese special envoy Li Hui, who is to tour European countries next week to discuss Ukraine, had not yet been set up. “There is no such meeting in the schedule yet. This will all be worked out through diplomatic channels,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday that Ukrainian forces carried out “offensive operations” on Thursday along the entire line of contact near Soledar, the ministry’s official Zvezda news outlet reported. More than a thousand troops and up to 40 tanks were used in the assault, it said, adding that the attacks were “repulsed”. The Kremlin said on Friday that there was nothing new to report after talks on possible renewal of the Black Sea grain deal in Istanbul, and that a potential conversation between the leaders of Turkey and Russia would not help clinch an agreement, Reuters reports. In one of his regular calls with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that only full implementation of the deal would facilitate its renewal. Russia has repeatedly insisted that western sanctions are impeding its export of agricultural products, and that it is unwilling to extend the deal to allow Ukraine to export grain unless this changes. It cites the disconnection of the Russian Agricultural Bank from the Swift payment system and difficulties in being able to insure export vessels as being among factors that need to be addressed. Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said earlier on Friday that parties to the Black Sea grain pact were nearing a deal to extend it. Russia’s defence ministry has denied reports that Ukrainian forces had broken through in various places along the frontlines and said the military situation was under control. Moscow was reacting after Russian military bloggers, writing on the Telegram messaging app, reported apparent Ukrainian advances north and south of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, with some suggesting a long-awaited counteroffensive by pro-Kyiv forces had started. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had earlier said the offensive had yet to start. Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, has said that parties to the Black Sea grain initiative are approaching an extension. Akar’s comment was released by his ministry in a statement on Friday, after talks in Istanbul. Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Musiyenko says Kyiv’s backers understand that a counteroffensive “may not result in the complete eviction of Russian troops and the definitive defeat of Russia in all occupied areas”. “We have to be ready for the war to continue into next year - or it could end this year,” Musiyenko told Ukrainian NV Radio. “It all depends on how the battles develop. We can’t guarantee how the counter-offensive will develop.” The Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Donetsk has reported on Telegram that one person was killed by Ukrainian shelling of the city overnight. The commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has said its defences are being tightened amid a flurry of Ukrainian drone strikes targeting its home base, the Crimean port of Sevastopol. V-Adm Viktor Sokolov told Friday’s edition of the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda: “In connection with the threat of attacks by robotic surface and underwater systems, we have increased the technical defences of the fleet’s main base and of the ships’ anchorages”. Sokolov said the Black Sea Fleet, whose flagship, the cruiser Moskva, was sunk by Ukraine in April 2022, would receive four new ships in 2023. China’s foreign ministry has announced that its special representative of Eurasian affairs will visit Ukraine, Poland, France, Germany and Russia from Monday in what it calls “an effort to promote peace talks”, US President Joe Biden and Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez will discuss Ukraine, defence cooperation, and migration on Friday during a meeting at the White House. While Madrid agrees with Washington on the illegality of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Sánchez will convey the divergent views of China and Brazil and propose giving greater weight to the views of non-Nato nations hurt by the war, a Spanish diplomatic source told Reuters. US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen met German finance minister Christian Lindner on Friday, to underscore the importance of working together to counter evasion of sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine, the US Treasury has said. The prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said on Friday they are considering speeding up a plan to disconnect the Baltic region’s electricity supply from Russia’s power grid. South Africa did not approve any arms shipment to Russia, the minister who chairs the country’s national conventional arms control committee, Mondli Gungubele, told local radio station 702 on Friday, Reuters reports. The United States envoy to South Africa said on Thursday he was confident that a Russian ship had picked up weapons in South Africa last year, in a possible breach of Pretoria’s declared neutrality in the Ukraine conflict. The ambassador’s assertion saw the rand and South African government bonds sell-off, as currency traders said they were worried that South Africa could now face western sanctions. The South African president Cyril Ramaphosa’s office said on Thursday that his government would open an inquiry led by a retired judge into the allegation that arms had been shipped to Russia. The prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said on Friday they are considering speeding up a plan to disconnect the Baltic region’s electricity supply from Russia’s power grid. “Today we agreed to continue discussions on accelerating as soon as all of our studies are finished,” Reuters reports Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas told a joint news conference with her Latvian and Lithuanian counterparts. “Technical studies, especially on production capacity and energy crisis, will allow us to clarify the details and exact timing of this process,” she added. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, will discuss Ukraine, defence cooperation, and migration on Friday during a meeting at the White House. While Madrid agrees with Washington on the illegality of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Sánchez will convey the divergent views of China and Brazil and propose giving greater weight to the views of non-Nato nations hurt by the war, a Spanish diplomatic source told Reuters. There isn’t often a huge amount of news available from the occupied areas of Ukraine, but a Reuters reporter has been allowed to speak to people at a temporary accommodation facility in the occupied port city of Berdiansk in Zaporizhzhia region, one of the areas of Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed acting governor of occupied Zaporizhzhia has said that the temporary relocation of people – prioritising families with children – was due to increased Ukrainian shelling of 18 settlements near the frontline. The claim has not been independently verified. Three evacuees interviewed by Reuters said they had chosen to be evacuated themselves for security reasons. Two expressed satisfaction with their new conditions. All said they hoped to one day return home. Lyudmila, 22, who said she chose to be evacuated from her home in the town of Kamianka-Dniprovska, said the situation there had sometimes been “difficult” and that shells had landed nearby. “We used to go out and watch. Especially at night, you could see the flashes as they launch. We’ve had shells land nearby and when it landed the entire sky was red,” she said. “People get used to it fast, children get used to it. They stop being afraid.” She said she thought people still remaining in her town were “sitting on suitcases” ready to leave if the situation there became more dangerous. She said she was hoping for peace and that the two sides could find common ground. Holding his family’s small dog in his arms as he spoke, a man who gave his name as Artyom said he chose to be evacuated from the town of Tokmak with his wife and children as a precaution. “We are sure that everything will be fine, but we don’t want to take any risks. When the opportunity arose, we left,” he said. Alyona Trokai, a representative for the Russian Movement for Children and Youth, which is working to help settle the evacuees, said around 2,000 people had arrived at the centre so far. Ukraine has repeatedly complained about Russian authorities relocating Ukrainian citizens. The commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has said its defences are being tightened amid a flurry of Ukrainian drone strikes targeting its home base, the Crimean port of Sevastopol, an area that the Russian Federation claimed to annex from Ukraine in 2014. Reuters reports V-Adm Viktor Sokolov told Friday’s edition of the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda: “In connection with the threat of attacks by robotic surface and underwater systems, we have increased the technical defences of the fleet’s main base and of the ships’ anchorages.” Sokolov said the Black Sea Fleet, whose flagship, the cruiser Moskva, was sunk by Ukraine in April 2022, would receive four new ships in 2023. Sevastopol has repeatedly been attacked with drones since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, met the German finance minister, Christian Lindner, on Friday, to underscore the importance of working together to counter evasion of sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine, the US Treasury has said. “Secretary Yellen expressed appreciation for Germany’s close coordination on the implementation of Russia sanctions and discussed the importance of aligning efforts to counter sanctions evasion,” Reuters reports it said in a statement. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that overnight there have been three explosions recorded in Sumy oblast. No casualties are known. China’s foreign ministry has announced that its special representative of Eurasian affairs will visit Ukraine, Poland, France, Germany and Russia from Monday in what it calls “an effort to promote peace talks”, Reuters reports. Xi Jinping, China’s president, had pledged in a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart last month that he would send a delegation to the region to help facilitate peace talks. It was the first time the two presidents had spoken since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. In April, a report on Chinese state TV said Xi had told Zelenskiy during their call: “Negotiation is the only viable way out.” Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has issued a combative statement in response to Uzbek and Azerbaijani news websites publishing an article by Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the president of Ukraine. In the course of it, she says: This libeler (he cannot be called anything else) is unable to accept this inconvenient truth: Russia is a friend and defender of anyone who is interested in its friendship and defence, anyone who does not act antagonistically at its doorstep, or attack its citizens, compatriots, culture or history. There are simply no examples to the contrary. The fact that our allies are providing platforms for a high-ranking representative of the Nazi authorities in Ukraine to distort the essence of our relations is certainly baffling. We know that the collective west, not hiding its intentions to inflict damage on Russia, would use anyone, including the post-Soviet countries – not actually considering them valuable partners, but springboards for attacks on our country that still have untapped potential as such. But it is precisely the Nazi essence of the current government in Kyiv, sponsored by the west, that has undermined the foundations of European security. We respect the freedom of the press. However, it is our belief that the information landscape in countries friendly to us cannot be a platform for broadcasting intentionally false and provocative fabrications. Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and during the course of what it terms its “special military operation” it has passed new laws restricting criticism of the war, and jailed journalists. Reuters has a quick snap that Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, has said that parties to the Black Sea grain initiative are approaching an extension. Reuters reports Akar’s comment was released by his ministry in a statement on Friday, after talks in Istanbul. The Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Donetsk has reported on Telegram that one person was killed by Ukrainian shelling of the city overnight. Alexei Kulemzin posted “As a result of the shelling of the Kyivskyi district of Donetsk region, a man of 40-50 years old was killed.” My colleague Archie Bland looks at what a Ukrainian counter-offensive might mean in practice in today’s First Edition newsletter: Ukraine’s greatest success of the war so far came when it successfully fooled Moscow into thinking its September attack would come in the south, and not in the northern Kharkiv region. Surprises over timing and location are the most powerful tool at Ukraine’s disposal as it attempts to regain lost territory, break Russian supply lines, and bolster western support for the long war that likely lies ahead. But it is also extremely difficult to maintain. After the stalemate of winter, Ukraine has talked openly about a planned counteroffensive for months. “We are preparing for it,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in April. “It will happen.” But yesterday, he suggested that despite endless speculation about the timing, his country’s forces were not yet ready. Ukrainian commanders have also said that Kyiv lacks vital weapons for the new push – but there are also reasons to be sceptical. The Economist’s defence editor Shashank Joshi wrote on Twitter that “Of course this is what you’d say if the counter-offensive was about to begin,” appending a shrug emoji. And it is always useful for Ukraine to increase pressure for more western military hardware. “Secrecy is very, very important,” the Guardian’s defence editor Dan Sabbagh said. “It’s essential to the success of what happens next. In Russian, it’s called ‘maskirova’ – the military concept of operational security and secrecy, but also active deception about what to expect. So we don’t know exactly what’s going to happen or when.” With a 900-mile frontline that divides occupied eastern territory roughly the size of Portugal from the rest of Ukraine, there are no shortage of possible sites for the attack. But there is a relatively brief list of options both viable enough and valuable enough to be plausible. “The ‘route one’ option, and the most obvious strategic imperative, is to cut the “land bridge” to Crimea,” Dan said. That would severely hamper supply lines to Russian troops in the rest of Ukraine as well as being a humiliating blow for Putin. “But the obvious counterpoint to that is that the geography is perfectly obvious to the Russians as well. They have been preparing for a possible attack and they are very well dug in.” There are other options available. “They could also try to attack Crimea by crossing the Dnieper River further west,” Dan said. “But the Dnieper is a formidable, wide river that has already hurt the Russians when they were forced to give up Kherson.” Also possible is a counterattack in Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia has the upper hand after long and bitter fighting – but Ukraine made its first significant gains in months this week. Finally, the Ukrainians could seek a breakthrough in the northern province of Luhansk – more sparsely defended, and providing a route to Russian-held cities in the Donbas. But there is less obvious strategic value in that territory. “And it’s quite close to Russia proper, so it would be easier to bring in reinforcements,” Dan added.

Ukraine’s defence ministry has issued some statistics about air attacks on Kyiv. The Ukrainian capital has faced 851 hours and 38 minutes of air alarms (the equivalent of just over 35 days) since 24 February 2022, the ministry said. It also states that “not a single missile or drone has reached its target” for over two months now thanks to air defence efforts. Rodion Miroshnik, formerly the self-styled ambassador to Russia of the Luhansk People’s Republic, has posted on Telegram that “the situation on the frontline in the north-west of the LPR has not changed significantly”. Tass quotes the Russian-imposed official as saying: “According to intelligence and satellite surveillance, there are attempts to concentrate [Ukrainian] armoured forces in the Krasnyi Lyman and Kupiansk directions. But so far they are at a distance from the zone adjacent to the line of contact.” The claims have not been independently verified. Luhansk is one of four partly occupied regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. According to Reuters, Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Musiyenko says Kyiv’s backers understand that a counteroffensive “may not result in the complete eviction of Russian troops and the definitive defeat of Russia in all occupied areas.” “We have to be ready for the war to continue into next year - or it could end this year,” Musiyenko told Ukrainian NV Radio. “It all depends on how the battles develop. We can’t guarantee how the counter-offensive will develop.” Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner private army which has led the fight in Bakhmut, on Thursday said Ukrainian operations were “unfortunately, partially successful”. He called Zelenskiy’s assertion that the counteroffensive had not yet begun “deceptive”. A strong explosion was heard in Melitopol in Zaporizhzhia a short whole ago, according to exiled mayor Ivan Fedorov. Zaporizhzhia is under Russian occupation. “A strong single explosion in Melitopol. Resounded in the very centre of the city,” Federov wrote on Telegram. He did not provide further details. In case you missed this yesterday: Britain has become the first western country to provide Ukraine with the long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles that Kyiv wants to boost its chances in a much-anticipated counteroffensive, prompting a threat from the Kremlin of a military response, the Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh and Luke Harding report. Hours after Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he needed more western weapons to be confident of a victory this summer, Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, told MPs that the missiles – which cost more than £2m each – were “now going in, or are in the country itself”. The gift of the missiles was supported by the US, Wallace added, although previously Washington had declined to give Ukraine long-range missiles of its own, fearing that the outcome could escalate hostilities in the 15-month war. “The use of Storm Shadow will allow Ukraine to push back Russian forces based within Ukrainian sovereign territory,” Wallace told MPs, adding: “Russia must recognise that their actions alone have led to such systems being provided.” Unnamed Kremlin sources say recent statements by Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin is “seriously disturbing the top leadership” in the Kremlin, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest update on the conflict. Citing a report by Russian opposition outlet Meduza, the US thinktank noted that the sources said “Prigozhin may have crossed the Kremlin’s “red lines” and may alienate his supporters within the Russian inner circle”. Russia’s defence ministry has denied reports that Ukrainian forces had broken through in various places along the front lines and said the military situation was under control, according to Reuters. Moscow was reacting after Russian military bloggers, writing on the Telegram messaging app, reported what they said were Ukrainian advances north and south of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, with some suggesting a long-awaited counteroffensive by pro-Kyiv forces had started. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had earlier said the offensive had yet to start. “Statements circulated by individual Telegram channels about ‘defence breakthroughs’ that took place in different areas along the line of military contact do not correspond to reality,” the Russian defence ministry said in a Telegram post. “The overall situation in the area of the special military operation is under control,” it said in a statement, using the Kremlin’s description of the war in Ukraine. The fact the Russian ministry felt obliged to release the statement reflects what Moscow acknowledges is a “very difficult” military operation. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Out top story this morning: Moscow has rejected reports by Russian military bloggers and Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin that Ukrainian forces have broken through Russian frontlines in the devastated city of Bakhmut. “Statements circulated by individual Telegram channels about ‘defence breakthroughs’ that took place in different areas along the line of military contact do not correspond to reality,” the Russian defence ministry said in a Telegram post. “The overall situation in the area of the special military operation is under control,” it said in a statement, using the Kremlin’s description of the war in Ukraine. Elsewhere: Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed reports that the UK is donating long-range Storm Shadow missiles to Ukraine. Wallace said Ukrainians will have the “best chance to defend themselves”. The US ambassador to South Africa has accused the country of covertly providing arms to Russia – a charge that drew an angry rebuke from Pretoria. Reuben Brigety told a media briefing that the US believed weapons and ammunition had been loaded on to a Russian freighter that docked at a Cape Town naval base in December. “We are confident that weapons were loaded on to that vessel and I would bet my life on the accuracy of that assertion,” Brigety said, according to a video of the remarks. “The arming of Russia by South Africa … is fundamentally unacceptable.” A Ukrainian brigade commander fighting in the ruins of Bakhmut said Russian mercenary forces have stepped up shelling and artillery attacks in recent days and were not facing a munitions shortage, despite its chief’s claims to the contrary. Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Thursday that the situation on the flanks near the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut was unfolding in line with the “worst of all expected scenarios”. Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, confirmed that the army was aware of a possible missile heading towards the country in December but failed to inform the government. Poland has been on alert for possible spillover of weaponry from the war in neighbouring Ukraine, especially since two people were killed near the border last November by what Warsaw concluded was a misfired Ukrainian air defence missile. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the country needs more time to prepare for a much-anticipated spring counteroffensive, saying: “We can go forward and be successful. But we’d lose a lot of people. I think that’s unacceptable. So we need to wait. We still need a bit more time.” Zelenskiy again denied any Ukrainian responsibility for the drone incident over the Kremlin. Russia has accused Washington and Kyiv of masterminding the attack, which it described as an assassination attempt on Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Putin was not in the Kremlin at the time, and no injuries were caused by the drones. A Ukrainian drone attacked an oil storage depot in the Russian border region of Bryansk, the local governor has claimed in a post on his Telegram channel on Thursday. There were no casualties after the attack on the facility near the town of Klintsy, owned by Russia’s Rosneft oil company, though one storage tank was partly damaged, the governor, Alexander Bogomaz, said. Belgorod’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, claimed that seven settlements in the Russian region have been left without electricity after Ukrainian shelling over the border."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/13/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-region-hit-by-drone-strikes-putin-to-meet-turkish-president-erdogan-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T17:53:49Z","webTitle":"Russian forces will be ‘annihilated’ if Putin uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine, says senior EU official – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/13/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-region-hit-by-drone-strikes-putin-to-meet-turkish-president-erdogan-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/13/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-region-hit-by-drone-strikes-putin-to-meet-turkish-president-erdogan-live","fields":{"headline":"Russian forces will be ‘annihilated’ if Putin uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine, says senior EU official – as it happened","bodyText":"It is coming up to 9pm in Kyiv. That’s it from me, Joe Middleton, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog for today. Here is a round-up of everything you might have missed: The EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow that its forces would be “annihilated” by the west’s military response if president Vladimir Putin used nuclear weapons against Ukraine, AFP reports. At the opening of the Diplomacy Academy in Brussels, Borrell said: “Any nuclear attack against Ukraine will create an answer, not a nuclear answer but such a powerful answer from the military side that the Russian army will be annihilated.” The Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg, also said Russia faced “severe consequences” if it launched a nuclear assault on Ukraine. After retreating about 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely to be attempting to consolidate a new frontline west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end, where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Volodymyr Saldo, has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people. Just hours later Russia confirmed it would evacuate residents from Kherson. The Russian deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin said on state television: “The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country. We will provide everyone with free accommodation and everything necessary.” Ukraine’s state emergency service said a 12-year-old boy had been rescued after hours under rubble, after rockets hit a five-story residential building in Mykolaiv. Ukraine’s power grid has been “stabilised” after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said Thursday. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit Thursday in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” the foreign ministry said. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting on Thursday, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. The UN general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told Russian television Thursday that the vote was anti-Russian and that the west had used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries in order to force them to vote. He dismissed US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine currently had only 10% of what it needed in terms of air defences. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said that Russia would run out of supplies and armaments before the west did. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west that would ensure that the international community could continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Daniel Boffey reports for us from Kyiv: Moscow has announced it will evacuate Kherson after an appeal from the Russian-installed head of the region, raising fears the occupied city at the heart of the south Ukrainian oblast will become a new frontline. Marat Khusnullin, a Russian deputy prime minister, told state television on Thursday that residents would be helped to move away from the region in south Ukraine, which remains only partly occupied by invading troops due to a successful Ukrainian counterattack in recent months. “The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country,” Khusnullin said. The development followed a public request on the social media platform Telegram by Volodymyr Saldo, a former mayor of the port city, who was installed in April by the Russian forces as head of the wider Kherson region. Read more: Russia announces Kherson evacuation, raising fears city will become frontline Simon Smith is chair of the steering committee of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House, and they write for us to argue that Putin’s latest campaign stems from desperation: The Russian missile strikes on Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine over the past two days have opened a further deplorable chapter in Russia’s aggression against the country. Yet we need to resist seeing it as a shocking new moment in Russia’s assault. Each additional death brings new personal tragedy and heartbreak. But, in many respects, the wrecking of civilian lives and infrastructure is not new. It’s what millions of Ukrainians have been bravely living with for months. These strikes – and those that may well follow – are more of the same: entirely in line with the vindictiveness and indifference to civilian suffering with which Ukrainians have become familiar over eight years under Russian attack.

As we reported earlier, Ukraine and Russia said 20 soldiers on both sides had been released as part of a prisoner exchange, 40 soldiers in all. In a follow-up post, Yermak said that 14 of the returned soldiers were from the Ukrainian armed forces, four were from the territorial defence forces, one from the national guard and one from the navy. Russia said today it will evacuate residents from the occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson after a plea from a Kremlin-backed official, AFP reports. The Russian deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin said on state television: The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country. We will provide everyone with free accommodation and everything necessary. As we reported earlier Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the Kherson administration, posted a video on Telegram urging people to leave the region due to missile attacks. He directly addressed Russian authorities and asked them to “help organise this work.” The plea is a possible sign that Ukraine’s counteroffensive is continuing to make inroads in the south of the country. It comes just a day after Kyiv said it had retaken five settlements in Kherson. Kherson is one of the four regions in Ukraine that Moscow recently claimed to have annexed. Young Ukrainians from Kyiv are organising “repair together” weekends to help villages devastated by Russian occupation by cleaning up and rebuilding homes for free. Tetiana Burianova was traveling in Peru when the war broke out and rushed back to Ukraine to help out in any way she could. With her friends, she began collecting donations and organising repair events that now attract hundreds of young people from cities each weekend. The Guardian’s Christopher Cherry reports from a liberated village where he meets locals finding it impossible to forgive a brutal occupation, and volunteers determined to build a better Ukraine amid the ruin. Maksym Kozytsky, the head of the regional military administration in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, said today that Russia launched six rockets in the region. He said that Ukraine’s air defence forces shot down four of them, but two of the rockets hit a target. Kozytsky did not specify what was struck by the bombardment or if there were any casualties. In a post on his Twitter and Telegram accounts, he said: Today, the enemy launched 6 rockets on the territory of Lviv region. Unfortunately, there are two hits. Four rockets were shot down by soldiers of the “Zahid” PvK. Thanks to our air defence for the highly professional work. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow today that its forces would be “annihilated” by the west’s military response if president Vladimir Putin uses nuclear weapons against Ukraine, AFP reports. At the opening of the Diplomacy Academy in Brussels, Borrell said: Putin is saying he is not bluffing. Well, he cannot afford bluffing, and it has to be clear that the people supporting Ukraine and the European Union and the member states, and the United States and Nato are not bluffing neither. Any nuclear attack against Ukraine will create an answer, not a nuclear answer but such a powerful answer from the military side that the Russian Army will be annihilated. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg also said Russia faces “severe consequences” if it launches a nuclear assault on Ukraine. However the alliance has stopped short of threatening to use its nuclear arsenal to respond as non-member Ukraine is not covered by its self-defence clause. After retreating around 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely attempting to consolidate a new front line west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people. Ukraine’s state emergency service said a 12-year-old boy has been rescued after hours under rubble after rockets hit a five-story residential building in Mykolaiv. Ukraine‘s power grid has been “stabilised” after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said Thursday. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit Thursday in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” the foreign ministry said. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting on Thursday, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. The United Nations general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told Russian television Thursday that the vote was anti-Russian and that the west had used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries in order to force them to vote. He dismissed US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine currently only has 10% of what it needs in terms of air defences. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said that Russia will run out of supplies and armaments before the west does. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west that will ensure that the international community will be able to continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Ukraine and Russia say 20 soldiers on both sides have been released as part of a prisoner exchange, 40 soldiers in all, Associated Press reports. The Russian defence ministry said: As a result of the negotiation process on the exchange today, 20 Russian servicemen were returned from the territory of Ukraine controlled by the Kyiv regime. Ukraine also said its 20 soldiers have been freed from captivity in Olenivka, in the occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. They are now undergoing medical checkups. The head of the Ukrainian president’s office, Andriy Yermak, vowed on Telegram: We will bring everyone back. Philip Oltermann reports for us in Berlin: Europe’s largest economy is still a “teenager” when it comes to foreign security policy, the German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s chief of staff has said, asking for patience from western allies urging Germany to take a more proactive leadership in its support of Ukraine. “We are getting into a situation that Americans have known for decades: people want us to lead,” said Wolfgang Schmidt, a longstanding ally of Scholz who also serves as the political point of contact for the country’s intelligence agencies. “We are in the teenager years in that role,” he said, responding to criticism that Berlin has been slow to live up to the Zeitenwende or “epochal turn” on military and foreign policy Scholz had declared in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Read more: Germany still a ‘teenager’ on leading foreign security policy, says Scholz’s top aide These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. Earlier we reported that Moscow had summoned the ambassadors from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Russia and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures on the Nord Stream gas pipelines [see 10.52am]. The Reuters news agency is now carrying a statement from the Danish foreign ministry which says “the Russian wish to participate in the investigation of the Nord Stream leaks has been brought up through diplomatic channels in Moscow and Copenhagen.” However, Sweden’s foreign ministry appears to have told the media that it has not received any summons. At the same time, the Russian president’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said, according to reports from Russian agency Interfax, that arrests have been made after an attempt to attack the TurkStream pipeline: Some forces, Putin gave hints about the possible origin of these forces, they encroached on the TurkStream as well. Saboteurs were taken, several people were arrested. They wanted to blow it up. On our territory, on land. The TurkStream pipeline runs from near Anapa in Krasnodar Krai to Kıyıköy in north-western Turkey. Interfax reports that earlier in October, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said that Ukrainian authorities were trying to undermine a section of the pipeline. Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, has posted images of a visit to the city by Harjit Sajjan, who is Canada’s minister for international development. Lviv was one of the cities whose electrical infrastructure was attacked by Russia earlier in the week. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people, Agence France-Presse reports. In a video posted to Telegram, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the Kherson administration, said: We suggested to all people of the Kherson region to, if they wish, leave to other regions to protect themselves from missile hits. In addressing the leadership of the country [Russia], I ask you to help organise this work. He added: We, the people of the Kherson region, know that Russia does not abandon its own. Saldo said the region was being hit by an increasing amount of rocket attacks bringing “serious damage”, in signs that Ukraine’s counteroffensive was continuing to made progress. His warning comes just a day after Kyiv said it had retaken five settlements in the Kherson region. Kherson is one of the four regions in Ukraine that Moscow recently claimed to have annexed. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting today, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. “The topic of a Russian-Ukrainian settlement was not discussed,” RIA cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit today in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. Agence France-Presse reports that the Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement on Telegram: The Ukrainian armed forces shelled Belgorod. There is damage at a residential apartment building on Gubkin street. Information about the victims is being detailed. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”. Gladkov added that shelling by Ukraine’s forces had landed near school grounds in a village called Krasnoye outside the main city of Belgorod, with students learning online from home. No one was reported injured or killed. Attending a Nato meeting, the UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said there was no risk that western allies would run out of arms supplies to aid Ukraine against Russia. “The UK-Danish joint-led international fund is all about placing orders in a manufacturing space to make sure that we can go on between 2023, 24, and keep going on,” Wallace said today. He added that the UK would provide Ukraine with air defence systems that would complement US-provided systems. Ukraine faced a barrage of missile strikes earlier this week, damaging civilian infrastructure and knocking out electricity supplies in some cities AFP reports that Ukraine‘s power grid has been “stabilised” after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said today. The head of Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, said on Facebook: The introduction of scheduled emergency blackouts is currently not being planned ... This became possible, first of all, thanks to the fact that Ukrenergo and Oblenergo experts stabilised the energy supply in all regions of Ukraine. We withstood what was probably the largest missile attack on energy infrastructure in history. Whether there will be [supply] restrictions in the future depends primarily on whether there will be new shelling and destruction. Russia has blitzed Ukraine with missiles this week, in attacks that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said were retaliation for a deadly explosion at a Crimea bridge. As we previously reported, Ukrainian officials said that 40 towns and cities in the country had been targeted by Russian forces in the past 24 hours. As well as Putin’s idea for a gas hub, detailed in the post below this one, the Russian president and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, also discussed nuclear power. Meeting Putin at the start of a regional summit in Kazakhstan, Erdoğan mentioned Russia’s construction of Turkey’s first nuclear power plant, which Ankara hopes to open next year, AFP reports. Erdoğan raised the idea of Russia building a second nuclear power plant in northern Turkey. The Turkish president also defended Ankara’s booming trade ties with Moscow. The US and the EU are piling pressure on Turkey to comply with sanctions they imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. But Erdoğan has refused, offering the Nato member Turkey as a neutral venue for possible truce talks, and approving a range of agreements that have seen the value of exports to Russia more than double in recent months. Russian president Vladimir Putin floated the idea of a major gas hub in Turkey during talks with his counterpart Recep Tayip Erdoğan today. Putin told Erdoğan at a meeting in Kazakhstan: Turkey has turned out to be the most reliable route for deliveries today, even to Europe. We could consider the possibility of creating a gas hub in Turkey for supplies to other countries. The Russian president added: In the course of the work of this hub, which we could create together, of course, it would also be a platform not only for supplies, but also for determining the price, because this is a very important issue - the issue of pricing. Today, these prices are sky-high; we could easily regulate at a normal market level, without any political overtones. Putin suggested on Wednesday that Russia could create a major gas hub in Turkey by redirecting supplies intended for the damaged Nord Stream undersea pipelines, reports Reuters. Swedish and Danish authorities are investigating the blasts as acts of sabotage but have not yet said who they believe was responsible. In the televised exchange between the two leaders, Erdoğan did not comment on the gas hub idea. This graphic shows the location of the Russian missiles that struck 40 Ukrainian towns and cities today, according to officials. Ukraine‘s Armed Forces General Staff said that in the past 24 hours more than 40 settlements were hit by Russian shelling. In response Ukraine‘s air force carried out 32 strikes on 25 Russian targets. The mayor of the port city of Mykolaiv, Oleksandr Senkevich, said in a social media post that the southern city was “massively shelled”, reports Reuters.

Estonia has confirmed a new military aid package for Ukraine that will include winter gear, equipment and ammunition. Prime minister Kaja Kallas confirmed the additional support in a tweet today. Kallas added: Let us all speed up our help, so Ukrainians can free their territories. This is the way to peace. Estonia, who share a border with Russia, have already provided Kyiv with more than €220 million (£192,479,486) in military assistance and have called for richer Western nations to increase weapons supplies to the country. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, have started talks in Astana, Kazakhstan. The duo are in the country for the the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia. The meeting is taking place on the sidelines of the regional summit, and the Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov previously suggested the Erdoğan could propose ideas for peace. Philip Oltermann reports for us from Berlin: The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has accused Vladimir Putin of waging “a crusade against our way of life”, in a shift of rhetoric days after heavy Russian missile strikes hit major Ukrainian cities. “They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade,” Scholz said in a video address to a summit of European socialist, liberal and green politicians and thinkers in Berlin. “A crusade against liberal democracy, a crusade against the rules-based international order, a crusade against freedom and progress, a crusade against our way of life,” he added. Read more: Putin’s war on Ukraine part of crusade against liberal democracy, says Scholz Ukraine’s state emergency service has said it is actively searching for people trapped under rubble after a Russian strike on Mykolaiv. In a statement on Thursday, it said: “Rockets hit a five-storey residential building. As a result, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest – under rubble.” A 12-year-old boy has been rescued from the site but there are thought to be at least seven others trapped. After retreating around 20km to the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely to be attempting to consolidate a new frontline west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence.

The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Tass, the Russian state news agency, in an interview on Thursday. Turkey’s aim is to stop the bloodshed in the Russia-Ukraine war as soon as possible despite hurdles, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told a regional summit in Kazakhstan. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Thursday the war in Ukraine was part of a broader movement against the west by Russia. He said: “Vladimir Putin and his enablers have made one thing very clear: this war is not only about Ukraine. They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade, a crusade against liberal democracy.” The Russian state-owned Tass news agency is reporting that officials at Russia’s nuclear power station operator Rosenergoatom have begun the process of transitioning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) to Russian processes, in particular “the storage system for spent fuel of the Russian Federation”. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Joe Middleton will be here shortly. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” Reuters reports the foreign ministry said. European nations have suggested the only possible cause of the ruptures to the pipelines was sabotage, with only a limited number of state actors suspected of being capable of such an operation. Two quotes this morning underscore the diplomatic gulf between the rhetoric of western leaders and Russia. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has this morning said the war in Ukraine is part of a broader movement against the west by Russia. Reuters quotes him saying: “Vladimir Putin and his enablers have made one thing very clear: this war is not only about Ukraine. They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade, a crusade against liberal democracy.” Meanwhile, Tass news agency is reporting the words of Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. He has told Russian television that the west used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries so an anti-Russian resolution on “referendums” in the occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions was adopted at the session of the UN general assembly. Tass report Lavrov also said that US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote were false. Here is the clip of the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, explaining that procurement processes are in place among allies in the west that he says will ensure that the international community will be able to continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has issued its latest situation map of how it sees developments on the ground in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine has only 10% of what it needs in terms of air defences. The president was speaking in a question and answer session with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Reuters has reported. Zelenskiy also said diplomacy was not possible with leaders who did not respect international law. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, has posted to Telegram to report that the city of Orikhiv has been targeted, killing one person. He writes: The city of Orikhiv is once again the target of the enemy. The occupier destroyed residential buildings along the central street and in a residential neighbourhood with a massive, multi-hour shelling of a small, peaceful town. The enemy took the life of a resident of the village. In addition, we have 9 wounded from Orikhov and 1 from Preobrazhenka, 3 more in Stepnohirsk. Other objects of civil infrastructure and utility networks, homes in which people invested their whole lives were destroyed. We will rebuild everything as soon as we knock out the enemy from our land, but the main thing is to save human life. Zaporizhzhia is one of the four occupied regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex, despite not being fully in control of the territory. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said there “isn’t a risk” of the western supply of arms to Ukraine running out before Russia’s supplies are exhausted. He told Deborah Haynes, the defence and security correspondent of Sky News: There isn’t a risk because unlike Russia, who has already isolated itself and we saw that yesterday at the United Nations vote, they need a supply chain. Large parts of the supply chain were not in Russia. They came from all over the world, including in Europe, including indeed even in Ukraine, some of their supply chain was in Ukraine. We have the ability to refurbish or indeed manufacture a new supply chain which is what we are doing right now. The UK-Danish joint-led international fund is all about placing orders in a manufacturing space to make sure we can go on in 2023, 2024 and keep going on. The state emergency service of Ukraine has issued this image of the target of a strike in Mykolaiv. In the UK, the foreign secretary James Cleverly has been doing the morning media round. So far his interviews have entirely been dominated by domestic issues. However, on Sky News he did mention the vote in the UN, telling viewers that domestic problems were being “amplified by Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine.” He went on to say: We need to help Ukrainians defend their country. We saw in the vote in the United Nations last night, we’ve got an international coalition of condemnation against Russia in support of Ukraine. The Russian state-owned Tass news agency is reporting that officials at Russia’s nuclear power station operator Rosenergoatom have begun the process of transitioning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) to Russian processes, in particular “the storage system for spent fuel of the Russian Federation”. It quotes Renat Karchaa, adviser to the general director of Rosenergoatom, saying: “The process of switching to the Russian system has already been launched.” He added: “This implies a number of points, starting with documents, regulations and so on. It is clear that there will be a transitional period for each component. “While we are immersing ourselves in the process, we are simultaneously analysing all the processes and developing specific solutions, including those related to the storage of all nuclear materials.” Yesterday, Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, described the situation at the ZNPP as “deeply worrying” after the plant again lost external power due to Russian military action cutting supplies. Energoatom, the Ukrainian operator of the plant, also accused the Russian forces occupying it of blocking attempts to refuel the site’s diesel generators. The governor of Lviv, Maksym Kozytskyi, has said that “the day in our region passed without worries” in his latest update. He stated that 301 people arrived in the region on evacuation trains from the east of Ukraine, and that 547 travelled from Lviv oblast to Przemyśl in Poland on evacuation trains. Rodion Miroshnik, the self-styled ambassador to Russia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), has criticised the vote at the UN, saying developing nations had been forced to vote “at the point of an American gun”. He posted to Telegram: Yesterday’s vote at the special session of the UN General Assembly is a demonstration of the US’s ability to put pressure on and twist the arms of developing countries. The “scoreboard” only demonstrates who is not yet ready to resist American blackmail, and who they have not found leverage against. It has nothing to do with the true will of states and their peoples. But even with such a vote “at the point of an American gun,” countries with a population of half the world either voted against or abstained from voting for the American-Albanian resolution condemning Russia’s actions to recognise referendums in the LPR, Donetsk People’s Republic, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. The Russian Federation has announced that the occupied Ukrainian region of Luhansk is to be annexed, after staging widely-derided “referendums” in four regions. The LPR is only recognised as a legitimate authority by three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said it is actively searching for people trapped under rubble after a Russian strike on Mykolaiv. In a message on Telegram, the service said: One of the rockets hit a five-story residential building in one of the districts of the city. As a result, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest – under rubble. As of 8am, rescuers unblocked a twelve-year-old boy from under the rubble, who was handed over to doctors. According to preliminary information, there may be seven residents of the five-story building under the ruins of the building, with whom there is currently no communication. Rescuers are searching for them and analysing the destroyed structures. To provide assistance to the local population, volunteers of the Red Cross Society of Ukraine are working on the spot, emergency medical teams, law enforcement officers and emergency teams of the city are involved. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Turkey’s aim is to stop the bloodshed in the Russia-Ukraine war as soon as possible despite hurdles, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told a regional summit in Kazakhstan. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told the Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Tass cited Venediktov as saying: Kyiv is well aware that such a step would mean a guaranteed escalation to a World War Three. Apparently, that’s what they are counting on - to create informational noise and draw attention to themselves once again.” Venediktov also repeated a Russian position that the west, by helping Ukraine, indicated that “they are a direct party to the conflict”. After retreating around 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely attempting to consolidate a new front line west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. “In recent days, the Russian occupation authorities have likely ordered preparation for the evacuation of some civilians from Kherson,” the report adds. “It is likely that they anticipate combat extending to the city of Kherson itself.” Recently released satellite images show a close view of traffic and bridge repair work on the collapsed part of the Kerch bridge in Crimea. The images made available by Maxar Technologies are dated 12 October. An explosion on Saturday partially destroyed the strategic key bridge, built specifically on Putin’s orders and linking Crimea to Russia. Ukraine has not directly claimed responsibility for the attack. Dozens of Ukraine’s allies have pledged to send more military aid to Ukraine after more than 50 western countries met In Brussels on Wednesday. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of the sophisticated national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (Nasams) from the US. “A new era of air defence has begun in Ukraine,” Reznikov tweeted. “Iris-Ts from Germany are already here. Nasams are coming. This is only the beginning. And we need more.” The UK has said it will donate cutting edge air defence weaponry, capable of shooting down cruise missiles It did not say how many of the Amraam rockets would be sent to Ukraine, but said they would be used with Nasams. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said: “Russia’s latest indiscriminate strikes on civilian areas in Ukraine warrant further support to those seeking to defend their nation. So today I have authorised the supply of Amraam anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine. These weapons will help Ukraine defend its skies from attacks and strengthen their overall missile defence alongside the US Nasams.” France has also promised radar and air defence systems in the coming weeks while Canada said it would provide artillery rounds and winter clothing. The Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, wrote in a letter to parliament that her government would be donating €15m (£13m) worth of air defences to Ukraine. US president Joe Biden said the vote sent a “clear message” to Moscow. “The stakes of this conflict are clear to all, and the world has sent a clear message in response – Russia cannot erase a sovereign state from the map,” he said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was “grateful to 143 states that supported the historic UNGA [United Nations general assembly] resolution”, tweeting: “The world had its say – [Russia’s] attempt at annexation is worthless and will never be recognised by free nations.” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said the vote showed international unity against Russia and repeated that Washington would never recognise the “sham” referendums. The vote “is a powerful reminder that the overwhelming majority of nations stand with Ukraine, in defence of the UN Charter and in resolute opposition to Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine and its people,” he said in a statement. Before the vote, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said: “Today it is Russia invading Ukraine. But tomorrow it could be another nation whose territory is violated. It could be you. You could be next. What would you expect from this chamber?” The United Nations general assembly has overwhelmingly condemned Russia’s “attempted illegal annexation” of four Ukrainian regions, demanding that Moscow reverse course. Three-quarters of the 193-member general assembly – or 143 countries – voted on Wednesday in favour of a resolution that called Moscow’s move illegal, deepening Russia’s international isolation. Only four countries joined Russia in voting against the resolution – Syria, Nicaragua, North Korea and Belarus. Thirty-five countries abstained, including Russia’s strategic partner China, together with India, South Africa and Pakistan. The rest did not vote. The resolution adopted on Wednesday declares that Moscow’s actions violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, are “inconsistent” with the principles of the UN charter, and “have no validity under international law and do not form the basis for any alteration of the status of these regions of Ukraine.” It demands that Russia “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.” It also supports “the de-escalation of the current situation and a peaceful resolution of the conflict through political dialogue, negotiation, mediation and other peaceful means” that respect Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and internationally recognised borders. Russian president Vladimir Putin is set to meet his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on the sidelines of a regional summit in Kazakhstan later today. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said the Turkish president may propose ideas for peace, hinting that “a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us” while speaking to reporters on Wednesday. Now many say that the Turks are ready to come up with other initiatives in the context of the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict. There are reports in the press that the Turkish side is putting forward specific considerations in this regard, I do not exclude that Erdogan will actively touch on this topic during the Astana contact. So a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us.” As we await more details on the reported drone strike on Kyiv region this morning, the southern city of Mykolaiv has also reported being hit by a barrage of missiles overnight. “A five-storey residential building was hit, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest – under rubble. Rescuers are working on the site,” mayor Oleksandr Senkevich said in a Telegram post just before 4am local time, adding the southern city was “massively shelled”. After the first night, Mykolaiv was massively shelled. A five-story residential building was hit. The two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest - under rubble. Rescuers are working on the spot.” Russian forces have reportedly struck the Kyiv region with kamikaze drones, according to local officials and media reports. Kyiv regional governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, issued an update via his official Telegram channel just after 6am local time, saying: We have attacks on one of the communities of the region. Previously - an attack of kamikaze drones. Rescuers are already working.” Kuleba urged residents to stay in shelters. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of president Zelenskiy’s office, also reported that critical infrastructure facilities were hit by drone strikes in the region. Another attack by kamikaze drones on critical infrastructure facilities.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next few hours. Russian president Vladimir Putin is set to meet his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on the sidelines of a regional summit in Kazakhstan later today. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said the Turkish president may propose ideas for peace, hinting that “a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us” while speaking to reporters on Wednesday. We are also receiving reports that the Kyiv region has been hit by drone strikes early this morning with Zelenskiy’s office reporting critical infrastructure facilities being struck. Here’s a rundown of all the latest major developments over the past 24 hours. The United Nations general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. A Russian nuclear strike would “almost certainly” trigger a “physical response” from Ukraine’s allies and potentially from Nato, a senior Nato official has said. Any use of nuclear weapons by Moscow would have “unprecedented consequences” for Russia, the official was quoted by Reuters as saying. The US will need to deter two major nuclear weapons powers for the first time, the Biden administration has warned. Washington’s new national security strategy (NSS) depicts China as the most capable long-term competitor, but Russia as the more immediate, disruptive threat, pointing to its nuclear posturing over Ukraine. “Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning,” the strategy blueprint reads. Putin will meet Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in what is likely to be a “very interesting” meeting in Kazakhstan on Thursday, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. Ukraine’s army boasted of territorial gains near the strategically vital southern city of Kherson on Wednesday. Five settlements in the Beryslav district in the north-east of the Kherson region – Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone – were said to have been taken from Russian forces over the day. Nato allies delivered new air defence systems in the wake of Russia’s recent missile attacks across the country. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of sophisticated National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (Nasams) from the US. France has promised radar and air defence systems in the coming weeks while Canada said it would provide artillery rounds and winter clothing and Britain pledged to donate Amraam anti-aircraft missiles capable of shooting down cruise missiles. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi had warned earlier that the loss of off-site power at the facility, Europe’s largest, was “deeply worrying”. Ukrainians are being reduce their electricity consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. Prime minister Denys Shmyhal appealed to citizens and businesses to reduce power consumption from 5pm to 10pm by 25%. “This is a necessity and this is our contribution to the victory. After all, it depends on each of us how we will get through this winter,” he said. The European Commission will next week present plans to mitigate soaring energy costs. Energy commissioner Kadri Simson told reporters on Wednesday that the commission would bring forward a proposal that includes joint gas purchases by 2023. By harnessing the bloc’s collective purchasing power, she said, the EU could “avoid member states outbidding each other on the market” and thus “driving up” prices. Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, Putin said in an address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas. There is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity, Alexei Miller said, adding that gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/30/uk-isolated-as-eu-agrees-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-30T14:41:19Z","webTitle":"UK isolated as EU agrees windfall tax on energy firms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/30/uk-isolated-as-eu-agrees-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/30/uk-isolated-as-eu-agrees-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms","fields":{"headline":"UK isolated as EU agrees windfall tax on energy firms","bodyText":"EU energy ministers have agreed to levy windfall taxes on energy companies’ profits, and to cut electricity use, but remain at loggerheads over proposals to cap the price of gas. Meeting in Brussels on Friday, the bloc’s 27 energy ministers signed off on proposals to levy a “solidarity contribution” on fossil fuel producers that have benefited from soaring energy prices. Revenues of renewable energy and nuclear power companies will be capped in response to the “unexpectedly large financial gains” made in recent months, as a result of their profits being linked to the price of expensive gas and coal, according to an EU statement. The measures, which together could raise €140bn (£123bn) to help lower consumer bills and fund the switch to green energy across the EU, contrast with the British government’s approach. Liz Truss, the UK prime minister, has ruled out extending the £5bn energy tax introduced by the former chancellor Rishi Sunak. Unlike the UK, the EU is also moving ahead with plans to reduce demand for energy. Ministers agreed on a voluntary target to cut electricity use by 10% and a mandatory energy savings target of 5% during peak hours. The mandatory peak hours target was deemed necessary to avoid power being simply moved from most to least efficient countries in the EU’s shared electricity market. The 10% cut in electricity use is meant to be achieved between 1 December and the end of March. A 15% voluntary target for cutting gas consumption over the winter was agreed in July. EU officials said if the demand-reduction plans were successful, governments would earn less than the estimated €140bn from windfall taxes, but consumers would benefit from lower bills. The emergency measures were agreed after a 37% decline in gas supplies from Russia to the EU between January and August, following the invasion of Ukraine. The risks to EU energy supply were further exposed this week when four leaks were found in two Nord Stream gas pipelines, believed by EU leaders to be acts of sabotage. Despite the consensus on a windfall tax and energy savings, ministers remain divided over plans to cap the price of gas. France, Italy, Spain and Poland were among 15 countries this week urging the European Commission to table a price cap as “the one measure that will help every member state to mitigate the inflationary pressure, manage expectations and provide a framework in case of potential supply disruptions, and limit the extra profits in the sector”. The Czech Republic’s industry minister, Jozef Síkela, who chaired Friday’s meeting, called on the commission to table additional measures targeted at reducing gas prices as soon as possible. “The households and businesses need the help now. We are in the energy war with Russia and we need to act. Now means now … Now is not in a week and definitely not in a month,” he said. Germany, the Netherlands and EU officials, however, are sceptical about a price cap, fearing it could harm the EU’s ability to secure scarce supplies of liquified natural gas in a competitive global market. Critics also say the system would require an EU authority to allocate and ration gas to member states, a politically fraught task never done at EU level. Luxembourg’s energy minister, Claude Turmes, said capping the wholesale price of gas had risks. “What happens when the clearing is not happening? Who will then decide where gas goes? [Is the] European Commission to decide? … Look, I think this is a system that can be very, very difficult to administer.” The commission continues to favour capping the price of Russian gas, a measure that has the support of only the Baltic states and is unlikely to pass. Kadri Simson, the EU energy commissioner, said the commission was “ready to develop a temporary EU-wide measure to limit the price of gas in electricity generation”, which she described as a far-reaching step. “A wholesale gas price cap is a legitimate option,” she told reporters, “but it requires a radical intervention in the market which means several non-negotiable conditions have to be met before this cap will work.” One of those conditions, she said, would be a gas-savings target going beyond the 15% already set. Riina Sikkut, Estonia’s infrastructure minister, rejected suggestions that Europeans faced a choice between heating and eating. “We can’t forget that we are in a situation of war,” she said. “Ukrainians are paying with their lives. So we may temporarily pay higher bills or prices in the food store.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/06/ukraine-motivational-messaging-maintains-morale-as-winter-bites","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T13:47:55Z","webTitle":"Ukraine’s motivational messaging maintains morale as winter bites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/06/ukraine-motivational-messaging-maintains-morale-as-winter-bites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/06/ukraine-motivational-messaging-maintains-morale-as-winter-bites","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine’s motivational messaging maintains morale as winter bites","bodyText":"Adverts on Ukraine’s underground system carry motivational messaging: “Together to the victory”, “Bravery is carrying on” or “Just a bit more and it will get easier”. Psychologists are invited on to television shows almost daily to offer tips on how to manage anxiety and the breaks are filled with videos in support of the army. Positive messaging, mental health advice, and examples of how to “do your bit” are all part of the information ecosystem helping Ukrainians sustain their morale throughout the war. Experts say this partly top-down, partly organic approach will play a significant role in supporting Ukrainians through what is likely to be a punishing winter. Ukrainian TV channels are running a series of adverts on how people can save energy amid government pleas for consumers to reduce usage. Under the slogan “The rules of a warm country”, one video advises people to use alternative methods to keep warm, including using hot water bottles and cats, as well as getting together with neighbours. There are also several segments a day featuring Ukrainians across the country demonstrating how they have prepared for winter. One man recently interviewed said in the event of no electricity or gas, he would pitch a tent inside his flat and sleep in a sleeping bag. Breathing inside a small tent, he said, will maintain the heat better than a room. On social media, Ukrainians are sharing infographics on which appliances use the most electricity and videos of the recent trend of making candles-come-stoves for soldiers in the trenches. This winter, Ukraine is facing the frightening prospect of sub-zero temperatures with bouts of no electricity, water and even heating. For the last month, Russia has been targeting critical elements of Ukraine’s energy sector with a combination of missiles, rockets, and Iranian-supplied drones. On Monday alone, Russia targeted at least seven regional power stations and since then they have attacked at least another three, according to Ukraine’s authorities. Ukrainian repair workers and energy dispatchers have been quick to reconnect and reroute supplies and scheduled blackouts have been rolled out in several regions, including the capital, Kyiv, to stabilise the electricity grid. But Ukraine’s officials have warned that these short shutdowns are probably just a small taste of what’s to come. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the head of Ukraine’s state energy company, Ukrenergo, said this week that if the Russian attacks continued, “power cuts in Ukraine will become longer and longer”. Kudrytskyi said Ukrenergo could not repair the grid as quickly as it was being destroyed. According to him, “virtually all” major non-nuclear power stations in the country have been hit, including 30% of the substations. The head of Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said his office was preparing for the event that blackouts may last as long as two weeks. The news of yet more bad times ahead has, however, not made a discernible dent in the country’s morale. According to Volodymyr Kulyk, a leading professor of sociology, Ukrainians remain defiant and want to demonstrate that. “People increasingly perceive Russia as a genocidal actor … [and] are ready to sacrifice to remain free and remain themselves,” said Kulyk. “[Messages of defiance] are both stemming from people themselves and also disseminated centrally from the government, the media and influencers.” The top-down messages – particularly those from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the daily update from Ukraine’s general staff – play a therapeutic role for many Ukrainians, Kulyk said. “We need this news to know that everything is OK and there is no disaster with the Ukrainian army,” he said. All of the state agencies make their own motivational videos – the fire services, police, the ministry of defence, as well as the TV channels and private companies. “These societal adverts that show heroism, of course, make [people] proud,” said Ostapa, the head of Detector Media, a media-monitoring organisation. Psychiatrists and psychologists are regularly invited on Ukrainian TV to discuss how people can identify mental health problems in themselves and their loved ones. How to talk to children about the war is a particularly prominent topic. Oleh Chuban, the head of psychiatry at a leading medical university in Ukraine and a regular guest on TV, said he aimed to tell people that what they are feeling was normal. “The fact that people are worried and anxious, chopping firewood, buying up all the generators, is a normal reaction. Only an idiot wouldn’t react to someone telling them that there will be power, water and heating outages,” said Chaban. “People are saving themselves, just like during Covid 19.” “The media has a big influence [on people] so I try to give them optimism and explain their worries are natural and demonstrate that they living people with (functioning) emotions,” said Chaban. On Tuesday, Zelenskiy spoke to the nation stressing the need for perseverance. “Instead of overcoming poverty in their country, the Russian leadership spends everything not to admit what a historical mistake they made with this war against Ukraine,” he said. “Patience is needed to prove that the hope for the winter for Russian terrorists will not come true. I am sure we will get through this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/12/centrica-and-edf-are-at-the-table-now-uk-ministers-must-strike-a-fair-electricity-price","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-12T18:23:48Z","webTitle":"Centrica and EDF are at the table – now UK ministers must strike a fair electricity price","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/12/centrica-and-edf-are-at-the-table-now-uk-ministers-must-strike-a-fair-electricity-price","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/12/centrica-and-edf-are-at-the-table-now-uk-ministers-must-strike-a-fair-electricity-price","fields":{"headline":"Centrica and EDF are at the table – now UK ministers must strike a fair electricity price","bodyText":"Centrica and EDF, the duo behind the UK’s current fleet of nuclear power stations, have read the political breezes, sensed the popular mood and come to the correct conclusion: they’re up for a negotiation with government to cap the price of electricity. So they should be, of course. Even if the size of windfall profits being collected by generators is currently unclear, nobody doubts the fact of outsized returns when current forward-selling contracts fall away. The wholesale price of electricity, absurdly, is tied to the price of gas, creating nonsensical outcomes in those corners of the generation market where input prices are virtually unchanged. One could, perhaps, be slightly nervous that Centrica and EDF have volunteered for duty so speedily. The companies aren’t charities and they’ll be looking for something for themselves – namely medium or long-term guarantees on prices. That worry, though, is really an argument for transparency when the deal-making begins. At this stage, willingness to come to the table is what matters. It’s up to ministers, if they’re really dead-set against new windfall taxes, to thrash out decent terms to protect the public purse. So where are the other corporate volunteers? Drax, as a biomass-based business, tends to be overlooked in the focus on nuclear, wind and solar generators, but it is in exactly the same lucky economic boat. Burning wood pellets to generate power is a lucrative business if you’re being paid as if you’re a gas generator. Witness the jump in Drax’s profits, and two-thirds improvement in the share price, since wholesale energy started to climb last autumn. Since Drax is also the beneficiary of stupendous support under current arrangements (thinktank Ember calculates that from 2012 until 2027, the company will have collected more than £11bn in government subsidies), it ought to have been the first company to say it will come to the table. Will Drax play ball? Aside from a few boiler-plate words about working in partnership with government, Drax on Monday was gloriously unclear about its readiness to negotiate. Not good enough. Get with the programme. Reasons to admire outgoing Serco CEO’s corporate rescue job Serco is one of those companies that is doomed never to enjoy popular acclaim and affection – or even, in some quarters, acceptance. That’s life. Nor is suspicion remotely surprising given that the outsourcing firm only emerged a few months ago from a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Serious Fraud Office related to past shenanigans with electronic tagging contracts for prisoners. There are, though, two strong reasons to admire the corporate rescue job performed by chief executive Rupert Soames, who on Monday announced his looming retirement (“outsourcing myself”, as he put it). The first is that Serco still exists. Back in 2014, survival wasn’t guaranteed. Aside from the scandal with tags, Soames inherited a £1.5bn annual loss and a chunk of contracts that made no commercial sense for the provider. The company was an operational and balance-sheet mess. Soames served up a £150m rights issue as an amuse bouche on day one, and made investors swallow a £550m thumper the following year. Both fundraisers were essentially acts of faith on the part of investors. Turnaround wasn’t quick, but the new strategic direction has been vindicated. Today’s Serco is a government-only contractor with a greater international spread (particularly in North America) and a bias towards defence. Progress from the 100p rights issue price to today’s 168p has been steady, rather than spectacular, but that is roughly what low-margin contractors should deliver: a touch of reliability. Investors have been much better off by owning Serco in the period than outsourcing twin Capita (let alone its cousin, the late and unlamented Carillion). Soames, 63, will be replaced by Mark Irwin, who seems to have been earmarked for succession for a while. One hopes the new man has digested the second lesson of the Soames era: speak plainly, acknowledge that outsourcing is controversial and be prepared to debate your critics. A few non-believers will never accept that public services should be delivered by private companies. The rest of us know that it is often a better way to deliver value for money – but we do still want maximum transparency from the providers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-27T17:27:59Z","webTitle":"Defeat would leave Russia brutal and vindictive even if Putin ‘disappeared’, says RAF chief – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","fields":{"headline":"Defeat would leave Russia brutal and vindictive even if Putin ‘disappeared’, says RAF chief – as it happened","bodyText":"Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines. Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counteroffensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported. Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted. A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram. Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine. Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move. Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year. Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s Executive Board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine, which it invaded 15 months ago, from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva. Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The death toll from a Russian missile attack on an outpatient clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has risen to two, with 30 people wounded, according to media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “Russian terrorists once again confirm their status of fighters against everything humane and honest.” Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to visit Finland, Sweden and Norway from this Monday to deepen cooperation on top national security and economic issues, the US state department has said. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland has joined Nato, with Sweden’s bid to join awaiting ratification from Hungary and Turkey. A deal allowing the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports has not yet resumed full operations, the UN said on Friday, having come to a halt before Russia’s decision last week to extend it. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told China’s special envoy Li Hui there are “serious obstacles” to resuming peace talks, blaming Ukraine and western countries. Meanwhile, Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decades and negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was in power. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and former US president Donald Trump discussed Ukraine and “the vital importance of Ukrainian victory” on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson said. Two years ago, Raman Pratasevich, a young Belarusian dissident blogger, was white-knuckled, begging a Ryanair flight crew not to make an emergency landing at Minsk airport, writes Andrew Roth and Shaun Walker. He said: “Don’t do this, they will kill me, I am a refugee,” according to a fellow passenger. The plane, escorted by a Belarusian Mig-29 fighter jet sent to force it down, landed anyway. Pratasevich was promptly arrested. Last week he emerged from custody. The activist and blogger, accused of more than 1,586 crimes, was charged on 10 counts including conspiracy to seize power. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and then promptly pardoned, his reward from Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko for becoming a full-throated mouthpiece of the regime. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has tweeted this video footage. Around 400 Ukrainian soldiers have started training on American M1 Abrams tanks in Germany, the New York Times reported. Half of the group started training in Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels in southern Germany, being taught medical skills and how to shoot firearms. The other half were taught how to fuel and maintain the tanks. Around 31 tanks were due to be sent to Germany to be used in the training programme, which is expected to last 10 to 12 weeks, according to the newspaper. A 73-year-old woman has died and two others have been injured after Russian troops shelled 16 areas in Zaporizhzhia, a local Ukrainian governor said. Yurii Malashko reported that Russia had launched 108 attacks against the southeastern city in one day using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, and drones. Malashko wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “The enemy will be held accountable for every war crime, for every broken fate and life that has been cut short. Ukrainians are strong and unbreakable, Victory is ours.” The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 6pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s headlines: Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines.

The death toll from a Russian missile attack on an outpatient clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has risen to two, with 30 people wounded, according to media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “Russian terrorists once again confirm their status of fighters against everything humane and honest.” Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to visit Finland, Sweden and Norway from this Monday to deepen cooperation on top national security and economic issues, the US state department has said. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland has joined Nato, with Sweden’s bid to join awaiting ratification from Hungary and Turkey. A deal allowing the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports has not yet resumed full operations, the UN said on Friday, having come to a halt before Russia’s decision last week to extend it. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told China’s special envoy Li Hui there are “serious obstacles” to resuming peace talks, blaming Ukraine and western countries. Meanwhile, Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decades and negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was in power. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and former US president Donald Trump discussed Ukraine and “the vital importance of Ukrainian victory” on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson said. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s Executive Board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine, which it invaded 15 months ago, from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva. Normally those joining the forum, which plays a key role in the governance of the WHO, are elected on the nod but Moscow forced the first vote since 1977 at this year’s 76th assembly. In the event, the vote was easily carried by 123 votes to 13. Russia’s delegation stated: “We deeply regret the fact that the assembly has voted for a country that will simply further politicise the work of the EB,” saying it opposed “politicisation of the work of the WHA and of the WHO as a whole.” There was further acrimony at the gathering after the United States said it regretted the extension of a place for North Korea after it was put forward by South East Asia. Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine has not publicly acknowledged launching attacks against targets inside Russia. The Ukrainian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday, Reuters reported. In the Tver region, which lies just north-west of Moscow, two drones attacked a station that serves the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline, one of the world’s largest oil pipelines, the Kommersant newspaper said. The Tver local council said that a drone had crashed near the village of Erokhino, about 500 km (310 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The Telegram channel Baza, which has good sources among Russia’s security services, said the drones attacked a station serving the Druzhba pipeline. Preliminary operations have already begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of de-occupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines. “The intensity is increasing, but it will take quite a long period of time,” he added, predicting that as the counteroffensive gathered momentum, there would be more incursions into Russia by Russian rebel groups, such as the raid in Belgorod region earlier this week. On Saturday the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, raised expectations that a major operation could be imminent by declaring on social media: “The time has come to take back what’s ours.” Zaluzhnyi’s declaration on the Telegram messaging app was accompanied by a cinematic video showing heavily armed Ukrainian soldiers preparing for battle to a soundtrack of ominous music and a narrator reciting a prayer calling for strength to “annihilate” Ukraine’s enemies. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported. More on the expulsion of German diplomats from Russia (see 12:53pm). Germany has said more than 100 employees will be withdrawn after Moscow imposed limits on the numbers allowed to work at diplomatic missions in Russia, a source with the German foreign ministry said on Saturday. “This limit, set by Russia for the beginning of June, requires a major cut in all areas of our presence in Russia,” the source said, Reuters reports. Those affected included teachers, as well as other employees of schools and the Goethe Institute, and was necessary to maintain the right balance for Germany’s diplomatic presence, said the person, who described the number affected as at least 100. Relations between Russia and Germany, which used to be the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas, have broken down since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the west responded with sanctions and weapons supplies. The source called the limit, announced in April, “unilateral, unjustified and incomprehensible”. The person declined to say what the limit imposed by Moscow was. The number of German employees leaving was earlier reported by Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung. Russia’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year. The German foreign ministry criticised Russia’s move, calling it an “unilateral, unjustified and incomprehensible decision”. The expulsions will affect several hundred German state employees, including teachers and staff of the Goethe Institute, which promotes German culture and language abroad, the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported. It comes in response to the reduction of the presence of Russian intelligence services in Germany earlier this year. A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Matsuno also condemned Russia’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying it would further inflame the situation and that Japan would never accept “Russia’s nuclear menace, let alone its use”. Russia’s foreign ministry said it was assessing the implementation of Japan’s sanctions on its national security and economy and would not leave Tokyo’s “illegitimate actions” unanswered, Reuters reported. The ministry also took issue with Matsuno’s casting of Russia as engaging in “nuclear blackmail”. Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted. He said: When the Ukraine conflict is over and Ukraine has restored its borders, as it must, we will have a damaged, vindictive, and brutal Russia, whose means of harming us is through air attack, missile attack and subsurface attack. Sir Mike is set to step down next month after four years at the top of the RAF. He added: But it also demonstrates that this is more than about just one person. There is a whole structure and a hierarchy behind Putin. So even if Putin was to disappear off the stage, there are countless others that could replace him that could be as equally as brutal and vicious to their own people and to neighbouring states. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. “Yesterday and today there have not been any active battles – neither in the city nor on the flanks,” she wrote, adding that Moscow’s troops were instead shelling the outskirts and approaches to Bakhmut. “The decrease in the enemy’s offensive activity is due to the fact that troops are being replaced and regrouped,” Maliar said. “The enemy is trying to strengthen its own capabilities.” She added that Ukrainian troops “firmly hold” the heights overlooking Bakhmut from the north and south, as well as a portion of the outskirts, but have not advanced during the past two days to focus on “other tasks”. Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine. If it supplied the missiles, Germany would be following in the footsteps of Britain, which earlier in May became the first country to publicly provide Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles. The United States has so far declined to supply Ukraine with the 297-km range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles amid concerns that Ukraine could use them to strike inside Russia’s internationally recognised borders. Ukraine has been asking for months for these kind of weapons, but support from western allies has focused on shorter-range weapons Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move. Biden said on Friday he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has moved ahead with a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reported. The US state department denounced the Russian nuclear deployment plan. “It is the sovereign right of Russia and Belarus to ensure their security by means we deem necessary amid of a large-scale hybrid war unleashed by Washington against us,” Russia’s embassy in the United States said in a statement. “The measures we undertake are fully consistent with our international legal obligations.” The US has said the world faces the gravest nuclear danger since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis because of remarks by Vladimir Putin during the Ukraine conflict, but Moscow says its position has been misinterpreted. Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. Iran initially denied supplying Shahed drones to Russia but later said it had provided a small number before the conflict began. Ukraine says the drones have played a major role in Russia’s attacks on cities and infrastructure. “The Ukrainian president’s repeat of delusional claims against the Islamic Republic of Iran is in line with the anti-Iranian propaganda and media war aimed at attracting as many arms and financial aid as possible from western countries,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement carried by Iranian media. Ukraine, Kanaani said, has been refusing to allow an independent investigation into these claims. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. He had extensively reported on mass protests against Lukashenko and refused to leave the Moscow-allied country after authorities unleashed an historic crackdown on dissent. Belarus’s supreme court said in a statement that the sentence was “left unchanged”. The verdict has come into force. Poczobut, 50, who stood trial in his home city of Grodno, near the Polish border, was found guilty of taking part in “actions harming national security” and “inciting hatred”. Poland, Belarus’s western EU-member neighbour, has condemned the trial and called for his release. After Poczobut’s appeal was rejected, Warsaw said it would impose new punitive measures against Lukashenko’s regime next week. The Polish interior minister, Mariusz Kaminski, said on Twitter: On Monday, I will announce the decision to add to the sanctions list several hundred representatives of the Lukashenko regime responsible for political repression, including repression against Poles living in Belarus. Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counter-offensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian defence ministry’s intelligence directorate said Russian forces would soon shell the plant and then announce a radiation leak. This would force an investigation by international authorities, during which all hostilities would be stopped. The directorate’s statement, posted on Telegram, did not provide any proof. It said Russia had disrupted the planned rotation of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who are based at the plant. The agency, which frequently posts updates on the plant, has made no mention of any disruption. Last week witnesses said Russian military forces had been enhancing defensive positions in and around the plant ahead of the counter-offensive. Ukraine is ready to launch its much-anticipated counteroffensive against Russian forces, a senior Ukrainian official has told the BBC. The broadcaster reported that Oleksiy Danilov would not name a date but said an assault to retake territory from President Vladimir Putin’s occupying forces could begin “tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week”. He said Kyiv had “no right to make a mistake” on the decision because it was an “historic opportunity” that “we cannot lose”. As secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Danilov is at the heart of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s de facto war cabinet. Danilov also told the BBC he was “absolutely calm” about Russia beginning to deploy nuclear weapons to Belarus, saying: “To us, it’s not some kind of news.” The Wagner mercenary group’s forces have probably begun to withdraw from some of their positions around the devastated Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and are likely to be used for other offensive operations in the Donbas region, according to British intelligence. The UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update that Wagner’s owner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, had said the withdrawal had begun and positions were being transferred to Russian defence ministry forces. Kyiv corroborated Wagner’s rotation out from the city’s outskirts. The UK ministry said in its update, posted on Twitter, that forces of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic had probably entered the eastern Ukrainian city since Wednesday to start “clearance operations”. Bakhmut has been the scene of the war’s longest and bloodiest battle. The ministry said: Ukrainian forces had taken 20 square kilometres of Bakhmut’s flanks as of 16 May. The rotation out of Wagner forces is likely to continue in controlled phases to prevent collapse in pockets around Bakhmut. Despite Prigozhin’s ongoing feud with the Russian MOD [ministry of defence], Wagner forces will likely be used for further offensive operations in the Donbas following reconstituting its forces. US president Joe Biden has said he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has moved ahead with its plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, while the European Union has condemned the plan. Reuters reports that the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said: This is a step which will lead to further extremely dangerous escalation. Russia signed a pact with Belarus on Thursday about the storage of the warheads, at a facility due to be finished in just over a month. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said later that the relocation of some of the weapons had already begun. Borrell said the agreement contravened multiple international agreements. We call on Russia to abide by these commitments. The Belarusian regime is an accomplice in Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. Borrell said any attempt “to further escalate the situation will be met by a strong and coordinated reaction”. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton and here’s an overview of the latest. The European Union has condemned Russia’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in neighbouring Belarus, while US president Joe Biden says he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has already begun moving ahead with the plan. More on that story soon. In other news: The death toll from a Russian missile attack on an outpatient clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has risen to two, with 30 people wounded, according to media reports.

The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said in a phone call with his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, that Russia is open to dialogue over Ukraine. Lula tweeted that he had reiterated Brazil’s willingness to talk to both sides of the war in Ukraine but declined Putin’s invitation to visit. Russia has blamed Kyiv for dozens of strikes on its southern Belgorod region. Its governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the Ukrainian military was responsible for artillery, mortar and drone attacks across the region over 24 hours but reported no casualties. In a rare attack on the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, east of Crimea, two drones damaged buildings in the city centre, officials said. In the neighbouring Rostov region, the governor said a Ukrainian missile had been shot down near Morozovsk, where there is a Russian airbase. Canada will donate 43 AIM-9 missiles to Ukraine to help the country “secure its skies”, the national defence has said. “Canada’s support for Ukraine is unwavering,” said Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. The country also said it welcomed Ukraine’s application to join the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership (CPTPP). Moscow’s city court will hold a preliminary hearing next Wednesday in a new criminal case against the jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on charges including incitement to extremism. The Russian arms company Kalashnikov, maker of the world’s most widely used assault rifle, is launching a division for the production of kamikaze drones – a key weapon used in the Ukraine war. Ukraine said it shot down 10 missiles and 25 drones launched by Russia in overnight attacks on the capital of Kyiv, the city of Dnipro and eastern regions. Several drones and missiles hit targets in the Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, officials said on Friday. There was no immediate word of any deaths. The city of Donetsk has come under fire from Ukrainian forces, the Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said. As a result, he said, a young woman died and another was injured. Japan will place additional sanctions on Russia after the Group of Seven (G7) summit the country hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/31/hopes-for-power-and-purpose-from-an-energy-industry-in-flux","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-31T16:00:22Z","webTitle":"Hopes for power and purpose from an energy industry in flux","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/31/hopes-for-power-and-purpose-from-an-energy-industry-in-flux","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/31/hopes-for-power-and-purpose-from-an-energy-industry-in-flux","fields":{"headline":"Hopes for power and purpose from an energy industry in flux","bodyText":"A tall white rig punctures the Cornish skyline, offering a hint of a new industrial era at a site near Redruth, once a copper mining capital. This year, the first power produced by a geothermal plant in the UK is expected from a project three decades in the making. The United Downs project aims to produce constant low-carbon electricity for the grid, and heat for homes, from hot rocks. Geothermal energy is an established power source in volcanically active areas of the globe, often near tectonic plate boundaries. However, it can also be used in other areas if the rock temperature is high enough, and the rocks are permeable enough for water to circulate. The project is developed by Geothermal Engineering and has received funding from the EU and Cornwall county council. Its introduction to the electricity generation mix will come in a year which could prove defining for a British energy industry that has spent the past 12 months in crisis mode. Here’s what other changes and challenges the sector can expect in 2023: Renewed impetus for renewables The importance of renewable power sources was underlined in 2022. The invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring and left countries paying through the nose for gas to replace Russian supplies, and hit household and public finances. Expect a fresh focus on new renewable projects this year, in part as a result of the lifting of the ban on onshore wind in England. Meanwhile, Scotland’s largest offshore windfarm – the £3bn Seagreen project, a joint venture between SSE Renewables and France’s TotalEnergies – is expected to be fully operational by the summer. An even bigger windfarm, at Dogger Bank 80 miles off the north-east coast of England, should also deliver its first power by the summer. And another SSE project, Coire Glas, is taking shape: it will be the first large-scale pumped hydroelectric storage scheme for more than 30 years and should provide a significant backup when wind and solar power are not available. It could also prove a crucial year for executives behind the £18bn project to connect Britain with a huge wind and solar farm in the Sahara through an undersea cable. They hope to secure a “contract for difference” with government – meaning they would receive public subsidies to give them a fixed price for power – as the clock ticks on the project. Nuclear vision The £30bn Sizewell C nuclear power station development in Suffolk became emblematic of the political tumult of 2021 – as the planning decision on its future was repeatedly delayed, before eventually being given the green light by Boris Johnson. It then looked in doubt amid Liz Truss’s mini-budget chaos before the government announced a £700m cash injection which also eased out China General Nuclear. This year, bankers will hope to finally land other backers to complement developer EDF and the government in the project. Could British Gas owner Centrica commit to investment? Rolls-Royce will hope to gain some momentum behind its long-awaited small modular reactor programme. Fossil fuels hang on The role of polluting fuels in Britain’s energy mix was high on the agenda in 2022, as fossil fuel firms faced a windfall tax on their Ukraine-inflated profits but were asked to step in to ensure security of supplies this winter. The government is set to award 130 new licences for North Sea oil and gas exploration by the summer, although the move faces a legal challenge. The futures of the huge Cambo and Rosebank fields remain uncertain but could get the green light this year. Green campaigners will also hope to see more progress in the transition away from coal after the approval of the first new coalmine for three decades, in Cumbria, and deals to keep coal plants running this winter. Britain has committed to end the use of coal power by October 2024. Regulations revamp The biggest redesign of the electricity market in a generation began this year in the form of the Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (Rema). A key part of the work will be de-linking gas and electricity prices as Britain shifts towards renewable power. Green energy suppliers have bemoaned the link between the surging cost of natural gas, after the invasion of Ukraine, and high power prices. Policymakers are attempting to create a market better suited to a greater proportion of renewables, by improving grid connections for windfarms and battery storage sites. Significant proposals for reform are expected in 2023. Heavy industrial companies are hoping new regulations, designed to encourage investment in hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, are completed to ease the path to decarbonisation. Generation flex Industry watchers have long predicted that consumers could take a more active role in Britain’s energy network. This year saw the introduction of a National Grid scheme, first trialled by Octopus, which saw households paid to turn limit energy usage at peak times. And with electric vehicle ownership increasing, the potential is growing for drivers to play a part in storing and pushing power back to the grid with car batteries. Octopus’s bosses will hope it can keep pushing innovation in these areas while integrating Bulb, the bust energy supplier which it has acquired in the face of a legal challenge from rivals. Counting the cost The biggest unknown for the energy industry this year is how gas prices will fare. While prices have begun easing in recent weeks thanks to warmer than average weather, wholesale natural gas costs are forecast to remain high across Europe in 2023, with few cheap options to replace the huge volume of Russian fuel lost to the market. Those prices will affect the cost of the energy price guarantee, the government’s measure to protect households from huge bills, which becomes less generous from April. However, signs of a global recession could further pull down the price of oil and fuel. Ministers may feel the energy crisis is under control, but it looks far from over. • This article was amended on 4 January 2023. An earlier version referred to volcanic activity “near to tectonic plates”. However, plates cover the surface of the earth, so volcanic areas are on, rather than near, plates. It has been corrected to convey that geothermal resources are often found “near tectonic plate boundaries”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/18/ukraine-says-30-of-its-power-plants-destroyed-in-last-eight-days","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-18T17:00:27Z","webTitle":"Ukraine says 30% of its power plants destroyed in last eight days","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/18/ukraine-says-30-of-its-power-plants-destroyed-in-last-eight-days","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/18/ukraine-says-30-of-its-power-plants-destroyed-in-last-eight-days","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine says 30% of its power plants destroyed in last eight days","bodyText":"Nearly a third of Ukraine’s power stations have been destroyed by Russian attacks since Monday last week – prompting Nato’s secretary general to announce that new counter-drone defences would be delivered within days. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of engaging in “terrorist attacks” with its missiles and Iranian-made drones, while British ministers attended emergency meetings in Washington on how to counteract them. Zelenskiy tweeted: “Since Oct 10, 30% of Ukraine’s power stations have been destroyed, causing massive blackouts across the country.” Attacks on civilian infrastructure meant there was “no space left for negotiations with Putin’s regime”. The bombing is often inaccurate and civilians have been killed in residential buildings in Kyiv and other big cities. But enough have got through to cause problems for a power grid already short of generation after the Zaprorizhzhia nuclear power plant was shut down. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidential office, said energy infrastructure and power supply were targeted overnight in an eastern district of Kyiv, where two people were killed, and in the cities of Dnipro and Zhytomyr. “The situation is critical now across the country because our regions are dependent on one another … it’s necessary for the whole country to prepare for electricity, water and heating outages,” Tymoshenko told Ukrainian television. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said member countries would “step up” and deliver more air defences to help stabilise the situation. “Nato will in the coming days deliver counter-drone systems to counter the specific threat of drones, including those from Iran,” he said. Russia has been targeting Ukraine with a mixture of missiles and, more recently, Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones, rebranded as Geran-2 by the attackers. Although there are signs that Moscow is running short on guided missiles, it has acquired up to 2,400 of the drones, according to Ukraine, and is using them as cheaper substitutes to hit the energy targets and strike fear into civilians. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he did not have any information about their origin. “Russian equipment with Russian names is being used,” Peskov said. Ukraine, experts and western governments believe the Gerans are rebranded Shahed drones, identifiable by their distinctive delta wing shape and from an examination of fragments recovered from the ground. A western official, speaking on condition of anonymity in a briefing on Tuesday, said they believed Russia was “pursuing a deliberate strategy of attempting to destroy Ukraine’s electricity network”. It was “not in doubt”, the official said, “where these weapons were coming from”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he would ask Zelenskiy to cut diplomatic ties with Tehran – while presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak asked what Iran had got in return from Russia, speculating that it could be uranium, “nuclear technologies”, or some other guarantee. Reuters reported that Iran had promised to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles, in addition to more drones, citing two senior Iranian officials and two Iranian diplomats. Germany said that Iran should be punished with “further sanctions” after the recent spate of drone attacks. Its ambassador to the UK, Miguel Berger, said Tehran had helped Russia “terrorise civilians in Ukraine with their kamikaze drones” and there were “worrying reports” that Iran might sell missiles to Moscow. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, flew to Washington on Tuesday to discuss how to respond to Iran’s intervention, as officials briefed that a new air defence package for Ukraine was being prepared. A western official said a lot of colleagues within the western alliance were “looking at what the right package might be to support the Ukrainians”. Last week Germany delivered the first of four Iris-T air defence systems it had promised to supply Ukraine, but the US has been wary of strengthening Ukraine’s air force and defences for fear it would be seen as an escalation. Two “objects of critical infrastructure” were damaged in Kyiv on Tuesday, said the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and electricity and water supply in “many houses” in east Kyiv was “partially limited”. The mayor appealed to residents to conserve electricity by turning off air conditioners, electric kettles and microwaves, and said houses experiencing reduced water pressure should use water as “economically as possible”. All of Zhytomyr was without electricity and water after a double missile strike on an energy facility, said the mayor, Serhiy Sukhomlyn. Hospitals were running on backup power, he said. Russia said on Tuesday that its forces were maintaining strikes against military and energy infrastructure targets, and that it had used what it described as high-precision, long-range air- and sea-based weapons. The targets were “military command and energy infrastructure of Ukraine, as well as arsenals with ammunition and foreign-made weapons”, it said. “All assigned objects were hit,” it added.

The surface-to-air missile was believed to have been fired by Syrian air defences against Israeli jets that were bombing a site near Damascus, but the path it flew initially led to speculation that Israel’s most sensitive site may have instead been a target. The defence minister, Benny Gantz, claimed the missile had landed in Israel as a result of errant Syrian anti-aircraft fire. In doing so he raised concerns about the effectiveness of his country’s vaunted air defence capabilities, which have been entrusted to counter such threats. Gantz said Israel’s anti-missile systems had attempted to intercept the SA-5 but were unsuccessful. “In most cases we achieve other results. This is a slightly more complex case. We will investigate it and move on,” he said The incident follows the publication of an analysis in an Iranian newspaper at the weekend that called for the Dimona reactor to be targeted to avenge an apparent Israeli sabotage operation at the Natanz nuclear site in Iran a fortnight ago. Syria is a staunch ally of Iran, and Iranian forces use Syrian territory to stockpile weapons to supply to its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah. However, despite hundreds of Israeli attacks targeting Iranian interests, Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, has remained reluctant to launch offensive attacks against Israel, fearing his war-ravaged country could be drawn into a broader conflict with a technically superior foe. Directly firing a large missile at Dimona could have been a trigger for such an escalation. Instead, Israeli officials claim that the impact of the missile was likely to have been inadvertent, and are now focusing on how its various defence systems failed to intercept it. The missile landed around 20 miles short of the Dimona site, in Israel’s Negev desert. Israel has some of the most tightly protected airspace in the world and has shot down drones and missiles at various points over the past decade, including during a similar incident in early 2017 in which one Syrian missile downed an Israeli jet and another landed in the country’s north. Air raid sirens sounded at about 1.30am in Abu Krinat, a village in Israel’s desert. Security sources said the projectile exploded in mid-air – a common technique used by anti-aircraft missiles to guarantee they hit jets – and that fragments landing on the ground. Israel’s military said its forces responded to the missile by bombing the “battery from which the missile was launched and additional Syrian surface-to-air batteries in the area”. With tensions already high with Iran, Israel may be seen as wanting to play down any attempted attack or risk a confrontation. Still, Israel has in the past been quick to blame Syria or Iran for other alleged strikes, including when it accused Iranian forces of firing rockets at its troops in 2018. Israel and Iran have fought an increasingly open war across the region in the past three years, with more than 1,000 airstrikes inside Syria and Iraq, missiles fired, and mines placed by both sides against commercial shipping, and the assassination of Iranian nuclear officials, which western intelligence agencies have blamed on Israel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/oct/18/amol-rajan-interviews-greta-thunberg-review-she-is-doomed-to-the-pure-hell-of-arguing-with-people","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-18T19:15:03Z","webTitle":"Amol Rajan Interviews Greta Thunberg review – she is doomed to the pure hell of arguing with people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/oct/18/amol-rajan-interviews-greta-thunberg-review-she-is-doomed-to-the-pure-hell-of-arguing-with-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/oct/18/amol-rajan-interviews-greta-thunberg-review-she-is-doomed-to-the-pure-hell-of-arguing-with-people","fields":{"headline":"Amol Rajan Interviews Greta Thunberg review – she is doomed to the pure hell of arguing with people","bodyText":"What must it be like to be Greta Thunberg? To be, at 19 years of age, the most recognised climate crisis campaigner in the world, shouldering the burden of averting – or at this late stage, merely softening – the biggest calamity humanity has ever faced? What can that possibly feel like? At the end of Amol Rajan Interviews Greta Thunberg (BBC Two), the conversation becomes more personal and we get a few answers: how Thunberg doesn’t enjoy being stopped in the street and certainly doesn’t appreciate threats to her family; how she despairs at being told her presence reassures people about the future of the planet, because it implies they are outsourcing their individual responsibility to her. But a fundamental insight into Thunberg’s existence has already been provided by the previous half-hour of questions about her advocacy of “annual, drastic, immediate emissions cuts, on a scale unlike anything the world has ever seen”. Thunberg has sacrificed her youth to tackle the climate emergency, having realised that it demands a radical reimagining of our whole way of life. Now she is doomed to the pure hell of arguing with people who cannot conceive of that way of life changing. Rajan, who asserts in his introduction that Thunberg’s influence must be acknowledged “whether you admire her or despair of her”, spends large parts of the interview reflecting mainstream discourse on climate – which is to say, he risks sounding ignorant in order to give commonplace gotchas and canards an airing. The sport is in how efficiently Thunberg can knock down questions we should, by now, have moved beyond asking. Early on, she is pressed for an opinion on nuclear power and shale gas. Aren’t they important components of a strategy to hit net zero by 2050, as per the Paris Agreement? Thunberg does say that the former is too slow and the latter is, er, a fossil fuel and thus not a cracking idea, but stresses that her concern is driving awareness of the extent of the problem, not getting bogged down in hot-button issues: arguments about which bucket of water to use will dissipate once people agree that the house is on fire. Unskewing our priorities is also the rejoinder to Rajan’s question, steeped in conservative attitudes towards which expenditures are inevitable and which must be interrogated, about how we would “pay for” free public transport, a key Thunberg objective, during a “cost of living crisis”. Thunberg is presented with several versions of the same argument: we can’t do that, because it would cost money or be inconvenient in the short term. At a time when both main UK political parties have recently used the slogan “growth, growth, growth”, Thunberg’s contention that the endless pursuit of economic expansion might just be, you know, suicidal feels like listening to an intelligent alien who is beamed down to sort us out. Rajan’s question on the topic is remarkable: “Economic growth creates leisure time, it creates opportunities for new experiences – some of which will have a negative impact on the environment, but a lot of which people really enjoy. Flying is one of those … do you think flying should be illegal?” More credibly, Rajan asks how Thunberg can call capitalism a failed ideology, when life expectancy and infant survival rates in China and India have risen as those countries have commercialised. Delicately, Thunberg observes that the collapse of life-support systems, wars for resources and other likely effects of out-of-control global warming might soon cause those graphs to slope back down. It’s not all such a struggle. Thunberg often has a refreshingly unguarded response to daft statements: her reaction to Rajan sincerely intoning that “There is one individual looming over this debate – and that’s Elon Musk” is untrammelled giggling. And, in this extended format, Rajan has time to include more profound questions. An inquiry about whether the gap between what we’re doing and what we need to do is widening (yes) is valuable, as is a discussion about whether Thunberg ought not to encourage blanket cynicism towards politicians, and should consider going into politics herself. She counters that although politicians will ultimately implement the required action, public opinion will be what compels them to act, and protest is an effective way of amplifying that consensus. The politicians themselves then become irrelevant, and we can “reconsider what is politically possible” – the payment of reparations to poorer countries deeply affected by a changing climate they have done little to cause, to take the example Rajan puts forward of a demand that is absurdly unrealistic, might well become feasible. Her main point is that this needs to happen soon. We are desperately short of time, and Thunberg has given herself the task of communicating that urgency. As this programme shows, it is a terribly difficult job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/apr/25/poland-change-europe-high-achievers-country","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-25T12:36:17Z","webTitle":"Poland has changed beyond recognition – and so has its place in Europe's pecking order | Anna Gromada","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/poland-change-europe-high-achievers-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/poland-change-europe-high-achievers-country","fields":{"headline":"Poland has changed beyond recognition – and so has its place in Europe’s pecking order","bodyText":"When the iron curtain was swept away on that miraculous night of 9 November 1989, it exposed some of the deepest differences between geographical neighbours the world has ever recorded. The 13:1 GDP per capita gap between Poland and soon-to-be united Germany was twice that between the US and Mexico. That same night, my pregnant mother and her brothers were workers in the shadow economy on an eco-farm near Frankfurt, helping to meet the needs of a newly minted class of environmentally aware Germans. My family admired that country where “you never got lost on a highway”. People in Germany drove immaculately clean cars and manual labourers could play Stille Nacht on several instruments – which they did at the farm for Christmas 1989 – leading my mother to marvel at an education system that could so universally equip people not just with marketable skills but also with an ingrained sense of beauty. Neighbouring countries tend to have comparable levels of development. A common security context, investment spillovers, migration, remittances and regional supply chains create geographical pockets of welfare or poverty that transcend borders on the map. It takes a solid physical barrier – the Himalayas between China and Nepal for instance, the barbed wire that runs along the Korean border, or the Berlin Wall – to maintain economic chasms such as those that existed between the Poland and Germany of my mother’s era. But eastern Europe’s economic prospects were rapidly revived by the economic integration that took off in Europe in the 1990s. Reunified Germany wanted to have something akin to “the west” in its immediate eastern neighbourhood even if this required a degree of political heavy-lifting elsewhere in the EU. France was much less keen on adopting post-communist orphans in a united Europe. Like China in the 1990s, eastern Europe embarked on its capitalist journey as a simple subcontractor. Ready parts would be parachuted in like sealed Lego sets to be assembled by a cheap and docile workforce that simply followed the instructions before exporting the completed products with low added value to richer countries. At this stage, the low cost of labour drove foreign investment. From 1992 to 2014, wages in Poland slid from 63% of GDP – the level of today’s unionised Germany – to 46%, second lowest in the EU. Car factories in Germany paid workers €3,122 a month, almost four times as much as their Polish, Czech, Slovak or Hungarian colleagues, who made €835 for similar work. “We built capitalism without capital,” Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, who was Poland’s prime minister in 1991, told me a quarter of a century later – when I questioned what appeared to my generation to be an economic model based willingly on semi-dependency. It replaced a communist-era coerced economic dependency on the east – courtesy of Soviet tanks. In the early 2000s, about to join the ranks of EU citizens, my greatest personal hope was for a world-class education. I was trying to learn more languages, cracking my head against German grammar from the aptly named textbook Deutsch – deine Chance (German – Your Chance). Polish eco-farm workers were just hoping to move out of the shadows and into the legal, tax-paying economy. But the farm in Germany, devoted to environmental ethics, showed less commitment to its human equivalent. The illegal workers were pulling double shifts on little sleep, with inadequate health and safety protection on machines operated 24/7. One of those machines fatally injured my uncle. The employer offered to pay to have the coffin taken back to Poland. We, his family, offered to forget about the case. Back then, we assumed this was an acceptable deal. Maybe it was because we preserved some of the thought patterns that had served us well in the past. We clung to them until our operating system got an update. For eastern Europe, the 2004 accession to the EU came as a long-awaited escape from the trap of history. It opened a cashflow for governments, freedom of movement and a vast labour market for workers, and elite universities for overeager girls like me. Others benefited even more. Between 2010 and 2016, Poland received 2.7% of GDP as EU transfers annually, and sent 4.7% as profits to western investors. The gaps were even larger for smaller countries: 2% to 7.5% for the Czech Republic, and 4% to 7.2% for Hungary. From 2004, Poland’s and Germany’s economic cycles intimately aligned, as if in a compatible but unequal marriage. This paid off during the 2008 financial crash: Poland remained an island of growth in a sea of continental recession – largely because Germany, its main contractor, weathered the storm. Germany is almost as important to Poland as the next six of its trade partners put together. Fully 28% of Poland’s exports go to Germany. Less than 6% of German exports go to Poland. My private misgivings about our treatment didn’t germinate until the next decade, by which time I was a poster child for western integration after an educational grand tour through Oxbridge, the Ivy League and grande école. It was 2014 and I was sitting in my best friend’s dorm in Geneva, surrounded by human rights adepts, when this very upper-middle-class question popped into my head: why hadn’t we sued that eco-farm owner back then for such a preventable accident? This question foreshadowed the emergence of a newly entitled ego which regarded the law as a legitimate tool in its playbook, and ahistorically flagellated its past self for not considering what now appeared obvious. Like my sense of entitlement, my country has changed beyond recognition. Poland has experienced uninterrupted growth over three decades, the longest in European history. Its GDP has increased tenfold nominally, sixfold when corrected for the cost of living. It has a record low unemployment rate of 3%, lower infant mortality than Canada, higher female life expectancy than the US and less violent crime than the UK . And now you don’t get lost on Polish highways either. The change is symbolised by, guess what, the car industry. It turned out that eastern Europe did not after all have to be just the assembly line: it could do without the Lego sets. Poland, and others, started clambering up the value chain. Our factories were soon producing high-quality components on the spot rather than importing them from somewhere in Bavaria or Hessen. Poland began to export not just finished cars, but engines, then electric car batteries. The country’s organic move up the supply chain, gave rise to a question: if we have all the human and technical components for car production, why don’t we do it ourselves? This question was a real-world illustration of what theorists such as Joseph Schumpeter said happens in globalised capitalism when technological progress overtakes and destroys established industrial monopolies (such as those of western Europe) turning them into the dinosaurs and giving newcomers (such as eastern Europe) a chance to sneak in. In 2004, joining the EU meant higher standards of living, unprecedented economic growth and life chances. For years, it also meant accepting an inbuilt bias in rule-making towards the old-timers: France and Germany. The EU-funded highway system in Poland for example, primarily developed the west-east axis, promoting German trade and North Sea ports, rather than the north-south axis which would boost Poland as an eastern European trade hub along with its Baltic ports. When Poland became a leader in European road haulage services, Germany pushed for common EU rules for truck drivers which harmed the competitiveness of Polish transport companies which employ half a million workers and account for 6% of GDP. To many in Poland, the reform looked like a selective application of rules in the service of richer countries. But the balance of power is steadily shifting in ways that some may find uncomfortable. The last few years have been marked by political and economic ruptures in the Poland-Germany relationship. Politically, the feeling that Germany failed to take Ukraine’s sovereignty seriously – until its own supply of Russian gas was threatened – has provoked angst throughout the region. What if, one day, they don’t take our sovereignty seriously either? Economically, the surface current still looks like the old model of Polish subcontracting, relatively cheaper labour and a slow clamber up the value chain. But it masks undertows of a new economic relationship in which Germany faces competition from its eastern back yard. A Polish-Finnish firm recently launched pioneering satellites with cloud-penetrating technology. The US army has just procured 10,000 Polish Manpad missiles (man-portable air-defence systems) after they proved more effective than American Stingers. The Polish army sourced nanosatellites newly invented by a local company. Some Polish start-ups, such as molecular diagnostics firms, are being sold for hundreds of millions of dollars. And the Polish electric car Izera will hit the market in 2026 with plans to produce 60% of components locally. No wonder that, although it does so with velvet gloves, Germany uses its EU muscle to try to impede Polish strategic infrastructural investments such as new nuclear power plants, inland waterways and the development of a container port in Szczecin-Świnoujscie – an obvious competitive threat to German ports. Globally and locally, economic cooperation based on a centre-periphery division of labour is being challenged. When your assembly line grows in power, it starts coming up with its own Lego sets. China-US rivalry may soon be echoed in regional (and friendlier) miniatures, such as a Polish-German divide. As eastern Europe grows in power, it is questioning its role in the pecking order. The region has learned the hard way that if you are not at the negotiating table, you are on the menu.

Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, 27, are both US military veterans who had been living in Alabama and went to Ukraine to assist with war efforts. Relatives have been in contact with Senate and House offices seeking information on the men’s whereabouts. The pair haven’t been heard from in days, members of the state’s congressional delegation have said. Captive Americans would add another layer of complexity to efforts by the US, which is pumping billions of dollars into Ukraine but trying to steer clear of direct confrontation with Russia. If confirmed, they would be the first Americans fighting for Ukraine known to have been captured since the war began in February. Drueke’s mother reached out earlier this week, said Terri Sewell, her local congresswoman. “According to his family, they have not heard from Drueke in several days,” Sewell said in a statement. “We will continue to do everything in our power to assist in locating him and finding answers for his family.” White House spokesman John Kirby said he could not confirm the disappearance of the two Americans but said, “If it’s true, we’ll do everything we can to get them safely back home.” He said that the US discouraged Americans from traveling to Ukraine, which has endured a nearly four-month war against invading Russian forces. “It is a war zone. It is combat. And if you feel passionate about supporting Ukraine, there’s any number of other ways to do that that are safer and just as effective,” Kirby told reporters. The Telegraph, which first reported their disappearances, quoted an unnamed fellow fighter who said the two men were captured after running into a larger Russian force during a 9 June battle north-east of Kharkiv. Drueke’s mother, Lois Drueke, said her son told his family that he was teaching Ukrainian troops how to use US-made weapons. “Alex felt very strongly that he had been trained in ways that he could help the Ukrainians be strong and push Putin back,” she told the Washington Post, referring to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Two British nationals have been reported killed in the fighting and another two Britons are facing the death penalty after being captured and convicted as mercenaries by a pro-Russian court. Joe Biden earlier Wednesday announced another $1bn in military aid to Ukraine but has said that US forces will not directly engage Russia, a fellow nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jan/31/armed-counter-terrorism-officers-british-cross-channel-ferries-security","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-31T10:14:11Z","webTitle":"Armed counter-terrorism officers to be deployed on British cross-Channel ferries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/31/armed-counter-terrorism-officers-british-cross-channel-ferries-security","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/jan/31/armed-counter-terrorism-officers-british-cross-channel-ferries-security","fields":{"headline":"Armed counter-terrorism officers to be deployed on British cross-Channel ferries","bodyText":"Armed counter-terrorism officers will be deployed on British cross-Channel ferries for the first time this summer, though government sources said there was no specific threat to passenger vessels. Firearms police from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) are to be posted on ferries out of Dover, as well as on passenger ships between Newcastle and the Netherlands. The move will tighten security on British ferries, which are unguarded and seen as vulnerable, with passengers not individually searched or given body scans when boarding, unlike those on planes or Eurostar trains. A government spokesperson said: “The government will always take the strongest possible action to protect our national security and our priority remains maintaining the safety and security of our citizens. “We are constantly developing protection for UK citizens against the threat of terrorism. This includes strengthening security by fully equipping law enforcement and emergency responders to respond to terrorist incidents, no matter where they occur.” It is understood about 40 CNC officers will be posted on a rotation basis on ferries with a trial starting in July. The CNC has officers available as a result of nuclear power stations being decommissioned. A senior counter-terrorism source told the Times that ferries were seen as extremely vulnerable and “completely unguarded”. “Ferries are the weak link when it comes to policing transport against terror attacks. Moving a handful of CNC officers to ferries makes sense and they will be a visible deterrent,” the source said. A government source confirmed to the Guardian there was “no specific threat to passenger vessels” and the treaty and other cooperation with France formed part of the UK government’s wider strategy to ensure it was able to protect UK citizens against terrorism “no matter where it occurs”. With the decommissioning of nuclear power stations, the number of officers required to protect them is falling. The decision to redeploy CNC officers is part of a plan to extend the force’s remit to enable them to offer services beyond the civil nuclear sector and provide support to other police forces. A UK-France maritime security treaty was signed in July to improve joint working. It will come into force once the UK and France have completed ratification procedures and is designed to mitigate against a high-threat security incident on a ferry or other large vessel in the Channel. The treaty includes provisions that would enable the UK and France to share security information concerning potential threats, mount swifter and stronger initial responses to serious security incidents, coordinate more efficient joint responses and cooperate more effectively in the aftermath of an attack or incident, a spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/08/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-197-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T00:33:25Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 197 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/08/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-197-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/08/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-197-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 197 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine has recaptured several settlements in the north-eastern Kharkiv region as part of a surprise counterattack, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed. “This week we have good news from Kharkiv region,” he said in his Wednesday evening address, adding that “now is not the right time to name those settlements where the Ukrainian flag has returned”. An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. US intelligence says Ukrainian forces are making “slow but meaningful progress” on the battlefield. “We’ll see how things pan out,” defence undersecretary Colin Kahl said. “But I certainly think things are going better on the Ukrainian side right now in the south than is true on the Russian side.” The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based thinktank, reported on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces probably captured Verbivka, less than two miles (3.2km) north-west of Balakliia, on Tuesday, citing geo-locatable images posted by Ukrainian soldiers. Shelling resumed near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Wednesday. Ukrainian officials accused Russian forces of firing on the city of Nikopol, across from the plant, as well as in Enerhodar, where the power plant is located. “Employees of communal and other services simply do not have time to complete emergency and restoration work, as another shelling reduces their work to zero,” the Ukrainian mayor of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, said on Telegram. The UN has accused Moscow of forcing Ukrainians into detention camps and even prisons via a Kremlin-directed “filtration” program, and removing children from the war zone to hand over to adoptive parents inside Russia. “We are concerned that the Russian authorities have adopted a simplified procedure to grant Russian citizenship to children without parental care, and that these children would be eligible for adoption by Russian families,” Ilze Brands Kehris, assistant UN secretary-general for human rights, told the security council. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the council that estimates indicate authorities have “interrogated, detained, and forcibly deported” between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainians to Russia since late February in an attempt “to prepare for an attempted annexation”. The body of a British aid worker who was captured by Russian proxies in April has been handed to Ukraine with “possible signs of unspeakable torture”, according to the country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. Paul Urey, 45, from Warrington, Cheshire, was captured along with another Briton, Dylan Healey. The two men were charged with “mercenary activities” by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, but in July the Russian proxy authorities announced that Urey had died as a result of “illness and stress”. Kuleba said Urey’s body had been returned, showing possible signs of torture. Vladimir Putin has threatened to tear up a fragile Ukraine grain deal allowing exports from the Black Sea. During a bellicose speech at an economic conference in Vladivostok, Putin said he would speak with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, about “limiting the destinations for grain exports”, claiming that only two of 87 ships leaving Ukraine with grain had gone to developing countries. Data from the UN showed the claim was false by a factor of at least 10. Putin also threatened to cut off all deliveries of gas, oil, and coal to Europe if they imposed a price cap on Russian energy imports. “Will there be any political decisions that contradict the contracts? Yes, we just won’t fulfil them. We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests,” he said, according to a Reuters translation of his remarks. “We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil – we will not supply anything.” Recalling a Russian fairytale, he said that Europeans could “freeze like the wolf’s tail”. Putin declared that Russia had “lost nothing” in launching a war on Ukraine during a belligerent and defiant speech at the Russian Eastern Economic Forum on Wednesday. “We haven’t lost anything and we won’t lose anything,” he said, when asked about the cost of the invasion. “The main gain is the strengthening of our sovereignty.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/mar/27/boris-johnson-to-confront-bitter-tory-splits-over-uk-energy-strategy-and-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-27T08:15:20Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson to confront bitter Tory splits over UK energy strategy and bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/27/boris-johnson-to-confront-bitter-tory-splits-over-uk-energy-strategy-and-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/mar/27/boris-johnson-to-confront-bitter-tory-splits-over-uk-energy-strategy-and-bills","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson to confront bitter Tory splits over UK energy strategy and bills","bodyText":"Boris Johnson is expected to hold crunch talks with senior cabinet ministers this week to resolve fractious talks over plans to tackle rising bills and boost the country’s energy security. The government’s energy strategy has been delayed by cabinet splits over onshore wind, funding for nuclear energy and the role fracking should play given spiralling energy prices and the Ukraine invasion. It is understood that major disagreements still remain between the prime minister, chancellor Rishi Sunak and Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary. The cabinet tensions have only grown since the chancellor’s spring statement last week, which drew criticism for failing to do enough on the cost of living. Sunak now faces pressure from Number 10 to sanction spending on new nuclear power and renewables projects. Kwarteng’s department is said to be keen on schemes that would boost onshore wind by giving energy bill discounts for those who live near turbines – a scheme that has been run successfully by Octopus Energy. The prime minister is also said to favour accelerating the creation of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) produced by Rolls-Royce, but Sunak has been warning about the long-term costs involved in a big expansion of nuclear power. Voters now regard energy as the second most important issue facing the UK, even ahead of the economy. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer found that 48% of voters flagged it as an important issue, up 17 points from a month ago. Only health and the NHS are greater concerns. The disputes are rumbling on alongside concerns that some of the help already offered by the chancellor on household bills will not reach vulnerable households. The Observer has been told that more than a million households are set to miss out on one of the main measures. An official assessment of its much-vaunted £150 council tax rebate predicted that 1.3m households won’t receive it. In its assessment of the spring statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted that a fifth of those who did not pay their council tax by direct debit would not take up the rebate, thereby saving the exchequer £195m. Local councils warned they had not been given the resources to deliver the rebate. The most vulnerable households are more likely to be among those who do not receive the tax cut automatically. The government has said it is the job of local councils to ensure that those who do not receive the rebate automatically do not miss out. However, the Observer has seen pleas from councils to ministers that they have not been given the resources to help them ensure no one misses out. One council leader said distributing the rebate would cost it “in the region of £450,000, with no government funding to assist”. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said: “It is staggering that more than a million families are set to miss out because of this Conservative government’s half-baked plans. Often those who don’t pay council tax by direct debit are older and more deprived, meaning some of these households are likely to be among the most vulnerable in the country. “People are facing sky-rocketing bills and plummeting living standards, but it looks like even the meagre support on offer from the Conservatives won’t reach those who need it most. Rishi Sunak must confirm that anyone who misses out on the rebate will get their £150 cheque in the post. No one should go without the help they need because of this Conservative government’s incompetence.” A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “Direct debit is the quickest and easiest way to pay council tax, and the best way for most people to get the rebate. Councils are responsible for making sure eligible households who don’t pay their council tax by direct debit receive the rebate and we have suggested a range of payment options. With the support of councils, we are confident that all those eligible for a rebate will receive their payments in good time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/27/james-lovelock-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T15:54:11Z","webTitle":"James Lovelock obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/27/james-lovelock-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/27/james-lovelock-obituary","fields":{"headline":"James Lovelock obituary","bodyText":"The scientist James Lovelock’s discoveries had an immense influence on our understanding of the global impact of humankind, and on the search for extraterrestrial life. A vigorous writer and speaker, he became a hero to the green movement, although he was one of its most formidable critics. His research highlighted some of the issues that became the most intense environmental concerns of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, among them the insidious spread through the living world of industrial pollutants; the destruction of the ozone layer; and the potential menace of global heating. He supported nuclear power and defended the chemical industries – and his warnings took an increasingly apocalyptic note. “The planet we live on has merely to shrug to take some fraction of a million people to their deaths,” Lovelock wrote in 2006. “But this is nothing compared with what may soon happen; we are now so abusing the Earth that it may rise and move back into the hot state it was in 55m years ago, and if it does, most of us, and our descendants, will die.” In a speech to the Royal Society, he described the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as “the scariest official document I have ever read”. Lovelock, who has died on his 103rd birthday, was best known through the Gaia theory, a controversial idea that he proposed in the 1960s and developed with the US biologist Lynn Margulis in the 70s. They suggested a radically different way of looking at the evolution of life. Their proposition challenged the view of Earth as just a lump of rock, a passive host to millions of species of plants and animals that simply adapted to their environment. Gaia held that those countless millions of organisms not only competed, but also cooperated to maintain an environment in which life could be sustained: a process of co-evolution. It was a conjecture that jarred with many scholars, such as Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary biologist, who regarded the notion as a profound heresy against Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection anchored in the thesis of survival of the fittest. Gaia was an instant inspiration for the green movement; but it took years to get overt recognition from the scientific establishment. That came in 1988 when the American Geophysical Union held a meeting in San Diego, California, that drew leading physicists, biologists and climatologists to weigh the evidence for Gaia and debate its implications for the future of science. In 2001, more than 1,000 scientists met in Amsterdam to declare that the planet “behaves as a single self-regulating system comprised of physical, chemical, biological and human components”. In effect, Lovelock and Margulis had won the day: the details could be debated, but the broad argument was settled. Early in his career, Lovelock devised techniques to freeze and then re-animate cell tissue, and even whole animals such as hamsters. Just for fun, in 1954, he used microwave radiation from a continuous wave magnetron to cook a potato. “It may have been the first working microwave oven used to cook food that was then eaten,” he wrote. “If it was, then I did invent it.” He worked with the actors Leo McKern and Joan Greenwood on a BBC drama, The Critical Point (1957), about the experimental freezing of a human, and used a home-made electronic sound generator to simulate the failing breath, the fading heartbeat and the death rattle of an actor. He was later told that his tape inspired the BBC to found its pioneering radiophonic workshop. He designed new types of extraordinarily sensitive instruments that could detect the presence of unimaginably tiny concentrations of man-made chemicals in gases. When they were used to study the chemistry of the atmosphere they pointed the finger at the spread of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as the source of destruction of the ozone layer. Similarly, they revealed the accumulation of residues of pesticides in the tissues of virtually all living creatures, from penguins in Antarctica to mothers’ milk in Europe and the US. Throughout his life he went on delivering inventive ideas. With Chris Rapley, then director of the Science Museum in London, Lovelock proposed in the journal Nature in 2007 a way by which humans could churn the world’s oceans to stimulate algal growth, draw down extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, increase the formation of sunlight-reflecting clouds and thus damp down global heating. Lovelock was born in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, but was brought up in Brixton, south London, where his parents, Tom and Nellie, ran a shop selling picture frames. He was educated at the local grammar, the Strand school. At an early age, he discovered the public library, which he said fired a fascination with science. By comparison, he found science lessons at school dull. In the unfettered freedom of the library, he soaked up information with equal relish from science fiction or any science textbook that caught his interest, on astronomy, natural history, biology, physics and chemistry. Lovelock’s practical flair was also given free rein. He recalled inventing a gadget as a schoolboy, an airspeed indicator that he held out of the window during train journeys. His parents could not support their son at university, so Lovelock got a job as a laboratory technician in industry, and studied for a BSc at evening classes. In 1940 he joined the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, where he stayed for 20 years. Then a Quaker, he was a conscientious objector during the second world war. While at the NIMR, he took a PhD in biomedical science and made the most important of his inventions, the electron capture detector. It was a matchbox size device that could detect and measure tiny traces of toxic chemicals. Like many great inventors Lovelock was not really a team player. He craved independence. The electron capture detector earned him enough money to get that freedom, and in later years he liked to describe himself as an “independent scientist since 1964”. “Any artist or novelist would understand,” he wrote in his autobiography, Homage to Gaia (2000), “some of us do not produce their best when directed.” Lovelock’s transition to independence began when he left the NIMR in 1961 to work for Nasa, the US space agency. He was invited to design experiments for the Surveyor series of unmanned spacecraft that were to examine the surface of the moon before the US government would authorise a lunar landing attempt by the Apollo astronauts. He moved from the moon project to work with Nasa’s interplanetary exploration team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California, on ideas for looking for signs of life on Mars. He was surprised at the shortage of suggestions from the universities and research institutes to a request from Nasa for proposals to study the biological aspects of the Red Planet. He attributed the lack of interest to an obsession with molecular biology and genetic evolution triggered by the stunning discovery by Francis Crick and James Watson of how the genetic code was carried by DNA. Lovelock was disappointed in the shift in the focus of research in biology from the big picture to the small. The study of life concentrated more on a closer examination of molecules and atoms rather than on whole organisms, with the implication that the whole was never more than the sum of its parts and scientists could figure out how organisms worked by taking them to pieces. Lovelock’s experiments to look for signs of life on Mars were conceived quite differently, through a holistic approach rather than a reductionist one; and his approach had an important influence in the thinking he and Margulis shared in establishing the principles of the Gaia theory. Nasa plans to look for evidence of extraterrestrial life were targeted initially on Earth’s neighbouring planets, Venus and Mars. Lovelock predicted from a study of the chemical composition of their atmospheres that both Mars and Venus would be lifeless. Then, with a bit of pure lateral thinking, he wondered how Earth might appear to an extraterrestrial intelligence. He pursued the idea in a conversation with Dian Hitchcock, a colleague at JPL, about why there were such extreme differences between the atmosphere of Earth and those of Mars and Venus. He said the conclusion he reached was probably the moment Gaia was born. The atmospheres of both Mars and Venus comprised over 95% carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and other gases. In contrast, the Earth’s atmosphere was 77% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with traces of carbon dioxide and other gases. He looked for an explanation as to what made the Earth’s atmosphere so different, and unique in our solar system. The evidence that the sun’s energy had increased 30% during the three and a half billion years life had existed on the planet, and yet the Earth’s surface temperature had remained constant, particularly puzzled him. Lovelock reckoned that, according to standard physics, the planet’s surface should have boiled with the increasing heat, rather than remain cool. The only explanation, he decided, was that the Earth was a self-regulating system that had found a way to preserve its equilibrium: and that the organisms on Earth had kept their environment stable. He reasoned that the Earth’s atmosphere was a continually changing balance of gases because of its living and breathing inhabitants, while the Martian atmosphere was static. The regulatory mechanism began when the earliest life-forms in the ancient oceans extracted carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and released oxygen back into it. Over vast spans of geological time, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere declined to the present composition to favour the oxygen-dependent organisms. Lovelock and Margulis argued that the biosphere of planet Earth could be considered a self-evolving and self-regulating system that unconsciously and subtly manipulated atmosphere, water and rocks to its own advantage. When he was developing his theory, Lovelock described his ideas to his then friend and neighbour in the Wiltshire village of Bowerchalke, the novelist William Golding, and asked his advice on a suitable name. Golding suggested Gaia, after the Greek goddess who drew the living world forth from Chaos. As an illustration of the Gaia theory, Lovelock invented the Daisyworld model of coevolution. Daisyworld involved a field of black and white daisies. If the temperature rose, the black flowers absorbed more heat than the white ones, and withered. The white daisies proliferated. Eventually, the white daisies reflected more heat back into space, cooling the planet down again and allowed the black daisies to re-emerge. Although Gaia exerted a great influence on the green movement, Lovelock had, by his own admission, “never been wholly on the side of environmentalism”. He acted as a consultant to corporate groups such as Hewlett-Packard and Shell, and in Homage to Gaia wrote: “Too many greens are not just ignorant of science, they hate science.” He likened them to “some global over-anxious mother figure who is so concerned about small risks that she ignores the real dangers”. He wished they “would grow up” and focus on the real problem: “How can we feed, house and clothe the abundant human race without destroying the habitats of other creatures?” Unlike most environmentalists, Lovelock favoured nuclear energy. “Some time in the next century, when the adverse effects of climate change begin to bite, people will look back in anger at those who now so foolishly continue to pollute by burning fossil fuel instead of accepting the beneficence of nuclear power. Is our distrust of nuclear power and genetically modified food soundly based?” he asked. He filed more than 40 patents, and wrote more than 200 scientific papers, as well as several books on the Gaia theory. He was awarded scientific medals, and showered with international prizes and honorary doctorates by British and other universities. From his first book, Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth (1979), to his last, published when he was 99, Lovelock wrote elegantly and persuasively. He remained an optimist. In Novacene: The Coming Age of Hyperintelligence (2019), he delivered what he called “a shout of joy” for the colossal expansion of human knowledge during his lifetime, and hoped for the potential salvation of humanity by a new generation of artificially intelligent cyborgs that would – unlike many of his fellow humans – understand the importance of other living things in maintaining a habitable planet. In 1977, Lovelock and his wife Helen – already ill with multiple sclerosis – moved from Bowerchalke to Coombe Mill, near the Devon/Cornwall border, which grew into a 35-acre woodland experimental farm. In later years he lived in Abbotsbury, near the Dorset coast. Helen (nee Hyslop), whom he had married in 1942, died in 1989. His second wife, Sandy (nee Orchard), whom he married in 1991, survives him, along with two sons, Andrew and John, and two daughters, Jane and Christine, from his first marriage. • James Ephraim Lovelock, chemist, biomedical scientist and inventor, born 26 July 1919; died 26 July 2022 • Pearce Wright died in 2005"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/jan/21/global-nuclear-weapons-ban-begins-without-the-worlds-nuclear-powers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-01-21T22:00:30Z","webTitle":"Global nuclear weapons ban begins - without the world's nuclear powers signing up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/21/global-nuclear-weapons-ban-begins-without-the-worlds-nuclear-powers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jan/21/global-nuclear-weapons-ban-begins-without-the-worlds-nuclear-powers","fields":{"headline":"Global nuclear weapons ban begins – without the world's nuclear powers","bodyText":"An international treaty banning all nuclear weapons that has been ratified by 51 countries and that campaigners hope will help raise the profile of global deterrence efforts comes into force on Friday. Although in some respects the step is largely symbolic because the world’s nuclear powers have not signed up, the treaty will be legally binding on the smaller nations that have endorsed it, and it is backed by the UN leadership. The treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons (TPNW) outlaws the creation, ownership and deployment of nuclear weapons by signatory states and places obligations on them to assist other victims of nuclear weapons use and testing. Britain’s Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has released polling saying that 59% of the UK public support the country signing up to the TPNW and that 77% support a “total ban on all nuclear weapons globally”. Kate Hudson, CND’s general secretary, called on the UK government “to cease its intransigence and engage constructively with the new treaty”, arguing that the polling showed this position would command popular support. But there is no prospect of the world’s leading nuclear powers endorsing it. Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of Nato, said in November the treaty disregarded the realities of global security. “Giving up our deterrent without any guarantees that others will do the same is a dangerous option,” he said. “A world where Russia, China, North Korea and others have nuclear weapons, but Nato does not, is not a safer world.” Recent years have seen a gradual erosion of global nuclear controls, with the 1987 intermediate nuclear forces (INF) treaty, which kept nuclear missiles off European soil, allowed to expire in 2019 amid mutual recriminations from Russia and the US. The new strategic arms reduction treaty between the US and Russia, which limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, is due to expire on 5 February – although Nato is calling on both sides to extend it following this week’s inauguration of Joe Biden as American president. The TPNW emerged following the creation of a UN working group in 2016. It was supported by 123 countries, with 38 voting against. The US, UK, France and Russia were all opposed, as was Israel, which is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons. China, India and Pakistan abstained. Countries that have ratified the agreement include Nigeria, Malaysia, Ireland, Malta, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Vietnam and the Vatican City – although last autumn the US made a last-ditch lobbying attempt to try to convince countries to rescind their signatures. That effort failed, and in October Honduras became the 50th country to sign the document, which meant that it would gain legal force after a 90-day period. Rebecca Johnson, a veteran disarmament campaigner and a leading figure behind the development of the treaty, said: “This is an example of UN multilateralism in action. Britain needs to be at the table, taking the next steps towards ridding the world of nuclear weapons.” The Foreign Office said the UK was “committed to the long-term goal of a world without nuclear weapons”. A spokesperson added: “We firmly believe the best way to achieve this is through gradual multilateral disarmament.” • This article was amended on 27 January 2021 to clarify that 51 countries have ratified the treaty, rather than signed it as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/jun/14/cbi-boss-says-world-is-way-off-track-in-fight-against-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-14T06:02:45Z","webTitle":"CBI boss says world is ‘way off track’ in fight against climate crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/14/cbi-boss-says-world-is-way-off-track-in-fight-against-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/jun/14/cbi-boss-says-world-is-way-off-track-in-fight-against-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"CBI boss says world is ‘way off track’ in fight against climate crisis","bodyText":"The head of the UK’s biggest business lobby group has warned that the corporate world is “way off track” in tackling the climate crisis. Tony Danker, the director general of the CBI, called on the government to do more to unlock the resources of the private sector by publishing new guidance on heating and transport. “Tackling the planet’s climate crisis before it’s too late has always been a seismic challenge demanding global cooperation on an unprecedented scale,” he will say in a speech at the CBI’s Road to Zero conference on Monday. “The world has no room for failure. The climate crisis is worsening and currently we’re way off track.” The CBI, which represents the UK’s biggest employers, wants the government to “fill in the blanks” in its plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 68% by the end of this decade, and by 78% compared with 1990 levels by 2035. Danker called for the government to put forward detailed plans on a charging network for electric vehicles, the phasing out of gas boilers, new offshore windfarms, and funding formulas for new nuclear power stations. Last year, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced a much-heralded “10-point plan” for a green industrial revolution, but few of the aspirations it contained came with any concrete policies attached. Danker told the Guardian: “I think the 10-point plan is very good, but it does not have quite enough detail. We need a blueprint to build, to make sure we move from ambition to action.” Without such detail and policies, the UK would miss out on much-needed investment from international companies, he warned. “Companies are alert and keen to play in Britain, but they are now saying they need more granularity [detail] to make real investment decisions,” he said. The UK will host vital UN climate talks, called Cop26, in Glasgow this November to attempt to put the world on track to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, of limiting global heating to well below 2C and preferably less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The CBI is holding a conference on the long-term goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The organisation has set out its recommendations on achieving the targets, which include seven new gigafactories to build batteries and other components for electric vehicles, a plan for a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging and a review into fuel duty by the end of this year. A new strategy to decarbonise homes should include a requirement for new gas boilers sold after 2025 to be “hydrogen ready”, and no new gas boilers should be sold from 2035. He said the government should learn from the failure of its green homes grant scheme, which was intended to insulate tens of thousands of homes but was scrapped after six months amid widespread complaints from consumers. “It’s OK to get the execution wrong, but you can’t scrap the intention – they need to come back with a better plan,” he said. Danker stopped short of recommending a halt to airport expansion, which campaigners have called for, saying instead that the government should pour more effort into “jet zero” plans for low-carbon flying using fuels and technology that have yet to be developed. The UK government said: “The UK is a world leader in the global effort to tackle climate change. We were the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to climate change by 2050, and have just committed to a highly ambitious climate target to cut emissions by 78% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels. “We are powering forward with the prime minister’s 10-point plan, which will mobilise £12bn of government investment to create and support up to 250,000 highly skilled green jobs in the UK, and attract over three times as much private sector investment by 2030.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/12/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-170-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T00:52:42Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 170 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/12/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-170-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/12/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-170-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 170 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told officials to stop talking to reporters about Kyiv’s military tactics against Russia, saying such remarks were “frankly irresponsible”. The president’s comments come after news organisations cited unidentified officials saying Ukrainian forces were responsible for blasts that destroyed a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, despite Kyiv declining to say whether it was behind the explosions. The devastation at the Russian air base in Crimea suggests Kyiv may have obtained new long-range strike capability with potential to change the course of the war. The base is well beyond the range of advanced rockets that western countries acknowledge sending to Ukraine so far, with some western military experts saying the scale of the damage and the apparent precision of the strike suggested a powerful new capability with potentially important implications. The UN has urged a demilitarised zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as Russia and Ukraine trade accusations over more shelling of the plant on Thursday. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company said it had been shelled five times by Russian forces on Thursday, resulting in staff being unable to change shifts. However, Russian news agency Tass reported that the local Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Zaporizhzhia said the plant had been fired upon by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s Energoatom agency said the plant was operating normally. The United States supports calls for a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia plant after fighting involving Russian and Ukrainian forces in the vicinity of the plant, a State Department spokesperson said on Thursday. “Fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous and irresponsible and we continue to call on Russia to cease all military operations at or near Ukrainian nuclear facilities and return full control to Ukraine, and support Ukrainian calls for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear power plant,” the spokesperson said. The British defence secretary has said Vladimir Putin is now unlikely to succeed in occupying Ukraine. Ben Wallace said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “faltered” and was “starting to fail”, as he pledged more financial and military support to the eastern European nation’s defence. Russia has doubled the number of air strikes on Ukraine’s military positions and civilian infrastructure compared with the previous week, Ukrainian Brigadier General Oleksiy Hromov said on Thursday. “The enemy’s planes and helicopters avoid flying into the range of our air defences, and therefore the accuracy of these strikes is low,” he told a news conference. Ukraine aims to evacuate two thirds of residents from areas it controls in the eastern battleground region of Donetsk before winter, partly out of concern people won’t be able to stay warm amid war-damaged infrastructure, the deputy prime minister said on Thursday. The government plans to evacuate some 220,000 people out of around 350,000, including 52,000 children, Iryna Vereshchuk told a news conference. Ukraine expects a ship to arrive on Friday to load grain for delivery to Ethiopia under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, Reuters reports. Ukraine expects $3bn of US financial aid to arrive in August and a further $1.5bn in September, its finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, said on Thursday. Marchenko said the payments were part of the $7.5bn financial aid package agreed by Ukraine and the US at the start of the summer and would be used to finance “critical spending” such as healthcare and pension costs. Belarus has said that blasts heard overnight at one of its military bases 19 miles from Ukraine were caused by a “technical incident”. At least eight explosions were heard after midnight near Zyabrovka military airport, according to reports on Telegram messenger. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. McDonald’s will start reopening some of its restaurants in Ukraine in the coming months, in a show of support after the American fast-food chain pulled out of Russia. The burger giant closed its Ukrainian restaurants after Russia’s invasion nearly six months ago but has continued to pay more than 10,000 McDonald’s employees in the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/nov/29/try-being-trustworthy-martin-lewiss-advice-to-mps-seeking-to-restore-trust-in-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-29T19:03:22Z","webTitle":"Try being trustworthy!

Martin Lewis’s advice to MPs seeking to restore trust in politics","bodyText":"Here’s a thought. One that should keep some MPs awake at night. Are politicians intrinsically untrustworthy? Are only people who are predisposed to being economical with the truth attracted to a career in public life? Or are they a misunderstood bunch? The good guys. Just ordinary men and women who want to make the world a better place. It’s just the nature of the job that forces them into some uneasy compromises with the truth. If so, does a bit of them die each time they trade in half-truths and lies? Are they corroded from the inside till they are little more than a fragile carapace? Or are they born again each day, untainted by the falsehoods of the past? These existential questions were on the minds of the culture select committee as it gathered to take evidence on misinformation from the money-saving expert Martin Lewis, AKA, in many quarters, the most trusted man in Britain. A man who can be guaranteed to tell the truth. “What makes someone a trusted voice?” asked the Scottish National party MP John Nicolson. A man who had good cause to wonder, as he was later to be referred to the privileges committee for the heinous crime of trying to get Nadine Dorries referred to the privileges committee for misleading the select committee by making public his correspondence with the speaker. Go figure. Only in parliament. Lewis didn’t need a moment to think. The key thing was to be inherently trustworthy in the first place. On this bombshell … Trustworthiness wasn’t something that could be created. Or marketed. He’d once been in a meeting where some energy companies had begged David Cameron to help them become more trustworthy. Lewis had interrupted the love-in. He would do anything he could to stop trusting the energy companies, because most of the information they passed on through their call centres was incorrect. And much the same applied to politicians, he continued. The problem was cabinet collective responsibility and the whipping system. Everyone knew that MPs voted for things in which they did not believe to stay onside with their party. So politicians shouldn’t complain when people think they tell lies. Or get too precious if they do defy the party line and act on principle. Take it on the chin. When it comes to the truth, MPs are near the bottom of the food chain. Take Rishi Sunak. All those promises he made during his summer leadership campaign? Forget them. He lost the leadership contest to the deranged Liz Truss so all bets are off. No one should for a minute imagine that he still believes the same things now as he did a few months ago. All he now believes is in a damage limitation campaign to get him through to the next election. At which point he’s toast. Everything is geared to making him not look weak and indecisive. Which is how the whole country sees him. Not even the Tories believe in him any more. Rish! has created a cabinet in his own image. Largely by force majeure. Believe it or not, the current crop of ministers are what passes for competence. Only in the UK would we have a business secretary who in a former life invented pseudonyms to sell a get-rich-quick-scheme. And Grant Shapps wonders why no one takes him seriously. Though – incredibly – he’s seen by Sunak as one of the few safe pairs of hands. Shapps was in the Commons to make a statement on Sizewell C. If you thought this was familiar, you’d be right. The government had already committed to the nuclear power station in the recent budget. But there is so little news to report – partly because there are no plans and partly because, when there is, Tory MPs start objecting – that ministers are now re-announcing old statements. It won’t be long before the transport secretary announces the opening of the M25. Understandably, Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, was underwhelmed. Why had Shapps come over all Shakespearean in his enthusiasm for renewables as he attempted to pad out his statement beyond 30 seconds. Everyone knew Shapps hated onshore wind turbines and Rish! hated solar panels. And the government had done nothing to insulate 19m homes. Shapps – or Green or Fox or whatever he was calling himself today – said the offshore turbines were too big for onshore. Everyone looked blank. Just make the onshore ones a bit smaller. Duh! Still, there was one person to admire and trust in Westminster on Tuesday. Though she wasn’t a politician. She was a politician’s wife. Then Olena Zelenska, Ukraine’s first lady, had never bargained on being a public figure. She had married a comedian and the closest she had expected to get to celebrity was the green room of a TV chatshow. Then Volodymr Zelenskiy had become president. Almost as a joke. And when Russia invaded Ukraine, he had become an unexpected hero. A politician loved and admired by millions inside and outside his country. Zelenska was in London to remind the UK of the war crimes being committed in Ukraine and she spoke to 100 or so MPs and peers – Boris Johnson was demoted to the cheap seats: how are the mighty fallen – in committee room 14. You’d have thought parliament could have found somewhere a little grander than the usual haunt of Tory leadership contests. And she was hugely impressive. Not only because she had a just cause in which she and her audience could believe. But because of her delivery. There was none of the theatrics born of the Oxbridge debating societies so often found in Westminster. Just a quiet, plain delivery. Almost fragile. Not so much a speech. More a prayer. Trust; you’ve either got it or you haven’t.

The government is expected to outline long-awaited proposals this week for a once-in-a-generation drive to invest in nuclear power and possibly more onshore wind and solar power, as well as approving continued North Sea oil and gas exploration. The plan expected to be set out by ministers on Thursday has been delayed amid disagreements in the cabinet about which technologies to back, including a fraught battle over new nuclear power plants, with the Treasury thought to be reluctant to invest large sums in costly projects. One industry source said heavy energy users were “not expecting anything” to help them on gas or electricity, the latter of which can cost up to 60% more than the price paid by European competitors. Earlier this month, Boris Johnson promised measures to “address the needs of British steel, British ceramics and the whole of British industry” but the business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, told MPs last week that the government had already taken steps to support industrial firms facing soaring costs. Against a backdrop of ballooning energy bills for strategically important companies and major manufacturing firms, energy intensive industries told the Guardian that the mixed messages had left them fearing they will receive minimal help, or none at all. Richard Warren, a spokesperson for the trade body UK Steel, said it had “long urged the government to reduce the politically and regulatory controlled elements of electricity bills in line with action taken by governments elsewhere”. Simply renewing a compensation scheme that gives electricity intensive industries a refund on the cost of the UK’s emissions trading scheme, but which expired on Friday, would be only a “partial solution”. UK Steel said the industry “needs full compensation for the costs of carbon in electricity, an increase in the relief on renewables levies, and similar reductions in network costs as already provided by governments in France, Germany, and the Netherlands”. Stephen Elliott, the chief executive of the Chemical Industries Association, warned that prolonged high energy costs could see factories reduce operations or foreign-owned firms take their business elsewhere. “I can’t stand in front of Kwasi Kwarteng and say that businesses will be shutting a week on Thursday, but I can’t say they’ll be viable and running full tilt, either,” he said. “Things are getting tighter as our ability to pass through cost to our customers is becoming increasingly more difficult. “Our continental European competitors are getting more relief [following the EU’s recent crisis framework enabling more state aid in this area]. If we leave it to the moment when a chemical plant shuts, restarting those is a very challenging thing to do from a health and safety perspective responsibly.” Over the weekend, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, rejected calls for the UK to consider rationing energy, as ministers explore ways to boost Britain’s resilience to international shocks to oil gas markets after the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to record increases in costs. Kwarteng told the Sunday Telegraph that nuclear energy and offshore wind turbines would play a bigger role in energy production, with as many as seven new nuclear plants by 2050. Chemicals companies use disproportionately large amounts of electricity in their processes. Inovyn, a chlorine manufacturer that operates from a plant in Runcorn on the banks of the Mersey, uses as much electricity as the nearby city of Liverpool. Elliott warned that some businesses owned by overseas companies might reconsider their investment in the UK if nothing is done about energy prices. “If you were to ask investors in chemicals around the world, there are good reasons for coming to the UK, but the negative factor has always been energy costs. So UK sites of foreign parents are always marked down on that front and will increasingly be so. Please don’t leave it until we are shutting, because by then it’s probably too late.” Elliott wrote to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in March calling for greater support for UK companies to pay carbon emissions costs, pointing to measures taken by European countries. A BEIS spokesperson said: “We will continue to support energy intensive industries with the costs of energy, and will set out details of further support soon. “Volatile gas prices are a global issue, underscoring the importance of building a strong, homegrown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.” •This article was amended on 4 April 2022 to add a comment from BEIS"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-278-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T13:18:57Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 278 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-278-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-278-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 278 of the invasion","bodyText":"Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut has descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily. As Russia moved fresh formations to the area in recent weeks, neither Russian or Ukrainian forces were able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting Russian forces continue to shell residential infrastructure and housing in the recently liberated city of Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military. In its latest update, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Russian troops were digging trenches and fortifying their positions in preparation for a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive in eastern Kherson. Russians are sporadically shelling cities with no apparent strategic aim other than to cause casualties. The Guardian visited a residential district in Dnipro, where a series of houses were destroyed by a fragmentation warhead, designed to inflict maximum casualties, which had landed on Saturday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed Russia will soon launch a series of new missile strikes on his country, warning his defence forces and citizens to prepare for the attack. He gave the ominous caution in his Sunday evening address. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has warned that Russia will probably continue to attack Ukraine’s power grid, gas infrastructure and basic services. He said Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, was trying to use “the winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar, home to the facility, has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office has said 329 children are currently considered missing in Ukraine, while 12,034 have been deported to Russia. According to the Ukrainian government’s children of war portal, 440 children have been killed as a result of Russia’s war and 851 children are now reported as injured. Russia has “unilaterally postponed” talks with the US aimed at resuming nuclear weapons inspections in Cairo this week, a US state department spokesperson confirmed. Talks between US and Russian officials were scheduled to begin tomorrow. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed in a statement that talks would no longer take place this week. The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted on to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Russia and the US have ways to manage nuclear risks at the level of intelligence agencies, chargée d’affaires of the US embassy in Moscow Elizabeth Rood told Russia’s state news agency Ria Novosti, adding that for now there were no meetings scheduled. The Kremlin’s spokesperson has denied reports that Russian forces were planning to leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, telling reporters they should not look for signs where there were none. The Kremlin said it welcomed a Vatican offer to provide a negotiating platform to resolve the Ukraine conflict, but that Kyiv’s position made this “impossible”. Pope Francis reiterated 10 days ago that the Vatican was ready to do anything possible to mediate and put an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in an interview with the Italian daily La Stampa. The mayor of Kyiv has traded verbal jabs with Zelenskiy and his allies over how to help residents withstand power cuts. Former professional boxer Vitali Klitschko said 430 “warming centres” were helping residents cope with the effects of Russian attacks on power stations, and more than 100 extra centres were planned in case of extreme conditions. Klitschko said Zelenskiy’s allies had engaged in “manipulation” about the city’s efforts. Foreign ministers of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden visited Kyiv today to show support for Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, vowed that Ukraine would win despite Russia’s “barbaric brutality”. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine’s prime minister, has visited Downing Street during her visit to London to discuss the prevention of sexual violence in conflicts. Zelenska met with Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, and prime minister Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty. Hundreds of Ukrainians fled Kherson city on Sunday as Russian shelling intensified. The liberation of Kherson earlier this month marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv, but the population has struggled with a lack of water, heating and electricity. Britain will promise to maintain or increase military aid to Ukraine next year, according to an extract of a speech released by the office of the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, which he plans to deliver on Monday. “We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will maintain or increase our military aid next year. And we will provide new support for air defence,” Sunak will reportedly say. The UK will provide Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to Ukraine as part of its latest aid package. “This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian airstrikes of the war. “We have been restoring electricity generation and supply day after day,” Zelenskiy said in his Sunday night address. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s survival may depend on his value to Vladimir Putin as a future bargaining chip, his chief aide has said. Leonid Volkov, speaking on a visit to London, added that Navalny had lost access to his family and was being permanently detained in a “8 by 12ft” cell after being forced into indefinite solitary confinement by Russian authorities last week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/08/scottishpower-build-150m-green-hydrogen-plant-port-felixstowe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T13:10:08Z","webTitle":"ScottishPower to build £150m green hydrogen plant at Port of Felixstowe ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/08/scottishpower-build-150m-green-hydrogen-plant-port-felixstowe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/08/scottishpower-build-150m-green-hydrogen-plant-port-felixstowe","fields":{"headline":"ScottishPower to build £150m green hydrogen plant at Port of Felixstowe ","bodyText":"ScottishPower is planning to build a £150m green hydrogen plant at the Port of Felixstowe to power trains, trucks and ships, the Guardian can reveal. The energy company has drawn up proposals for a 100megawatt plant at the Suffolk port which will provide enough fuel to power 1300 hydrogen trucks from 2026. The company, owned by €63bn Spanish utilities giant Iberdrola, said demand for the green fuel had stepped up since petrol and diesel prices began to soar last year, emboldening the firm to invest. It has submitted an application to the government’s Net Zero Hydrogen Fund, which provides state backing to develop low-carbon hydrogen projects for the next three years. ScottishPower estimated the whole project could cost between £100m and £150m. ScottishPower plans to build the facility, which will be around the size of a football pitch, on brownfield land within the port, which is one of the busiest in the UK and a trade hub. Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable electricity to drive an electrolyser that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The gas is burned to produce power, emitting water vapour, warm air, and no carbon greenhouse gases. But, depending on the method of burning, it can also cause health-harming air pollution and, as a climate-heating gas itself, any leakage of hydrogen could offset some of the advantages of its use. ScottishPower plans to supply hydrogen to the vehicles and machinery used by the Port of Felixstowe, which is owned by Hutchison Ports, part of Hong Kong based multinational CK Hutchison. About 6,000 heavy goods vehicles a year use the port and logistics providers are increasingly studying hydrogen as an option to cut fuel bills and carbon emissions. The hydrogen will also be used to power trains used for rail freight into the port and shipping vessels. ScottishPower, headquartered in Glasgow, already has significant interests in East Anglia, where it has offshore windfarms. Iberdrola owns Europe’s largest production site for green hydrogen for industrial use, at Puertollano in Spain. Barry Carruthers, the hydrogen director at ScottishPower, told the Guardian: “The strength of demand from the port itself, logistics and distribution companies and rail freight companies has given use the confidence to press ahead with this facility. This is a big, industrial scale project that we’re doing at pace. “The cost of hydrogen is now comparable with diesel so this can be cheaper and cleaner for customers. The market has given us a really good glide path.” ScottishPower is already in the process of developing a smaller hydrogen facility at Whitelee, the UK’s largest onshore windfarm near Glasgow, in partnership with Sheffield’s ITM Power. The 20MW electrolyser, which is due to produce hydrogen by next year, is expected to make up to 8 tonnes of green hydrogen a day, roughly equivalent to fuelling 550 buses to travel from Glasgow to Edinburgh and back again each day. Carruthers said the Felixstowe site would also offer the opportunity to produce “green ammonia” from green hydrogen, which can then be used in agricultural fertiliser. Further up the Suffolk coast, environmental campaigners have protested against proposals for the £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station. But Carruthers said the proposed hydrogen plant “will not dominate the skyline” and is likely to be built within the grounds of the port. “For locals it should mean less diesel pollution and cleaner power for the trains and lorries in the area,” he said. Last week it was announced that dockers at Felixstowe belonging to the Unite union are planning eight days of strike action over pay that are expected to cause serious disruption to the UK’s largest container port. • This article was amended on 18 August 2022.

The EU move, aimed at reducing the number of visas issued to Russian nationals after pressure from eastern member states, falls short of an outright ban but would make getting travel documents significantly more complicated and expensive. The Financial Times quoted one EU official as saying its was “inappropriate for Russian tourists to stroll in our cities” and the bloc had to “send a signal to the Russian population that this war is not OK, it is not acceptable”. Another told the paper that before the end of the year the bloc aimed to go further than ending the agreement, which would remove the current preferential treatment for Russian citizens when they are applying for any kind of EU visa. The bloc’s foreign ministers are due to meet in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, which hold’s the EU’s rotating presidency, on Tuesday where they are expected to give their political backing to the suspension. However, the bloc is far from united on increasingly vocal demands from countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – many of which have stopped issuing visas to Russians for all but essential travel – for an EU-wide ban on Russian tourists. Many other member states continue to issue travel documents to Russian citizens, meaning they can travel freely throughout the Schengen passport-free zone. Finland, which has said Russians are increasingly dodging the closure of EU airspace by using Helsinki airport as a gateway to the zone, announced this month that it would restrict Russian visa applications to one-tenth of the current number. But countries such as Germany have insisted an outright ban would be misguided, and Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, has argued prohibition is “not a good idea”. The bloc “has to be more selective”, Borrell said last week. On the ground in Ukraine, Russian artillery fired at towns across the Dnieper from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, officals said on Sunday, amid mounting concern over a possible radiation disaster. Each sides has accused the other of targeting the plant, which was captured by Russian troops in March but is still run by Ukrainian staff and has become a major hotspot in the conflict, which has now entered its seventh month. The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said on Telegram that Russian forces had struck residential buildings in the region’s main city of Zaporizhzhia, two hours’ drive from the plant, while Ukraine’s army command reported that towns had been struck on the opposite bank of the Dnieper from the plant. Moscow said nine Ukrainian artillery shells had landed in the power station’s grounds, technical personnel were monitoring the condition of the site and radiation levels remained normal. None of the reports could be verified. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Russia had turned the plant into a military base and was putting the whole continent at risk. Both the UN and Kyiv have called for a withdrawal of military equipment and personnel from the plant, which the UN nuclear watchdog is waiting for clearance visit. In eastern Ukraine, where Russian and separatist forces are battling for control, shelling hit the strategically significant cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk but no casualties were reported, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the Donetsk region, said. Defenders foiled Russian attempts to break through around the strategic city of Bakhmut, Ukraine’s armed forces said. Britain’s defence ministry said in its latest briefing that Russia had lost “tens of thousands” of troops and it was not clear how more would be recruited. A decree signed by Vladimir Putin to increase the size of the armed forces from 1.9m to 2.04m was unlikely to make “substantive progress” towards increasing Russia’s combat power, the report said.

Last week we got the first substantial look at where the government may be headed. Perhaps not surprisingly, it raised more questions than it answered. Some of what is proposed – particularly the creation of a federal Environment Protection Agency to decide whether developments can go ahead and uphold a new set of national environmental standards – could revolutionise conservation management across the country. But there are also elements of what the government is proposing that could exacerbate existing problems if not well implemented. Most of the big design decisions are still to come as legislation is drafted in 2023. A quick reminder of just how bad the problem is: a five-yearly report on the state of the environment found that nature in Australia is in a poor and deteriorating state due to a long list of pressures, including the climate crisis, habitat destruction, the spread of invasive species, pollution and mining. The country is a global leader in extinction, having lost more mammal species than any other continent. Nearly 20 ecosystems are showing signs of collapse or near collapse. By any measure, the country’s main environment laws, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999, are failing. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, correctly described the report as a “shocking document” and promised that “under Labor the environment is back on the priority list”. She later announced targets including a goal of “zero extinctions” and protecting 30% of Australian land by 2030. The state of the environment report tells us just how bold the zero extinction target is. Between 2011 and 2021, 377 animal and plant species were newly listed as threatened matters of national environmental significance. Put bluntly, they are on a path towards extinction. Hardly any have conservation plans or the funding needed to arrest their plight. Many more are likely to be added to the list in the years ahead as the catastrophic toll of the black summer bushfires three years ago becomes clearer. We could spend an age listing the failures of the EPBC Act, but three major problems stand out. Far too much of the environmental damage in Australia isn’t referred for assessment under national law before it happens. To give one galling example: hundreds of thousands of hectares of primary and re-growing native forest are bulldozed every year, but 93% of the area cleared between 2000 and 2017 was not even considered under the national laws because it happened without being referred to the commonwealth government for assessment. It means no one is responsible for overseeing most of the damage. Instead, we have a mix of mostly inadequate state and territory laws, some industry exemptions, failing environmental offset schemes, little to no data collection and a whole lot of authorities turning a blind eye. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Secondly, with few exceptions (a ban on nuclear power, for example) the environment minister of the day has near total discretion in deciding how to apply the law. Most who have held the position have prioritised doing the minimum necessary to allow developments to go ahead. These developments are nearly always considered in isolation. Their cumulative impact is routinely ignored. Third, the laws are silent on the climate crisis. A climate trigger, which would allow fossil fuel developments to be blocked or curtailed based on their greenhouse gas emissions, has long been discussed but never introduced. Plibersek’s announcement last week of the government’s response to a two-year-old review of the EPBC Act by the former competition watchdog, Prof Graeme Samuel, addresses only some of these issues directly. The creation of a national EPA – a step that goes further than what Samuel recommended – and the introduction of environmental standards against which conservation protection decisions and major development applications must be measured are potentially transformational steps. To succeed, the EPA will need to be truly independent, have conservation as its primary goal, and be given the funding and powers necessary to enforce the law across the country. The standards will need to be specific and detailed enough to work as measurable benchmarks. On climate change, there is no trigger, but Plibersek says companies will be required to disclose their emissions within Australia and how they planned to reduce them – which sounds like it could be used as a trigger in all but name, depending on the design. One of the biggest question marks is over a proposal to use regional planning, which has been promised to speed up development. It would bring in a traffic light system under which areas deemed to have high environmental value would be protected (a red zone), those with moderate environmental value would be open to development subject to approval processes (orange) and those considered to have lower environmental value would be opened up to rapid development without Commonwealth oversight (green). If well executed, this could expand the parts of the country that are subject to national environment law, and start to factor in cumulative impacts – both necessary steps. But if poorly implemented it could become an arbitrary trade-off, with some nature areas and wildlife sacrificed in return for others being protected. Probably the most controversial element is how the government plans to use environmental offsets. The current use of offsets, under which developments are allowed to go ahead if the developer agrees to protect another existing area, has been an environmental and administrative disaster that has mostly just allowed the destruction of nature. Plibersek says the government will address this by no longer allowing offsets that just protect an existing area while another area is bulldozed. Instead, it would reinforce the mostly ignored “mitigation hierarchy” that places a greater onus on developers to avoid environmental damage and requires a much more substantial investment in environment restoration elsewhere if offsets are used. But conservationists have expressed alarm that the minister plans to entrench a system that would let developers who were unable to find a “like for like” offset to just make a conservation payment to the government. The government suggests the payment would need to be substantial – enough to lead to a “net positive environmental outcome” and make developers think twice about whether they should go ahead as planned. It is not clear how this would work in practice. Would a company be allowed to clear a forest that was home to threatened koalas and greater gliders if they were prepared to pay enough to, say, clean up a couple of polluted rivers? It seems improbable, but the appalling history of offset schemes (explored in depth by Guardian Australia’s Lisa Cox) tells us scepticism is a justified starting point. It is tempting to argue conservation would be better served by a simple combination of substantial funding and sharp regulation. Failing that, bring on the details."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/25/co2-producers-meet-food-needs-halt-production-energy-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T14:55:51Z","webTitle":"UK food and drink sector sounds alarm over CO₂ shortages as plant halts production","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/25/co2-producers-meet-food-needs-halt-production-energy-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/25/co2-producers-meet-food-needs-halt-production-energy-prices","fields":{"headline":"UK food and drink sector sounds alarm over CO₂ shortage as plant halts output","bodyText":"Food and drink industry bodies have sounded the alarm over potential carbon dioxide shortages, after one of the UK’s largest suppliers of the gas said surging energy costs were forcing it to pause production. The US firm CF Industries said soaring natural gas prices meant it would have to “temporarily halt” activity at its remaining UK ammonia plant, which creates CO2 as a byproduct. The plant in Billingham, Teesside, accounts for nearly a third of the UK’s supplies of the gas, which is essential to industries ranging from beer to meat to fizzy drinks and is also used in hospitals and as a coolant in nuclear power plants. Meat processors, brewers, bakers, farmers and soft drink producers all use CO2 in producing their goods and packaging them in inert gas to keep them fresh. It is also required for the stunning before slaughter of animals including pigs and chickens. CF Industries said the shutdown was the result of tough market conditions, noting that current prices for natural gas used in the process were “uneconomical” after rising to twice the level they were a year ago. It expects prices to continue rising in the months ahead. The UK experienced a crisis in CO2 last September, when high energy prices combined with annual maintenance shutdowns brought UK production to a near halt. The government was forced to use taxpayer money to fund a three-week bailout for CF Industries to stave off supply chain chaos, before brokering an emergency deal with the company. The US firm previously accounted for 60% of the UK’s CO2 supplies until it permanently shut another of its fertiliser plants at Ince in Cheshire earlier this summer, a move that has already heaped pressure on industries that rely on the gas. Nick Allen, the chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association, said the closure of the Cheshire plant made UK firms even more vulnerable to domestic supply shocks, and had sent them searching for overseas sources. However, producers in countries including Italy and Germany have also cut production, forcing firms to compete for more limited supplies across Europe. “Whilst we are in a much better position now than we were a year ago, if CF Industries follows through on its threat to close Billingham, the British meat industry will have serious concerns,” Allen said. “Without sufficient CO2 supplies, the UK will potentially face an animal welfare issue with a mounting number of pigs and poultry unable to be sent for processing.” The British Beer and Pub Association said a new shortage would also heap extra pressure on its own members who are struggling to cover surging costs. “The timing of this news couldn’t be worse as our pubs and brewers are already dealing with severe headwinds and pressures on their supply chain,” the association’s chief executive, Emma McClarkin, said. She called on the government to take action. “Our pubs and brewers are between a rock and a hard place and waiting even a few weeks for the government to act could be too long. We need a sustainable plan for the supply of CO2 to our industry and urgent help with rising energy bills for businesses before they’re forced to close their doors.” The government issued a statement on Thursday morning urging the industry to do more to meet demand. “Since last autumn, the CO₂ market’s resilience has improved, with additional imports, further production from existing domestic sources and better stockpiles,” a spokesperson said. “While the government continues to examine options for the market to improve resilience over the longer term, it is essential industry acts in the interests of the public and business to do everything it can to meet demand.” CF Industries said it had notified customers who buy CO2 about the “impending temporary halt” in production, but said it had not yet settled on an exact date for the shutdown or how long it might last. “At this time, CF Fertilisers UK do not anticipate any impact on employees regarding this announcement given the substantial level of activity that will continue to occur at Billingham,” the company said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/28/cabinet-divisions-over-uk-energy-independence-strategy-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-28T12:16:20Z","webTitle":"UK energy independence strategy: what are the cabinet divisions?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/28/cabinet-divisions-over-uk-energy-independence-strategy-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/28/cabinet-divisions-over-uk-energy-independence-strategy-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"UK energy independence strategy: what are the cabinet divisions?","bodyText":"Downing Street’s long-awaited energy independence strategy is not expected to be published until next week, amid wrangling between No 10 and the Treasury over how to fund it. Boris Johnson’s cabinet ministers have a range of views on the best way forward: Kwasi Kwarteng: the business secretary is an avowed enthusiast for green energy sources, and has made clear he thinks the Ukraine situation only makes them more important. He has publicly suggested planning rules may need to be liberalised to facilitate new onshore wind development, reversing the effective moratorium imposed by David Cameron’s government. Kwarteng has also previously made clear his scepticism about fracking, the controversial practice of domestic shale gas extraction. He has toned down his rhetoric of late, however, insisting he has no objection in principle, but wants to see scientific evidence that it is safe. Jacob Rees-Mogg: the Brexit opportunities minister has urged Boris Johnson to press ahead with fracking, whose advocates have become more vocal since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine underlined the arguments for energy independence. On a recent episode of his regular “Moggcast”, he called shale gas “very clean” and dismissed concerns about earth tremors, saying they were “equivalent to a bus passing by your house”, and “not the San Francisco earthquake”. Like most cabinet ministers, Rees Mogg also backs a more rapid expansion of domestic nuclear power. He is more sceptical about onshore wind power, however, with a small-c conservative dislike of turbines scattered across the British countryside. Boris Johnson: the prime minister is enthusiastic about expanding domestic nuclear production. The lengthy timelines mean it will make little short-term contribution to the UK’s energy independence, but he called in industry experts last week to discuss how to speed up the building of new plants. Johnson has been sceptical about wind power in the past, once notoriously suggesting in one of his contrarian columns that it would not “pull the skin off a rice pudding”, but aides say he is now keen on a rapid expansion of offshore wind – and open-minded about onshore generation. On fracking, Kwarteng cited a conversation with Johnson to explain the recent softening of his position. Downing Street insists no decision has been made – but say given the seriousness of the situation, all options must be on the table. Rishi Sunak: the chancellor rarely mentions net zero in his public pronouncements – it didn’t feature in last week’s spring statement speech, for example. Aides say that’s not because he is a sceptic, but because he believes private sector investment will need to do much of the work in funding the transition. Meanwhile, he has been keen to grant new licences for North Sea extraction, telling the Mail on Sunday earlier this month: “In the short term we need to make sure we are helping people with the cost of energy but also recognising that things like natural gas have a role to play in our transition. We are going to get to net zero over decades, not over days and weeks.” Sunak has suggested he is not opposed to fracking in principle, but wants to see evidence that it is safe – a similar line to Kwarteng’s. He and Johnson have been wrangling in recent days about the funding for new nuclear power plants. Michael Gove: The levelling-up secretary told a recent environment reception he was “not convinced” of the case for fracking, and would like to see the development of more onshore – as well as offshore – wind, alongside solar and nuclear. As Kwarteng has made clear, that would be likely to require a change in the planning system – which Gove oversees. The Cameron government did not ban new onshore wind developments, but made them subject to stringent local consultation, which ministers admit has been tantamount to a moratorium. Alok Sharma: with the Glasgow summit over, the UK’s Cop26 president is regarded as the government’s conscience on net zero, telling the Guardian in a December interview, “given that people do see that the UK has shown a great deal of international leadership when it comes to climate, it’s important we maintain that focus across the whole of the UK government”. Not surprisingly, he is known to be sceptical about fracking, and has made clear publicly that drilling more in the North Sea will do nothing to bring down domestic prices. “Ultimately the price that’s going to be generated is going to be the international wholesale gas price,” he has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2021/jan/27/hinkley-point-c-costs-may-rise-by-500m-covid-crisis-nuclear-power-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2021-01-27T10:42:29Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C costs may rise by £500m on back of Covid crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/27/hinkley-point-c-costs-may-rise-by-500m-covid-crisis-nuclear-power-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2021/jan/27/hinkley-point-c-costs-may-rise-by-500m-covid-crisis-nuclear-power-plant","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C costs may rise by £500m on back of Covid crisis","bodyText":"The Covid-19 pandemic could delay construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor by six months and raise its costs by £500m, according to its developer. The fresh delays are expected to take the cost of the UK’s first new nuclear power plant in a generation to £23bn, EDF Energy said, and put back its launch to the summer of 2026. Before the coronavirus outbreak, Hinkley Point was expected to start up by the end of 2025, at a cost of between £21.5bn and £22.5bn. However, EDF Energy, which is owned by the French state, said the pandemic had caused delays of three months last year and was expected to lead to similar delays in 2021. “Ten months after it began, we are still facing the full force of the pandemic,” Stuart Crooks, the managing director of Hinkley Point C, said in a video message to employees. He said that despite increasing the number of workers on the 160-hectare (400-acre) site in Somerset from below 2,000 to more than 5,000, physical-distancing requirements “still limit the number of people we can safely have on site at any one time”. The Covid-19 delays have led to the second major cost increase for Hinkley in under two years after EDF Energy said in 2019 that construction costs had climbed by up to £2.9bn because of delays. Hinkley Point’s costs have risen by £5bn in the last five years. It will cost almost double the amount to build as first thought in 2008, and will begin generating electricity almost a decade later than the original start date of Christmas 2017. Crooks said: “None of this extra cost is carried by British consumers.” The rising cost of the project will be shouldered by EDF Energy, which agreed a guaranteed price of £92.50 for every megawatt-hour of electricity produced by Hinkley. That price remains unchanged by the delays. EDF Energy is still estimated to make a return of between 7.1% and 7.2% on its investment, which will be paid back through energy bills. The nuclear plant is expected to add between £10 and £15 a year to the average energy bill for 35 years, making it one of the most expensive energy projects undertaken. The government is in talks with EDF Energy to build a second nuclear reactor project with its junior partner, China’s CGN, at Sizewell in Suffolk to consolidate what it has learned from the construction of Hinkley Point. However, ministers are unwilling to repeat a similar financing deal for Sizewell after fierce criticism from MPs, consumer groups and green activists, and hope to find a new funding framework to support the plans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2022/mar/04/us-ukraine-biden-democrats-republicans-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T22:22:32Z","webTitle":"Blinken on Ukraine: ‘Suffering is likely to get worse before it gets better’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/mar/04/us-ukraine-biden-democrats-republicans-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2022/mar/04/us-ukraine-biden-democrats-republicans-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Blinken on Ukraine: ‘Suffering is likely to get worse before it gets better’ – as it happened","bodyText":"Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, spoke more from Brussels, warning that when it comes to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the “suffering we’ve already seen is likely to get worse before it gets better.” The Biden administration is asking Congress for $10bn more to aid Ukraine. Joe Biden made some remarks in Washington on manufacturing and infrastructure. A federal appeals court ruled that the Biden administration can continue to rapidly expel migrant families unlawfully crossing the US-Mexico border, but should avoid sending them anywhere they could be persecuted or tortured. Speaking of Poland, a bipartisan group of senators are calling on Joe Biden to expedite the sale of arms to the country amid tensions: Amid the unrest in Europe, vice-president Kamala Harris will head to Poland and Romania next week to reaffirm the US-Nato alliance: And we finally have a statement from Donald Trump about Bill Barr, his second attorney general and the author of a book, out next week but extensively trailed, in which he says his former boss was unfit to be president and still will be if he chooses to run again. In Trump’s words, Barr… … wouldn’t know voter fraud if it was staring him in the face – and it was. The fact is, he was weak, ineffective, and totally scared of being impeached, which the Democrats were constantly threatening to do. They ‘broke’ him. He should have acted much faster on the Mueller Report, instead of allowing the fake Russia, Russia, Russia, Hoax to linger for so long, but it was the Election Fraud and Irregularities that he refused to act on because he wanted to save his own hide – and he did. He never got impeached, contempt charges never went forward, and the Democrats were very happy with him – but I wasn’t. In Barr’s words – and to be fair, the words of many others – Trump’s lie about election fraud was just that, a lie. Barr resigned on 14 December 2020, at a meeting at which Trump gave him a bogus report about supposed fraud in Antrim county, Michigan, which he kept pushing on subordinates after that, as his attempt to overturn the election ran on and up to the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. Here’s more about Barr’s book – what’s in it and, more to the point, what isn’t: A little tidbit from Joe Biden and his meeting today with Sauli Niinisto, the president of Finland: Last night, the Florida senate passed a bill banning access to abortions after 15 weeks. Vice-president Kamala Harris issued a statement today that “the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to do everything in our power to protect access to healthcare and defend a woman’s right to make decisions about her body and determine her future”. “The right of women to make decisions about their own bodies is non-negotiable,” she said. Former vice-president Mike Pence reportedly will call on Republicans to stop repeating the lie that Donald Trump keeps peddling that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. White House press secretary Jen Psaki fielded a question about Lindsey Graham and his comments calling for the assassination of Vladimir Putin. “That is not the position of the United States government that is certainly not the statement you would hear coming from the mouth of anybody working in this administration,” she said. When pressed further on the topic – on whether Joe Biden agreed with Graham that Putin’s death was the only way out of this war – Psaki staunchly doubled down. “The president believes there continues to be a diplomatic path forward,” she said. “President Putin has the ability to deescalate. We have left the door open for months now to engage in deescalation.” Psaki continued: “We are not advocating for killing the leader of a foreign country or a regime change. That is not the policy of the United States.” Read more about the outcry against Graham’s comments here: White House press secretary Jen Psaki addressed the Russian attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. The US embassy in Ukraine called the attack on the nuclear plant a war crime. But Psaki said the determination of Russia’s war crimes is still an ongoing process that is taking place within the administration. “It’s a legal review and a process that goes through the administration,” Psaki said. “What I will say, the intentional targeting of civilians or civilian objects would be considered a war crime. Regardless of legality, this action was the height of irresponsibility. The Kremlin must cease operations around nuclear infrastructure.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki is at the podium for her press briefing and she began with the administration’s request to Congress for more funding for Ukraine. Since 2021, the US has already provided more than $1.4bn to Ukraine, and administration officials are now requesting $10bn more to “deliver additional security assistance to Ukraine, to provide life-saving humanitarian assistance for the Ukrainian people and more support for stronger sanction enforcement and for US troop deployment to reinforce Nato’s eastern flank and deter Russian aggression,” Psaki said. Back to the no-fly zone and whether it can be implemented in other ways than shooting down Russian jets, and how the US assesses Russian military strength after a week of war. Blinken says the US is looking at what can be delivered to Ukraine for it to defend itself, every day. On conclusions about Russian military strength, Blinken says he doesn’t want to draw any yet. What we do know, he says, is “how extraordinary the Ukrainian people are. Their will, their determination, their absolute commitment to defend their country, to defend their freedom, to defend their future. “That’s the story of the past week and it’s an incredibly powerful one.” And with that, he’s gone. Blinken is asked if energy sanctions on Russia are being considered. “As a general proposition, nothing is off the table,” he says, adding that minimising harm to the US and partners and allies is also part of implementing sanctions, which means the US wants to avoid raising prices at the pumps at home. “We have a strong interest in degrading Russia status as a leading energy supplier. Over time, this would be a profound strategic shift. That’s why Nord Stream two was shut down. “That’s why we’re surging [liquid natural gas] to Europe right now, to help accelerate its diversification away from Russian gas. It’s why we’re denying critical technologies to Russia for further energy exploration … this is part of a process to reduce reliance, dependence on Russian energy.” Blinken is asked how many more people have to die before energy sanctions are used but he avoids a direct answer, of course. Secretary of state Antony Blinken has just issued a fresh warning about the war, echoing other leaders of late who have warned that the worst is ahead. An Irish questioner asks how much worse things are going to get in Ukraine, and if “the no to the no fly zone is set in stone completely or would you consider it if this conflict does become a massacre? “And just to follow up – Was it naive of you and of course the Europeans to trust in Putin for diplomacy?” “I think the terrible expectation is that the suffering we’ve already seen is likely to get worse before it gets better,” Blinken says. With regard to the no fly zone, Blinken cites Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato general secretary, in saying that Nato has a responsibility to “ensure the war doesn’t spill over beyond Ukraine”. Shooting down Russian planes could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe, Blinken says. “President Biden has been clear that we are not going to get into a war with Russia. But we are going to tremendous lengths with allies and partners to provide Ukrainians with the means to to effectively defend themselves. And of course, we’re seeing every single day, their extraordinary heroism as well as very, very real results in in what they’re doing to achieve that.” About potential naivety, Blinken says the US was “the opposite of naive” and had warned for months that Putin was planning “an aggression of Ukraine”, and was prepared either way. Blinken is asked if nothing the west and Nato has done has slowed the Russian invasion so far, what does he tell the Ukrainian people. He is also asked if arms supplies can be increased, to include heavier weapons such as jets. Blinken takes the second part first. He’s in contact constantly with the Ukrainian government, he says, and touts how much security assistance has already been given. He says Nato and the EU have discussed “what more we can do and how to do it effectively”, with the foreign minister of Ukraine contributing. “We’re working on that every day,” he adds. No specifics – no surprise there. He touts damage to the Russian economy as a result of sanctions and so forth. “I have a list five pages long of all the businesses that have left Russia,” Blinken says, adding: “Let’s see how Russia responds to that.” “Unfortunately this is not like flipping a lightswitch,” he says about the prospects of increasing aid and implementing harsher measures, even though “virtually the entire world” supports Ukraine. “There is a huge weight bearing down on Russia,” he says. “Let’s see what the impact is.” Of the Russian attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant yesterday, Blinken says: “The Kremlin should immediately cease all attacks around Ukrainian nuclear facilities and allow civilian personnel do their work to ensure the facilities’ safety and security, as both the IAEA director general and a resolution adopted yesterday by the agency’s board of governors have called on Russia to do.” He says Nato, the EU and other partner nations have never before worked so closely together. He praises those countries which have accepted Ukrainian refugees. Humanitarian corridors are being worked on, he said, to allow people out and supplies in. He says Vladimir Putin cannot have imagined the united response and the tide of protest that has “increasingly turned Russia into a pariah state”. “We do not oppose the Russian people,” Blinken says. He also says the US “will defend every inch of Nato territory”, if necessary. He takes questions. Here’s our latest reporting on the fighting in Ukraine: Tony Blinken is now speaking in Brussels. “Stability in Europe hangs in the balance and the international rules based order that’s critical to maintaining peace and security is being put to the test by Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine,” he says, to begin. Here’s the state department stream. The Biden administration can continue to rapidly expel migrant families unlawfully crossing the US-Mexico border, but should avoid sending them anywhere they could be persecuted or tortured, a federal appeals court ruled today. The mixed ruling on concerning the increasingly-controversial Title 42 rule largely upholds restrictions put in place by the administration of former Republican president Donald Trump aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19 even as many other coronavirus-related border bans have been lifted. Reuters writes: A group of affected migrants, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other non-profit organizations, sued over the expulsion policy known as Title 42, which the administration of Joe Biden, a Democrat who took office a year ago, has largely kept in place. They argued the expulsions were illegal but the panel of appeals court judges disagreed, finding it likely that the covered migrants “have no right to be in the United States, and the Executive can immediately expel them.” The court added however, that “the Executive cannot remove aliens to a country where their ’life or freedom would be threatened’ on account of their ’race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion’” or “to a country where they will likely be tortured.“ Biden has fought to retain the Title 42 order, which was issued in March 2020 by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Many Democrats, health experts and pro-immigrant advocates oppose the order, saying it unlawfully cuts off access to asylum and is not supported by scientific evidence. Border arrests soared to record levels in 2021 during Biden’s first year in office and could climb even higher this year, officials told Reuters in January. A federal judge ruled last September that the Title 42 policy could not be applied to families but the Biden administration appealed that decision. Early in his presidency, Biden exempted unaccompanied children from the expulsion policy. Since Biden took office in January 2020, more than a million migrants have been expelled under the order. Many of those have been people who have crossed the border more than once. Joe Biden did not take questions at his event on manufacturing and infrastructure, and therefore did not make any new comment on the Ukraine crisis. His secretary of state, Tony Blinken, is however due to talk in Brussels soon. The Department of State live stream is here. Biden describes his administration’s efforts to make the federal government buy more American goods, including making agencies which want to spend money abroad publicly seek waivers to do so. He ties this effort back to the early days of the pandemic, when states and cities had to buy PPE and Covid tests abroad. “Yes, we’re going to keep trading with our allies and friends,” Biden says, saying the US also needs “resilient supply chains of our own” – a nod to difficulties affecting many sectors of the economy which are likely to be worsened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “Last year,” Biden says, “I released a plan to increase the number of contracts that go to small disadvantaged businesses by 50% by 2025. This means more contracts will go to Black-, brown-, Asian American-, women-owned and veteran-owned small businesses in every state and territory, in every industry, from services to manufacturing to agriculture.” And with that, he thanks everyone in attendance and leaves the stage without taking questions. Joe Biden begins with a joke and a happy birthday to an aide, and thanks to the other speakers. He then revisits his State of the Union remarks about economic progress on his watch, touting various successes. “This is what it looks like to grow an economy from the bottom up and the middle out,” the president says. He also underlines progress against the coronavirus pandemic, after “two of the hardest years this country has ever faced”. “We’re coming back stronger as a country,” he says. So is American manufacturing, the president says, with companies investing at home rather than overseas. He gives examples of companies “innovating and inspiring” other companies, Tesla among them. He says he just had a “viral” (he means virtual) tour of Siemens facilities around the US. Joe Biden is speaking in Washington, about his infrastructure policy and spending. The great Joan E Greve covered some of the why, and the role of Siemens, here earlier. The White House stream is here. America is divided. That’s not news. But the authoritarian ruler in the Kremlin deciding to invade a democratic neighbor – that’s the type of international crisis that traditionally might have inspired some closing of the ranks: set differences aside, let domestic quarrels rest. But conservatives are evidently out on the idea of patriotic unity. The right’s reactions to Russia’s attack on Ukraine have ranged from blatant admiration for Vladimir Putin to anti-Russian saber-rattling combined with a shrill critique of Joe Biden. Donald Trump initially called the invasion “genius”; he then defended his position at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) over the weekend, adding that Nato was “not so smart” and “our leaders are dumb.” Meanwhile, America’s most successful cable news host Tucker Carlson ridiculed American solidarity with Ukraine, a country he derided as “a tyranny”, led by “the people who paid off Joe Biden’s family”. Trump is the political leader of the Republican party and probably its next presidential candidate. Carlson is one of the premier rightwing culture warriors in the country. Trump and Carlson are not fringe voices, and they aren’t outliers either: a last week’s CPAC, conservative speakers focused their ire on Biden’s supposed weakness as the real cause for Putin’s aggression; and they left no doubt who they considered the biggest threat – the “enemy within”, as Senator Rick Scott put it, the “militant left – wing in our country”. Full column: Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, is in Brussels to meet with the foreign ministers of Nato and European Council. Ahead of his meetings, he warned that Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, will open “a Pandora’s box of trouble” for entire world if he continues his attack on Ukraine. The United Nations security council convened for an emergency meeting in New York today after Russian forces attacked and seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said “Putin must stop this madness and he must stop this now”. Joe Biden is meeting today with Sauli Niinisto, the president of Finland, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine raises the possibility that Finland could form a closer alliance with Nato. Conservative firebrand Lindsey Graham is calling for the assassination of Putin. Close Donald Trump ally Roger Stone raged at the former US president in the aftermath of the failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election, according to a blockbuster report from the Washington Post, telling a friend Trump was a “disgrace” who would go to prison and adding: “He betrayed everybody.” The Post said it had viewed 20 hours of footage of the political operative that had been shot for a forthcoming documentary. The footage, it said, showed Stone: Meeting and corresponding with members of a far-right militia since indicted for seditious conspiracy over the Capitol riot on January 6. Discussing a plan in which Trump would issue a blanket pardon to co-conspirators in the attempt to overturn the election, Senator Ted Cruz and congressman Jim Jordan among them. Saying Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, should be “punished” in a way that would leave him “braindead”. Suggesting violence against protesters for racial justice would be possible with the election out of the way. “Once there’s no more election,” Stone reportedly said, “there’s no reason why we can’t mix it up. These people are going to get what they’ve been asking for.” Full story: The supreme court has reinstated the death penalty for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the man convicted of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 that killed three people and injured hundreds of others. The United Nations security council convened for an emergency meeting in New York today after Russian forces attacked and seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, had harsh words about the attack, saying it was “incredibly reckless and dangerous and it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe”. “By the grace of god, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,” she said. While she had a strong message about the escalation to attacks on nuclear plants - “nuclear facilities cannot become part of this conflict” - Thomas-Greenfield went harder on the overall war itself. “Russia’s invasion has turned half a million children into refugees,” she said. “Russia has killed thousands of Ukrainians and sacrificed thousand more Russian soldiers’ lives in the process. Russia is destroying critical infrastructure, which is denying people drinking water to stay alive and gas that is preventing people from freezing to death in the middle of winter. The humanitarian impact of this destruction will be significant.” She continued: “One hundred and forty-one nations across the world have called loudly and clearly on President Putin to stop this brutal, unjustified, unprovoked attack. Not only has he not listened, we just witnessed a dangerous new escalation that represents a dire threat to all of Europe and the world. “To my Russian counterparts: This council needs answers. We need to hear you say, this won’t happen again,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “We call on you to withdraw your troops and weaponry from Ukraine. We call on you to respect Ukraine’s borders, its people and the UN charter. We call on you to respect your own troops enough to not send them into an unjust war, or on a suicide mission against a nuclear power plant.” Thomas-Greenfield finished by noting that Russian forces are now 20 miles away from Ukraine’s second largest nuclear facility. “This imminent danger continues,” she said. “President Putin must stop this humanitarian catastrophe by ending this war and ceasing these unconscionable attacks against the people of Ukraine,” she said. “Mr Putin must stop this madness and he must stop this now.” Joe Biden is meeting today with Sauli Niinisto, the president of Finland, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine raises the possibility that Finland could form a closer alliance with Nato. Though Finland already cooperates with Nato, the country is not a member. Support for full membership has grown in the country in the days since the invasion: A poll by public broadcaster Yle last Monday said 53% of Finns support joining. In late January, the number was just 28% when the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper asked the question. Biden and Niinisto “will discuss the US-Finnish defense relationship, which is very strong and in fact complements Finland’s close partnership with Nato”, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters ahead of the visit. Niinisto said in a statement that people should “keep a cool head and assess carefully the impact of the changes that have already taken place and of those that might still happen.” Siemens has announced that it will invest $54m to expand US production of electrical parts, which will aid in the construction of everything from electric vehicle chargers to data centers. Siemens said the investment will lead to the creation of 300 manufacturing jobs in the country. The CEO of Siemens USA, Barbara Humpton, is expected to join Joe Biden at the White House today to celebrate the new investment. The White House championed Siemens’ announcement as the latest indication of how Biden’s “Made in America” agenda is strengthening US supply chains and creating good-paying jobs. “You may recall the previous administration made big claims on how they would restore America’s industrial might. That turned out to be just rhetoric,” a senior administration official said. “President Biden followed through on his commitment to make ‘Buy American’ real.” In his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Biden emphasized his commitment to reinvigorating US manufacturing to strengthen both the economy as a whole and individual families’ financial prospects. “There’s something happening in America,” Biden said Tuesday. “Just look around, and you’ll see an amazing story – the rebirth of pride that comes from stamping products ‘Made in America,’ the revitalization of American manufacturing.” Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, is now heading out of his meeting with Nato’s foreign ministers in Brussels and going into one with the European Council, the policy-guiding arm of the European Union. Before his next meeting, Blinken took a moment to speak to the press along with Josep Borrell, the vice president of the European Commission, and applaud the EU on taking “historic” action, “both with regard to sanctions and support for Ukraine”. “We are faced together with what is President Putin’s war of choice, a war that was unprovoked and that is having horrific consequences for real people, for mothers, fathers, for children,” Blinken said. “We see the images on TV and it has to stop. We are committed to doing everything we can to make it stop.” Blinken continued: “We’ve established together, after two world wars, that are so important to keeping peace and security for everyone, principles that President Putin is egregiously violating every single day - the notion that one country can’t simply go in and change the borders of another country by force or take it over, the principle that one country cannot dictate to another the choices that its citizens would make about their future, the principle that we are past the time of spheres of influence where one country subjugates its neighbors to its will. “All of those things are at stake and if we allow those principles to be challenged as Putin is doing now with impunity, that will open a Pandora’s box of trouble, not just for us, but, quite frankly, for the entire world.” As part of his “Made in America” agenda to bolster the country’s manufacturing sector, Joe Biden is also implementing changes to the Buy American Act. As of now, products under consideration for federal procurement qualify as being made in America if 55% of the value of their component parts are domestically manufactured. The Biden administration will change that threshold to 75% by 2029, with incremental increases to the requirement over the next seven years. A senior administration official explained that the incremental nature of the policy change would “allow both small and large contractors time to transition their supply chains to domestic suppliers and to increase their use of American-made components”. “It marks just one of many significant improvements to domestic sourcing policy that the Biden-Harris administration will be rolling out to ensure that taxpayer dollars help America’s businesses compete in strategic industries and help America’s workers thrive,” the official said. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, took a strong stance on the war today as he arrived for a meeting of Nato’s foreign ministers in Brussels, condemning what he described as Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine. “Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us we are ready for it and we will defend every inch of Nato territory,” Blinken said. However, Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg hedged their position a bit this morning, rejecting Ukraine’s demand for no-fly zones. “We are not part of this conflict, and we have a responsibility to ensure it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine,” Stoltenberg told reporters. “We understand the desperation but we also believe that if we did that (a no-fly zone) we would end up with something that could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe involving much more countries and much more suffering,” Stoltenberg said. Politico took a look at the cracking opposition to the US agreeing to aiding in a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Right now, Joe Biden is in the tricky position of remaining true to his promise to protect Nato territories without escalating into further war with Russia, while at the same time getting more and more pressure to intervene in a way that won’t lead to boots on the ground. On Friday. Nato allies rejected Ukraine’s demand for no-fly zones. “We understand the desperation but we also believe that if we did that (a no-fly zone) we would end up with something that could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe involving much more countries and much more suffering,” Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said. But in Washington, Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger is pushing for a no-fly zone. Politico is reporting that Republican senator Roger Wicker is also in support, as well as Democratic policymakers like Evelyn Farkas, the top official for Ukraine in the Obama Pentagon. Amid soaring tensions and continuous bloodshed in Ukraine, conservative firebrand Lindsey Graham is calling for the assassination of Vladimir Putin. The Republican senator from South Carolina made his remarks first on Fox News with Sean Hannity - who has suggested assassinating Putin previously - before repeating his sentiments on Twitter. Graham’s remarks were met with dismay from both sides of the aisle, with progressive congresswoman Ilhan Omar tweeting, “Seriously, wtf?” Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, also responded by calling Graham’s remarks “an exceptionally bad idea”. Even far-right extremist congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green, who won her seat expressing support for the conspiracy theory QAnon, called Graham’s statements “irresponsible, dangerous and unhinged”. “We need leaders with calm minds and steady wisdom,” she tweeted. “Not blood thirsty warmongering politicians trying to tweet tough by demanding assassinations. Americans don’t want war.” Greetings, live blog readers. Happy Friday. Per usual, we’ll have all our live updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine here, so make sure to keep an eye on that. But on our end, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, took a strong stance on the war today as he arrived for a meeting of Nato’s foreign ministers in Brussels, condemning what he described as Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine. “Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us we are ready for it and we will defend every inch of Nato territory,” Blinken said. Meanwhile in Washington, the Washington Post is reporting that previously unseen documentary footage shows Roger Stone, longtime ally of Donald Trump, working to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and secure pardons in the aftermath of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol.

Energoatom, the state-run operator of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, said in a statement: “Three strikes were recorded on the site of the plant, near one of the power blocks where the nuclear reactor is located.” Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the plant, saying a leak of radiation had been avoided only by luck. Vladimir Putin has met Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for talks that were expected to focus on Russia’s war in Ukraine and that are being rumoured to include Kremlin efforts to circumvent western sanctions. The Russian president welcomed Erdoğan to Sochi, a resort city on the Black Sea, by thanking the Turkish president for help in securing an international deal that resumed grain exports from Ukraine that had been disrupted by the Kremlin war machine – as well as Russian foodstuffs and fertilisers – to world markets. They agreed to boost cooperation in the transport, agriculture, finance and construction industries, they said in a joint statement after a four-hour meeting. Three ships carrying almost 60,000 tonnes of grain between them have departed Ukrainian Black Sea ports and are on their way to Britain, Ireland and Turkey respectively. Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, said he planned “to ensure ports have the ability to handle more than 100 vessels per month”. Russia says it is ready to talk about a prisoner swap with the US following Thursday’s nine-year jail sentence for US basketball player Brittney Griner. However, the Kremlin said any such negotiations should not be played out publicly. Amnesty International has said it stands by its accusation that Ukraine is endangering civilians by creating army bases in residential areas to counter Russian forces, after a report from the rights group prompted a furious response from Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, criticised Amnesty over the report published on Thursday, saying the rights group was drawing a false equivalence between Ukraine as the victim of aggression and the Russian invaders. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has raised concerns about the “security and safety” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, saying Russia has “used artillery units based in these areas to target Ukrainian territory on the western bank of the Dnipro [Dnieper] river”. A European Union plan to cut gas use and help Germany wean itself off dependency on Russia will come into effect early next week, the bloc’s presidency said on Friday. Last week, EU member states agreed to reduce their use of gas by 15% over the winter, with exceptions for some countries and despite opposition from Hungary. Canada is sending up to 225 Canadian armed forces to the UK to recommence the training of Ukrainian military recruits, the Canadian defence minister has announced. Since 2015, Canada has trained 33,000 Ukrainian military and security personnel but in February paused aspects of the training. A US official has accused Moscow of preparing to plant fake evidence to make it look like the recent mass killing of Ukrainian prisoners of war in an attack on a Russian-controlled jail was caused by Ukraine. Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame over last week’s strikes on the prison in Kremlin-controlled Olenivka, in eastern Ukraine. A leading Russian hypersonics expert has been arrested on suspicion of treason, the state-controlled Tass news agency reported on Friday. Andrei Shiplyuk heads the hypersonics laboratory at the Novosibirsk Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, according to the institute’s website, and has in recent years coordinated research to support the development of hypersonic missile systems, Reuters reports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/22/us-and-south-korea-begin-largest-military-drills-for-years-as-north-ramps-up-tensions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T04:04:21Z","webTitle":"US and South Korea begin largest military drills for years as North ramps up tensions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/22/us-and-south-korea-begin-largest-military-drills-for-years-as-north-ramps-up-tensions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/22/us-and-south-korea-begin-largest-military-drills-for-years-as-north-ramps-up-tensions","fields":{"headline":"US and South Korea begin largest military drills for years as North ramps up tensions","bodyText":"The US and South Korea have begun their biggest joint military drills in years – a show of force that is expected to raise tensions with an increasingly hostile North Korea. The exercises, known as Ulchi Freedom Shield, are being seen as a sign of the allies’ determination to restore large-scale training after they cancelled some regular drills and scaled down others to facilitate nuclear talks, and because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Details of the operation have not been released, but past exercises have involved tens of thousands of troops and large numbers of aircraft warships and tanks. They will reportedly include simulated joint attacks, frontline reinforcements of arms and fuel, and removals of weapons of mass destruction. The two militaries said in a joint statement said the drills were a response to an “increased volume and scale of [North Korean] missile tests” over the past year. “With this in mind, and considering the evolving threat … both leaders committed to expanding the scope and scale of combined military exercises and training, they said, adding that Ulchi Freedom Shield would “bolster combined readiness”. The 2019 exercises were cancelled after Donald Trump’s first summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore, the previous year. Trump’s surprise concession was seen as an attempt to persuade Kim to abandon his nuclear weapons programme amid a flurry of diplomacy led by the then president and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in. Four years on, Washington and Seoul have nothing substantive to show for their efforts at engagement. The North has resumed missile tests – including its first launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile at full range since 2017 – and speculation is building that it is preparing to conduct what would be its seventh nuclear test. The US has said it will consider deploying strategic assets – which could theoretically include tactical nuclear weapons – if the North tests a nuclear device. South Korea’s new president, Yoon Suk-yeol, took office in May promising a harder line against North Korean provocations that would include “normalising” the military exercises and boosting his country’s defences against the North. The resumption of the drills suggests that South Korea and the US, which has 28,500 troops in the country, have reverted to robust displays of their combined military might in the wake of North Korea’s resumption of ballistic missile tests. “The significance of this joint exercise is rebuilding the South Korea-US alliance and solidifying the combined defence posture by normalising … combined exercises and field training,” the South Korean defence ministry said. While the allies insist the field exercises are designed to plan their response to a North Korean attack, Pyongyang routinely condemns them as a rehearsal for an invasion, and in the past has responded with missile launches. The drills, which will end on 1 September, began against a backdrop of increasingly hostile rhetoric from the North. It recently warned of “deadly retaliation” against the South, which it blamed for its Covid-19 outbreak, while Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un’s influential sister, last week dismissed Yoon’s offer of economic help in return for denuclearising as “absurd”, warning that the North would never “barter” its nuclear deterrent for aid. Kim Jong-un, whose until recently appears to have been focused on containing the coronavirus outbreak, has said his country is “ready to mobilise” its nuclear capability in any war with the US and North Korea, although the regime has always insisted its nuclear weapons are a deterrent against a “hostile” US. In a TV interview last month, Choe Jin, the deputy director of a thinktank run by North Korea’s foreign ministry, said the US and South Korea would face “unprecedented” security challenges unless they abandoned their “hostile military stance” against the North, including joint drills. The North has been conducting missile tests at a record pace, with more than 30 ballistic missile launches this year, as it continues to pressure Washington to accept its status as a legitimate nuclear power – and one that some experts believe now has the ability to carry out a nuclear strike against the US mainland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/apr/13/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-plan-to-release-treated-fukushima-water","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-13T03:56:27Z","webTitle":"Everything you need to know about the plan to release treated Fukushima water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/13/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-plan-to-release-treated-fukushima-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/apr/13/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-plan-to-release-treated-fukushima-water","fields":{"headline":"Everything you need to know about the plan to release treated Fukushima water","bodyText":"Japan’s decision to release more than 1m tonnes of treated radioactive water from the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea has sparked controversy inside and outside the country. Here are some questions and answers about the plan, which is expected to take decades to complete. What is the processed water? Since the 2011 nuclear disaster, radioactive water has accumulated at the plant, including liquid used for cooling, and rain and groundwater that has seeped in. An extensive pumping and filtration system known as Alps (advanced liquid processing system) extracts tonnes of newly contaminated water each day and filters out most radioactive elements. The plant operator, Tepco, has built more than 1,000 tanks to hold some 1.25m tonnes of processed water at the site but they will be full by the second half of 2022. The Alps process removes most of the radioactive isotopes to levels below international safety guidelines for nuclear plant waste water. But it cannot remove some, including tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that experts say is only harmful to humans in very large doses. The half-life of tritium – the time needed for one half the atoms of a radioactive isotope to decay – is 12.3 years. In humans, it has an estimated biological half-life of seven to 10 days. How will it be released? Japan’s government has backed a plan to dilute the processed water and release it into the sea. The government says the process meets international standards, and it has been endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “Releasing into the ocean is done elsewhere,” IAEA’s director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has said. “It’s not something new. There is no scandal here.” The release is not likely to begin for at least two years and will take decades. A government spokesman, Katsunobo Kato, said the dilution would reduce tritium levels to well below standards set domestically and by the World Health Organization for drinking water, with IAEA supervision. Why is it controversial? Environmental groups like Greenpeace, which opposes nuclear power, say radioactive materials like carbon-14 that remain in the water can “be easily concentrated in the food chain”. They allege that accumulated doses over time could damage DNA, and want to see the water stored until technology is developed to improve filtration. Local fishing communities worry that years of work to convince consumers that Fukushima’s seafood is safe will be wiped out by the release. “The message from the government that the water is safe is not reaching the public, that’s the huge problem,” an official with the association of Fukushima fishermen unions told Agence France-Presse. He said trading partners had warned they would stop selling their products and consumers had said they would stop eating Fukushima seafood if the water were released: “Our efforts in the past decade to restore the fish industry will be for nothing.” What about Fukushima seafood? The government says radioactive elements in the water are far below international standards, pointing out that waste water is regularly discharged from nuclear plants elsewhere. Even releasing all the stored water in a single year would produce “no more than one-thousandth the exposure impact of natural radiation in Japan,” the foreign ministry said in a reply to a UN report. For food, Japan nationally sets a standard of no more than 100 becquerels of radioactivity per kilogram (Bq/kg), compared with 1,250 Bq/kg in the EU and 1,200 in the US. But for Fukushima produce, the level is set even lower, at just 50 Bq/kg, in an attempt to win consumer trust. Hundreds of thousands of food items have been tested in the region since 2011. What do scientists say? Michiaki Kai, an expert on radiation risk assessment at Japan’s Oita University of Nursing and Health Sciences, said it was important to control the dilution and volume of released water. But “there is consensus among scientists that the impact on health is minuscule”, he told AFP. Still, “it can’t be said the risk is zero, which is what causes controversy”. Geraldine Thomas, chair of molecular pathology at Imperial College London and an expert on radiation, said tritium “does not pose a health risk at all – and particularly so when you factor in the dilution factor of the Pacific Ocean”. She said carbon-14 was also not a health risk, arguing that chemical contaminants in seawater like mercury should concern consumers more “than anything that comes from the Fukushima site”. On eating Fukushima seafood, “I would have no hesitation whatsoever,” she added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-curfew-begins-in-kherson-ahead-of-expected-ukraine-counteroffensive","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-06T17:27:38Z","webTitle":"Car bomb kills one and injures pro-Kremlin writer in Russian city – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-curfew-begins-in-kherson-ahead-of-expected-ukraine-counteroffensive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-curfew-begins-in-kherson-ahead-of-expected-ukraine-counteroffensive","fields":{"headline":"Car bomb kills one and injures pro-Kremlin writer in Russian city – as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is almost 8:30pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s headlines: A prominent Russian nationalist writer, Zakhar Prilepin, was wounded in a car bombing in the region of Nizhny Novgorod on Saturday, the Russian state news agency Tass said, in an attack that Russia immediately blamed on Ukraine and the west. Tass quoted a source in the emergency services as saying the writer’s car was blown up. “He survived, but was wounded and is conscious,” the source was quoted as saying. Russia has been accused of attacking the besieged city of Bakhmut with incendiary phosphorus weapons, BBC News reported. Ukraine’s military shared drone footage of what appeared to show Bakhmut ablaze as white phosphorus rains down on the city. Ukraine hailed the return of 45 Azov battalion fighters captured during the battle for Mariupol while Russia said three of its pilots had been released by Kyiv, but neither side gave a full account of the apparent prisoner swap, Reuters reports. The freed Ukrainian prisoners included 42 men and three women from the Azov battalion, said Andriy Yermak, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office. Ukraine’s air force has claimed to have downed a Russian hypersonic missile over Kyiv using newly acquired American Patriot defence systems, the first known time the country has been able to intercept one of Moscow’s most modern missiles. Air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk said in a Telegram post that the Kinzhal-type ballistic missile had been intercepted in an overnight attack on the Ukrainian capital earlier in the week. It was also the first time Ukraine is known to have used the Patriot defence systems. Russian shelling killed six Ukrainian explosives experts engaged in demining operations in the southern Kherson region, the Ukrainian emergency services said on Saturday. The emergency services, in a report on Telegram, said two other members of the de-mining team were injured, along with a female nurse, and were being treated in hospital, Reuters reports. Concerns in the Russian leadership about its vulnerability to attacks and the potential for public protests over the Ukraine war have contributed to the decision to cancel many Victory Day parades, citing security concerns, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its latest intelligence briefing, the ministry said six Russian regions, occupied Crimea and 21 cities had cancelled their parades on Tuesday marking the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. Russia is still not satisfied with how the issue of Russian agricultural exports as part of the Black Sea grain deal is being resolved, Tass news agency quoted deputy foreign minister Sergey Vershinin as saying on Saturday after the latest talks with a top UN official. “We are still not satisfied with the progress. This is very important for us,” Vershinin said. He was speaking after talks in Moscow with the United Nations’ top trade official Rebeca Grynspan, Tass said. Poland will demand European Union sanctions on imports of Russian farm products, its ambassador to the EU Andrzej Sadoś was quoted as saying by PAP news agency. “Europe isn’t threatened by disruptions in supply chain of farm products now, contrary, we have a problem of surpluses. We are resolving a problem of increased imports of farm products from Ukraine,” Sadoś said, according to PAP. Switzerland’s parliament has approved a request from Ukrainian authorities for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address it. The invitation, announced in a statement late on Friday, comes amid pressure on Switzerland’s government to break with a centuries-old tradition of neutrality and end a ban of exports of Swiss weapons to conflict zones such as Ukraine. Kherson’s weekend curfew is the latest inconvenience for residents who, after enduring months of Russian occupation last year, have been subjected to daily bombardments by Russian troops encamped nearby on the other side of the River Dnipro. Despite their retreat from Kherson city last November, Russian forces still hold large swathes of territory in the wider Kherson region that Ukraine wants to recapture, Reuters reports. Some residents left Kherson in cars and buses on Friday while others stocked up on groceries before a 56-hour curfew began on Friday evening in the southern Ukrainian city. Reuters reports that the announcement of the curfew, lasting until Monday morning, prompted speculation in Kherson that the city was about to be used as a launch point for Ukraine’s much-anticipated counterattack. Strikes on Russian infrastructure including drone attacks on refineries and train sabotage have multiplied in recent weeks, with experts suggesting they are part of Ukraine’s preparations for an expected spring offensive. Agence France-Presse reports that Kyiv has not claimed any of the acts denounced by Moscow as Ukrainian “sabotage” of “unprecedented momentum”, but the majority appear to target Russian army supply chains in border regions and in annexed Crimea, a base for Russian troops. Ukraine sent its first lady, Olena Zelenska, and Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, as the country’s representatives to King Charles’s coronation in London on Saturday. Zelenska posted on her official Facebook: “It is an honour for us and prime minister Denys Shmyhal to attend the coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla The royal family here at Westminster Abbey to wish on behalf of all of Ukraine successful governance and prosperity to the country.” The leader of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force has said his forces will leave Bakhmut, which they have been trying to capture since last summer. Yevgeny Prigozhin said they would pull back on Wednesday 10 May – ending their involvement in the war’s longest battle – because of heavy losses and inadequate ammunition supplies, and he asked defence chiefs to put regular army troops in their place. But Ukraine said Wagner fighters were reinforcing positions to try to seize the eastern city before that date. Prigozhin earlier released a video showing him standing in a field of Russian corpses and blaming defence chiefs for the losses suffered by his fighters in Ukraine, appearing to reignite his simmering feud with Russian top brass. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has carried out an inspection of troop readiness for forces engaged in the war, in an apparent coded response to Prigozhin’s criticism. Ukraine said two people had been killed and nine wounded in the eastern Donetsk region and electricity distribution networks had been damaged by shelling in the Donetsk and Kherson regions. Authorities in the Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia have begun evacuating villages near the frontline. The Russian-installed governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, announced the move in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive aimed at retaking the area, claiming Kyiv’s forces had “stepped up shelling of settlements close to the frontline” in the past few days. Engineers have reduced the risk of a dam bursting and damaging the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a senior Russian official was quoted by state news agency Tass as saying on Friday. Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the general director of energy engineering firm Rosenergoatom, said specialists had begun discharging water from the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam on the Dnieper River in southern Ukraine. A Moscow court has ordered the arrest of a theatre director and a playwright on charges of “justifying terrorism” over an award-winning play about Russian women recruited online to marry radical Islamists in Syria. Director Yevgeniya Berkovich and author Svetlana Petriychuk were placed in custody until 4 July, Russian news agencies reported. Bill Clinton has said he knew in 2011 it was just “a matter of time” before the Russian president attacked Ukraine. “Vladimir Putin told me in 2011 – three years before he took Crimea – that he did not agree with the agreement I made with Boris Yeltsin,” the former US president recalled. “He said … ‘I don’t agree with it. And I do not support it. And I am not bound by it.’ And I knew from that day forward it was just a matter of time.” That’s it from me for today. We’ll be closing this blog shortly. Thanks for joining us. Russian shelling killed six Ukrainian explosives experts engaged in demining operations in the southern Kherson region, the Ukrainian emergency services said on Saturday. The emergency services, in a report on Telegram, said two other members of the de-mining team were injured, along with a female nurse, and were being treated in hospital, Reuters reports. Russia said its forces had downed a Ukrainian missile over the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, amid an expected offensive by Kyiv, AFP reports. The Moscow-appointed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said on social media: Air defence forces shot down a ballistic missile over the Republic of Crimea. The missile was launched with Ukraine’s Grim-2 system. There was no damage or casualties. His adviser, Oleg Kryuchkov, later said two such missiles were shot down, Russian news agencies reported. AFP was unable to verify the claims. State-run agency TASS said this was the second official confirmation of a Grim missile being neutralised over Crimea, after a first reported case in April. Russia has in recent weeks seen an uptick in drone incursions and train sabotage, which experts suggest are part of Ukraine’s preparations for an expected spring offensive. A prominent pro-Kremlin writer and Russian nationalist has been injured in a car “explosion” and one other person was killed, the interior ministry in Moscow has said, after a string of apparent drone attacks in Russia amid the fighting in Ukraine. “According to initial reports, one person was killed by the explosion, and the writer Zakhar Prilepin, who was in the car, was injured” in the Nizhny Novgorod region about 250 miles (400km) east of Moscow, the ministry said. The investigative committee, which investigates serious crimes, said Prilepin was “travelling with his family” at the time. Russian state-run agencies cited sources in the emergency services saying the writer sustained leg injuries.

The freed Ukrainian prisoners included 42 men and three women from the Azov battalion, said Andriy Yermak, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office. Azov battalion fighters, who did much of the fighting in the failed defence of the port city of Mariupol, have been lionized as heroes by many Ukrainians but are widely vilified in Russia. On the Telegram app in a post that did not mention the release of Russian prisoners, Yermak said: Excellent news on this sunny day. We are returning home 45 of our people. Thirty-five privates and sergeants, 10 officers. The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement that three pilots had been returned and were being provided with medical and psychological assistance. The statement, which did not mention the 45 Ukrainian prisoners, said: As a result of a difficult negotiation process, three Russian pilots of the Russian Aerospace Forces, who had been in mortal danger while in captivity, were returned from Kyiv-controlled territory. There were no reports on Russian state media of additional Russian prisoner releases. Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, which coordinates prisoner exchanges with Russia, did not immediately respond to a request for more details. Moscow and Kyiv have agreed a number of prisoner exchanges since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February last year. Russia says it launched its “special military operation” to counter a threat from Kyiv’s relations with the west, while Ukraine and its western partners say it was an unprovoked land grab.

Ukraine said two people had been killed and nine wounded in the eastern Donetsk region and electricity distribution networks had been damaged by shelling in the Donetsk and Kherson regions. Authorities in the Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia have begun evacuating villages near the frontline. The Russian-installed governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, announced the move in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive aimed at retaking the area, claiming Kyiv’s forces had “stepped up shelling of settlements close to the frontline” in the past few days. Engineers have reduced the risk of a dam bursting and damaging the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a senior Russian official was quoted by state news agency Tass as saying on Friday. Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the general director of energy engineering firm Rosenergoatom, said specialists had begun discharging water from the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam on the Dnieper River in southern Ukraine. A Moscow court has ordered the arrest of a theatre director and a playwright on charges of “justifying terrorism” over an award-winning play about Russian women recruited online to marry radical Islamists in Syria. Director Yevgeniya Berkovich and author Svetlana Petriychuk were placed in custody until 4 July, Russian news agencies reported. Bill Clinton has said he knew in 2011 it was just “a matter of time” before the Russian president attacked Ukraine. “Vladimir Putin told me in 2011 – three years before he took Crimea – that he did not agree with the agreement I made with Boris Yeltsin,” the former US president recalled. “He said … ‘I don’t agree with it. And I do not support it. And I am not bound by it.’ And I knew from that day forward it was just a matter of time.” That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Nicola Slawson will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Russia has been accused of attacking the besieged city of Bakhmut with incendiary phosphorus weapons, BBC News reported. Ukraine’s military shared drone footage of what appeared to show Bakhmut ablaze as white phosphorus rains down on the city. BBC News reported: White phosphorus weapons are not banned, but their use in civilian areas is considered a war crime. They create fast-spreading fires that are very difficult to put out. Russia has been accused of using them before. Russia has been trying to capture Bakhmut for months, despite its questionable strategic value. Western officials have estimated that thousands of Moscow’s troops have died in the assault. On Twitter, Ukraine’s defence ministry said the attack had targeted “unoccupied areas of Bakhmut with incendiary ammunition”. It added: Not enough shells, but more than enough phosphorus. The price of liberation is high. In the village of Posad-Pokrovske in southern Ukraine, a place once on the very frontline of the war, almost every house is damaged by shell fire. Outside a blue-painted church, Father Viktor Kravchuk, 61, has laid out the sheets, quilts and clothes he has rescued from his ruined house to air in front a little cemetery that is a tangle of blossoming lilac. Mykola Barkov, a volunteer, helps Kravchuk clear out a ruined room with a sagging, broken ceiling where, before the war, the priest hosted his church group meetings. Kravchuk tells the story of the village, describing the brief Russian occupation there at the beginning of the war – how after the Russians were pushed out, the village became a frontline position for Ukraine’s soldiers, who were hit by Russian shells for months. Russia is still not satisfied with how the issue of Russian agricultural exports as part of the Black Sea grain deal is being resolved, Tass news agency quoted deputy foreign minister Sergey Vershinin as saying on Saturday after the latest talks with a top UN official. “We are still not satisfied with the progress. This is very important for us,” Vershinin said. He was speaking after talks in Moscow with the United Nations’ top trade official Rebeca Grynspan, Tass said. A mock-up depicting Russian president, Vladimir Putin, hangs from a road sign, which reads ‘Avdiivka is Ukraine’, in the town of Avdiivka, near a frontline in Donetsk region. More on the pro-Kremlin writer and army veteran Zakhar Prilepin who was injured in a car “explosion” on Saturday. One other person in the car was killed, according to the Russian interior ministry. He had been travelling with his family, Russian authorities reported. State-run news agencies said his legs have been injured, Agence France-Presse reports. “According to initial reports, one person was killed by the explosion, and the writer Zakhar Prilepin, who was in the car, was injured” in the Nizhny Novgorod region about 400km (250 miles) east of Moscow, the ministry said. Prilepin, 47, one of Russia’s best-known novelists, joined pro-Russian separatists in the east of Ukraine in 2014, and fought by their side. A Chechnya war veteran, he has regularly gone to eastern Ukraine and is a vocal supporter of Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and of his February 2022 offensive. The incident comes after a series of apparent attacks and sabotage on Russian territory, sometimes far from the front. In April a blast from a statuette rigged with explosives killed 40-year-old pro-Kremlin military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky. And last August Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent ultranationalist intellectual, was killed in a car bombing outside Moscow, which Russia blamed on Ukraine. Kyiv denied the charges. Ukraine has sent first lady, Olena Zelenska, and Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, as the country’s representatives to UK’s King Charles’s coronation in London on Saturday. Zelenska posted on her official Facebook: “It is an honour for us and Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal to attend the coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla The royal family here at Westminster Abbey to wish on behalf of all of Ukraine successful governance and prosperity to the country.” The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has not yet responded to proposals from United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, on the Black Sea grain deal, Tass news agency quoted the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, as saying. The situation around the deal was “not improving for now”, it quoted him as saying. In April, the UN chief asked the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to deliver to Putin a letter proposing a “way forward aimed at the improvement, extension and expansion” of the deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukrainian grain, Reuters reported. A prominent Russian nationalist writer, Zakhar Prilepin, was wounded in a car bombing in the region of Nizhny Novgorod on Saturday, the Russian state news agency Tass said, in an attack that Russia immediately blamed on Ukraine and the West. Tass quoted a source in the emergency services as saying the writer’s car was blown up. “He survived, but was wounded and is conscious,” the source was quoted as saying. No further details were immediately available. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram: The fact has come true: Washington and Nato fed another international terrorist cell – the Kyiv regime. She said it was the “direct responsibility of the US and Britain”, but provided no evidence to support the accusation. “We pray for Zakhar,” she added. Ukraine’s air force has claimed to have downed a Russian hypersonic missile over Kyiv using newly acquired American Patriot defence systems, the first known time the country has been able to intercept one of Moscow’s most modern missiles. Air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk said in a Telegram post that the Kinzhal-type ballistic missile had been intercepted in an overnight attack on the Ukrainian capital earlier in the week. It was also the first time Ukraine is known to have used the Patriot defence systems. “Yes, we shot down the ‘unique’ Kinzhal,” Oleshchuk wrote. “It happened during the night time attack on 4 May in the skies of the Kyiv region.” Oleshchuk said the Kh-47 missile was launched by a MiG-31K aircraft from the Russian territory and was shot down with a Patriot missile, AP reported. The Kinzhal is one of the latest and most advanced Russian weapons. The Russian military says the air-launched ballistic missile has a range of up to 2,000km (about 1,250 miles) and flies at 10 times the speed of sound, making it hard to intercept. A combination of hypersonic speed and a heavy warhead allows the Kinzhal to destroy heavily fortified targets, like underground bunkers or mountain tunnels. The Ukrainian military has previously admitted lacking assets to intercept the Kinzhals. Ukraine took its first delivery of the Patriot missiles in late April. It has not specified how many of the systems it has, but they have been provided by the US, Germany and the Netherlands. Germany has acknowledged sending at least one system and the Netherlands has said it has provided two. Poland will demand European Union sanctions on imports of Russian farm products, its ambassador to the EU Andrzej Sadoś was quoted as saying by PAP news agency. “Europe isn’t threatened by disruptions in supply chain of farm products now, contrary, we have a problem of surpluses. We are resolving a problem of increased imports of farm products from Ukraine,” Sadoś said, according to PAP. The European Commission earlier this week set restrictions until 5 June on imports of Ukrainian wheat, maize, rapeseed and sunflower seed to ease the excess supply of these commodities in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last year, the EU has adopted 10 sanctions packages against Russian individuals and companies, Reuters reported. Poland in April proposed a new set of punitive measures against Moscow, including a ban on pipeline oil and diamond imports. The FT’s correspondent Christopher Miller has shared a video of what appears to be Russian forces attacking the city of Bakhmut with incendiary weapons. He tweeted: Video from Ukraine’s special operations forces purportedly showing Russian forces blanketing the embattled city of Bakhmut with incendiary weapons. Switzerland’s parliament has approved a request from Ukrainian authorities for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address it. The invitation, announced in a statement late on Friday, comes amid pressure on Switzerland’s government to break with a centuries-old tradition of neutrality and end a ban of exports of Swiss weapons to conflict zones such as Ukraine. So far, the government has refused to change this policy, Reuters reported. The subject of Zelenskiy’s address, which will the first by video by a foreign leader to the legislature, is unknown. It is scheduled for the summer session beginning on 30 May. During that session, lawmakers are also set to weigh a motion to provide 5bn Swiss Francs ($5.6bn) of support to Ukraine over five to 10 years. Concerns in the Russian leadership about its vulnerability to attacks and the potential for public protests over the Ukraine war have contributed to the decision to cancel many Victory Day parades, citing security concerns, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its latest intelligence briefing, the ministry said six Russian regions, occupied Crimea and 21 cities had cancelled their parades on Tuesday marking the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. The ministry said: The timing of the UAV [drone] strike on the Kremlin a few days before Victory Day shows Russia’s increasing vulnerability to such attacks and has almost certainly raised the threat perception of the Russian leadership over the Victory Day events. The potential for protests and discontent over the Ukraine war are also likely to have influenced the calculus of the Russian leadership. Moscow’s Victory Day celebration was likely to go ahead but on a smaller scale, said the briefing, posted on Twitter, while the reception for the president, Vladimir Putin, after the parade would not. Kherson’s weekend curfew is the latest inconvenience for residents who, after enduring months of Russian occupation last year, have been subjected to daily bombardments by Russian troops encamped nearby on the other side of the River Dnipro. Despite their retreat from Kherson city last November, Russian forces still hold large swathes of territory in the wider Kherson region that Ukraine wants to recapture, Reuters reports. Russian shelling on Wednesday killed 23 people in Kherson city, and attacks on Ukrainian-controlled parts of the Kherson region continued on Friday, regional authorities said. Some residents left Kherson in cars and buses on Friday while others stocked up on groceries before a 56-hour curfew began on Friday evening in the southern Ukrainian city. Reuters reports that the announcement of the curfew, lasting until Monday morning, prompted speculation in Kherson that the city was about to be used as a launch point for Ukraine’s much-anticipated counterattack. Iryna Chupryna, a former real estate manager, said: Everybody understands it [the curfew]. It means it is necessary for our military. Some residents said they left because they were scared, others because they did not want to spend most of the weekend indoors. Local authorities gave little away about the reason for the curfew, beyond saying it was intended to enable law enforcement agencies to “conduct their activities in Kherson”. No one will be allowed to enter or exit the city during the curfew, and residents must limit their movements to short walks outside their homes. Strikes on Russian infrastructure including drone attacks on refineries and train sabotage have multiplied in recent weeks, with experts suggesting they are part of Ukraine’s preparations for an expected spring offensive. Agence France-Presse reports that Kyiv has not claimed any of the acts denounced by Moscow as Ukrainian “sabotage” of “unprecedented momentum”, but the majority appear to target Russian army supply chains in border regions and in annexed Crimea, a base for Russian troops. Mykhailo Samus, deputy director of the Centre for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies in Kyiv, said: All of this was done to prepare for an offensive. I am sure that the intensity [of the attacks] will increase. A senior Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously, said that “these are standard measures for limiting the capabilities of the Russian armed forces”. Oil facilities – essential for supplying the troops – appear to be the priority targets of the attacks, which have been generally carried out with drones. The list of incidents has expanded on a near daily basis. On Thursday, a drone was shot down near an airbase in Sevastopol in the Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. That same day, Russia’s southern Krasnodar and Rostov regions, both near Ukraine, reported drone strikes that caused fires. On Friday, another fire broke out at the same oil refinery in Krasnodar. Over the past week, two fuel depots also caught fire, in and around Crimea, while last weekend an overnight Ukrainian strike on the Russian border village of Suzemka left four dead. Also in Russia’s Bryansk region bordering Ukraine, two freight trains derailed earlier this week after explosive devices went off on the tracks. Hello and welcome back to our coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war, now in its 437th day. I’m Adam Fulton and let’s begin with a rundown of the latest events. Increasing attacks on Russian infrastructure in recent weeks are part of Ukraine’s preparations for its long-anticipated spring offensive, experts suggest. The majority of the strikes appear to be targeting Russian army supply chains in border regions and in annexed Crimea, a base for Russian forces. In the southern city of Kherson, meanwhile, a 56-hour curfew began on Friday evening and some residents left the city after the curfew announcement prompted speculation that it was about to be used as a launching point for Ukraine’s counterattack. More on those stories shortly. In other news as it turns 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv: The leader of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force has said his forces will leave Bakhmut, which they have been trying to capture since last summer. Yevgeny Prigozhin said they would pull back on Wednesday 10 May – ending their involvement in the war’s longest battle – because of heavy losses and inadequate ammunition supplies, and he asked defence chiefs to put regular army troops in their place. But Ukraine said Wagner fighters were reinforcing positions to try to seize the eastern city before that date. Prigozhin earlier released a video showing him standing in a field of Russian corpses and blaming defence chiefs for the losses suffered by his fighters in Ukraine, appearing to reignite his simmering feud with Russian top brass. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has carried out an inspection of troop readiness for forces engaged in the war, in an apparent coded response to Prigozhin’s criticism.

Even so, the striking feature – beyond the well-trailed two-year price cap for households – was how much has been filed under “to do” or “details to follow”. At least six areas of the canvas are virtually blank. First, six months of “equivalent” support for businesses, public sector bodies and charities inevitably prompts the question of what happens in April. On what basis will deserving causes for ongoing help be selected? Second, negotiations with electricity generators – mainly nuclear power plants and wind and solar projects – to reduce their prices seem barely to have started. The principle of switching firms to contracts-for-difference is fine (for reasons discussed in this column previously) but success will be determined solely by how low prices can be made to fall. With wholesale prices at £400-ish per megawatt hour, some generators’ windfall profits will be enormous. Would a good outcome for taxpayers be a contracted price close to £40, which is roughly where the last capacity auction came out? Or, given that lucrative old-style “renewables obligations certificates” have obvious value, are we talking £100 as a realistic goal? The difference matters hugely if new contracts could run as long as 15 years. Ministers can’t negotiate in public but it’s hard to detect any sense that the Treasury itself knows where it is aiming. The scheme, in essence, is the alternative to Labour’s idea for an extended windfall tax and ministers must be muscular: this should be a “negotiation” in the sense that generators are told, more or less, the definition of a fair price. Third, will the Treasury’s joint £40bn liquidity support scheme with the Bank of England, due to be launched “by the end of October or sooner”, arrive in time? Anecdotal evidence suggests pips are squeaking among power firms as they attempt to sign collateral-backed hedging contracts in the wholesale market. It would be embarrassing, to put it mildly, if replacing Ofgem’s price cap leads to more corporate failures. The situation does not need more Bulbs. Fourth, the terms of reference for the new “Energy Supply Taskforce” need to be clear. The government is underwriting, in effect, the gas and electricity purchases of private companies so it needs to know that contracts are being signed on hard commercial terms. There is an obvious risk that the odd billion slips between the cracks. Fifth, while “fundamental reforms to the structure and regulation of the energy market” are desperately needed, there’s no hint of quick wins. One of Ofgem’s many failures was the regulator’s inability to spot that coupling the price of electricity to the price of gas would cause trouble one day. A review of that outdated pricing set-up is already under way, but needs to be accelerated. Sixth, there was nothing new on measures to improve energy efficiency, even though cries for a mass-insulation programme for public buildings and council houses have been heard for months. A public information campaign is better than nothing, but other European countries have been on the job for ages. On the plus side, the domestic price cap, for all its imperfections (untargeted and of unknowable expense), provides households with certainty this winter. And Truss has swallowed her free-market instincts and understood that intervention at the wholesale end of the energy market must be part of the same deal. It is impossible, though, to avoid the conclusion that the plan would have fewer gaps if big decisions had been made months ago. A long summer of Tory leadership larks has had consequences. Melrose has work to do Melrose Industries’ private equity-style mantra is “buy, improve, sell”. After acquiring GKN, the grand but misfiring FTSE 100 automotive and aerospace engineer, in a bitter battle in 2018, it reckons it’s a long way down the track with the improvement part of exercise. Operations-wise, GKN looks fitter. Finding buyers, however, is proving tricky. Thus there will be a demerger in London next year of the automotive business. In commercial terms, a split makes sense. The two halves of GKN have always looked destined to go different ways eventually, and separation allows both companies to hunt for bolt-on acquisitions. But, as a way to “unlock value for shareholders” – the other ambition – there is work to do. Melrose’s shares fell 9%. It was a reminder that, in the end, the private equity model requires a crystallisation event, in deal-making lingo. A demerger doesn’t qualify on that score."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-316-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-05T19:59:16Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: What we know on day 316 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-316-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-316-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: What we know on day 316 of the invasion","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has instructed his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to introduce a 36-hour ceasefire along the entire line of contact in Ukraine from noon on Friday to midnight on Saturday, the Kremlin has said. Russian troops must hold fire for 36 hours to allow people “in the areas of hostilities” to mark Orthodox Christmas, the Russian leader said. Putin’s announcement came hours after the head of the Russian Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, called for a ceasefire and a Christmas truce in Ukraine. In a statement, Kirill said he appealed to “all parties involved in the internecine conflict” for the ceasefire, so that “Orthodox people can attend services on Christmas Eve and the day of the nativity of Christ”. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior aide to Ukraine’s president, dismissed Putin’s calls for a temporary ceasefire to mark Orthodox Christmas. He said a “temporary truce” would be possible only when Russia leaves territory it is occupying in Ukraine. Other Ukrainian politicians said Russia’s offer of a ceasefire came just days after it launched a wave of strikes on Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, as Ukrainians celebrated the new year. Putin is “trying to find some oxygen” by floating a 36-hour ceasefire to mark Orthodox Christmas, said Joe Biden. “I’m reluctant to respond [to] anything Putin says,” Biden told reporters. “I found it interesting. He was ready to bomb hospitals and nurseries and churches on the 25th and new year.” Prior to the ceasefire announcement, Putin told his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Russia was open to dialogue over Ukraine but Kyiv would have to accept the “new territorial realities”, according to a readout of the call between the two leaders issued by the Kremlin. Putin also “acknowledged the destructive role of the west, pumping weapons into Kyiv, providing information and guidance”, the Kremlin said. Putin and Erdoğan also discussed a number of energy issues, including the creation of a gas hub in Turkey and the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, it added. Erdoğan told Putin during the call on Thursday that peace efforts in the Russia-Ukraine war should be supported by a unilateral ceasefire and a “vision for a fair solution”, the Turkish presidency said in its readout of the call. The two leaders discussed energy and the Black Sea grain corridor, and Erdoğan told Putin concrete steps needed to be taken to clear Kurdish militants from the Syrian border region, it added. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also spoke with Turkey’s leader about “security cooperation” as well as the exchange of prisoners of war and the Black Sea grain initiative, Zelenskiy said. He added he was “glad to hear that Turkey is ready to participate in the implementation” of his “peace formula”, which he first proposed in November. The first inmates recruited by the private military group Wagner have received their promised pardons after fighting for six months in Ukraine, Wagner’s founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, told journalists on Thursday. “They worked off their contract. They worked with honour, with dignity. They were the first ones. Nobody else in this world works as hard as they did,” Prigozhin told the Russian news agency RIA-Novosti, standing alongside a number of former convicts. Addressing the former prisoners, Prigozhin instructed them not to end up back in jail. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk oblast – one of the regions the Russian Federation claims to have annexed – has posted a status update in which he says two people have been killed by Russian fire in the last 24 hours. Overnight, Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), has said that service personnel injured in the attack on the barracks in occupied Makiivka have been mostly transferred to hospitals within Russia. Ukraine’s gross domestic product fell by 30.4% in 2022 – the largest annual fall in more than 30 years – because of the war with Russia, the economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said. She said Ukraine’s economy had suffered its largest losses since it won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 although the fall was less than initially expected. Ukraine’s GDP had grown by 3.4% in 2021. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France would send light AMX-10 RC armoured combat vehicles, an Elysée official said after a phone call between Macron and Zelenskiy. In a video address, during which he thanked France for providing them, the Ukrainian president said: “This is what gives a clear signal to all our other partners. There is no rational reason why western-style tanks have not yet been supplied to Ukraine.” The provision of tanks may well be part of “the next phase” of weapons transfers to Ukraine, the UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said after a meeting in London with Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, on Thursday. Speaking at a joint press conference with Baerbock, Cleverly said the position on the provision of tanks is kept under constant review. A wide-ranging public discussion is taking place in Ukraine over what to do with seven street murals painted in November by the British artist Banksy on a series of destroyed buildings in and around Kyiv. The conversation has grown urgent after thieves last month made off with one artwork from the town of Hostomel, about 15 miles (25km) outside the capital. It shows a woman in a gas mask and dressing gown holding a red fire extinguisher. She is standing next to a real flame-blackened window. The US is not “hand-wringing” over the mass casualties of Russian soldiers in a Ukrainian attack reportedly using US-supplied artillery, a senior White House official said on Wednesday. After criticism in Russia over the use of US-delivered weaponry by Ukrainian defenders, including in the Makiivka strike, the national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said Russia is to blame. Biden said the US was considering sending Bradley Fighting Vehicles to Ukraine. The armoured vehicle with a powerful gun has been used as a staple by the US army to carry troops around battlefields since the mid-1980s. The US is also looking at ways to target Iranian drone production through sanctions and export controls, the White House said. Washington previously imposed sanctions on companies and people it accused of producing or transferring Iranian drones that Russia has used against Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry on Wednesday blamed the illegal use of mobile phones by its soldiers for a deadly Ukrainian missile strike that it said killed 89 servicemen, raising the reported death toll significantly. Moscow previously said 63 Russian soldiers were killed in the weekend strike on Makiivka. Although an official investigation has been launched, the main reason for the attack was clearly the illegal mass use of mobile phones by servicemen, the ministry said. “This factor allowed the enemy to track and determine the coordinates of the soldiers’ location for a missile strike,” it said in a statement issued just after 1am in Moscow on Wednesday. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister said significant Russian losses meant Moscow would probably have to announce a second partial mobilisation in the first quarter of the year. Further strikes deep in Russian territory should be expected, the head of the Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, has told the US TV network ABC. He said the attacks would come “deeper and deeper” inside Russia, without specifically saying whether Ukraine would be behind them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/23/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-181-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T00:14:53Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 181 of the invasion ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/23/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-181-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/23/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-181-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 181 of the invasion ","bodyText":"Russia has accused Ukraine’s intelligence services of carrying out the murder of Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue. Russia’s FSB security service published information and a video it said showed a Ukrainian woman from the country’s Azov regiment was responsible for the murder. The Guardian reports the claim lacks credibility. The UN’s secretary-general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling” on Monday, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. Moscow has requested a UN security council meeting be held on Tuesday to discuss the Zaporizhzhia plant, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported, citing deputy ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy. Ukrainian soldiers who were taken prisoner after the battle for Mariupol have accused Russian forces of torture during their captivity. The soldiers, who were from the Azov regiment and released as part of a prisoner exchange, told reporters they saw soldiers that were beaten until their bones were broken. “Some had needles inserted into their wounds, some were tortured with water,” said Vladyslav Zhaivoronok, who lost a leg. “They undressed us, forced to squat while we are naked. If any of the boys raised their heads, they began to beat them immediately,” added Denys Chepurko. The sole bridge across the strategic Dnieper River in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson was reportedly hit by US-supplied high-precision Himars rockets injuring 15 people, a source told Russia’s Interfax news agency. The bridge is a key crossing for Russian military transport in the region. Three villages in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region were battered by Russian artillery and multiple rocket launchers on Monday. Soledar, Zaytseve and Bilohorivka near the city of Bakhmut were struck, killing at least two civilians, Ukrainian authorities said. Nearly 9,000 Ukrainian military personnel have been killed in the war with Russia, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, general Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said on Monday. The office of the UN high commissioner for human rights said on Monday 5,587 civilians had been killed and 7,890 wounded between 24 February and 21 August, mainly from artillery, rocket and missile attacks. The US has rejected Ukraine’s call for a blanket ban on visas for Russians, saying Washington would not want to close off pathways to refuge for Russia’s dissidents and others who are vulnerable to human rights abuses. The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, also said he opposes a complete ban on visas for Russians. The German chancellor says he is working fast to find alternatives to Russian gas. Olaf Scholz said he aims to extricate Germany from its dependence on Russian gas and pursue new energy supplies. Scholz met Canada’s prime minster, Justin Trudeau, in Montreal on Monday. The two leaders are set to sign a deal for Canada to supply clean hydrogen to Germany. Ukraine has restored a rail link to neighbouring Moldova which could carry 10m tonnes of freight a year, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The 22km (12 mile) line runs from western Ukraine to Moldova. Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksander Kubrakov, said the link would provide an alternative route from the Black Sea port of Odesa. Ukraine’s agricultural exports are likely to rise to about 4m tonnes in August, from 3m tonnes in July, a deputy chair of the Ukrainian agrarian council said. The uptick is due to a UN-brokered deal that unblocked Ukrainian seaports. Europe faces fresh disruption to energy supplies due to damage to a pipeline system bringing oil from Kazakhstan through Russia that was reported by the pipeline operator on Monday. Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) said exports from two of its three mooring points at a Black Sea terminal had been suspended. A senior Russian diplomat has ruled out a diplomatic solution to ending the war in Ukraine. Gennady Gatilov, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, told the Financial Times that there would be no direct talks between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, adding that Moscow expects a prolonged conflict."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/02/morning-mail-rba-rate-warning-thousands-miss-power-bill-rebates-four-day-work-week-trial","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-01T19:56:46Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: RBA rate warning, thousands miss power bill rebates, four-day work week trial ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/02/morning-mail-rba-rate-warning-thousands-miss-power-bill-rebates-four-day-work-week-trial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/02/morning-mail-rba-rate-warning-thousands-miss-power-bill-rebates-four-day-work-week-trial","fields":{"headline":"Morning Mail: RBA rate warning, thousands miss power bill rebates, four-day work week trial ","bodyText":"Morning everyone.

Plumes of smoke were seen rising from the Sevastopol military base on Saturday morning, and city residents were urged to stay at home immediately after the strike, the latest in a string of high-profile attacks on sensitive targets there and inside Russia. The governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhaev, said there were no casualties, and initially claimed the drone flew into the airbase’s roof after troops stationed there were not able to shoot it down. He later said soldiers had been able to target the drone, and that it had fallen onto the airbase roof after being hit. “Clarification: the drone was hit...right above the fleet headquarters. It fell on the roof and caught fire. The attack failed. Well done boys,” he wrote. Previous attacks in Crimea, including one earlier this month on the Saky airbase that sent fireballs into the sky and destroyed nine or more warplanes, prompted many residents to flee the peninsula. Worried locals responded to Razvozhaev by asking how a drone had slipped through air defences that at the start of the war were considered among the most sophisticated in the world. “Was our air defence system on a lunch break?” asked one. “When will you finally close the city?” asked another, suggesting the attacks were the work of pro-Ukraine partisans in the peninsula. “We fought harder against the coronavirus! There were checkposts everywhere then, now anyone and everyone enters!!!!” Another wondered if more attacks were coming. Wednesday 24 August is Ukraine’s independence day, and will also mark six months since Russia’s invasion. Many in the country are worried that Moscow may be preparing some kind of major attack that day, but residents in Crimea are also apparently concerned that Ukraine wants to mark its successful resistance. “They have Independence Day on the 24th, maybe they are preparing something? And the [drone] is just to divert attention from the main thing.” The attacks came a day after the US announced a $775m arms package for Ukraine including drones, armoured vehicles and artillery. Government officials have repeatedly said that while western weapons allowed the country to save Kyiv, and hold off Russia in other areas, they are still woefully short of the arms needed to decisively defeat Russia. Promised supplies are also arriving slowly. Last week a senior source estimated only 10% of arms promised by the west had reached Ukraine. And on Saturday presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak warned Moscow was trying to create a “reputation crisis” for Ukraine that would slow the flow of western arms. Ukrainian troops are being pounded by weapons in the south and in the east, where Russian forces are still slowly advancing through a wasteland of cities shelled into ruin before they are captured. On Saturday they stepped up fighting to seize Bakhmut, one of the last major towns in the Donetsk region still held by Ukrainian forces, and which would clear the way for Russia to move on two other strategic targets, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Russia last month took over all of the Luhansk region, which together with Donetsk makes up the industrial Donbas heartland. Russia-backed separatists self-declared a pair of independent republics there. After Russia’s failure to seize Kyiv, and setbacks in parts of the south including around the city of Kherson, capturing territory here has become a key military objective for Moscow. Shelling in the Mykolaiv region also seriously injured four children and five adults, with one girl losing an eye, said governor Vitaliy Kim. Shells landed in the town of Voznesensk, just 30km from the country’s second-largest nuclear power plant. There is growing global concern about Russia’s occupation of the nearby Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest in Europe, and suspicion that Russian authorities could try to disconnect it from the Ukrainian grid, which would raise the risk of a nuclear accident.

Fewer opportunities to speak Welsh at home and school, coupled with a long-term trend of people migrating from Wales, have caused a decline in the number of Welsh speakers. A recent Office for National Statistics estimate indicates that about 895,000 people speak Welsh, but a lower figure is expected when the 2021 census data is published, on 6 December. Now, another factor is contributing to the decline of the Welsh language: the steady rise of second homes. It’s easy to see why Wales, with its stunning coastline and rural landscapes, has become a favoured location for holiday homes. But the growth in second homes is having a corrosive effect on the Welsh language. In some places, the concentration of second homes is so high that up to 46% of the local housing stock can be empty for parts of the year. In places like Gwynedd, one in every ten homes is a second home. According to government figures, there are currently 23, 974 second homes in Wales. This figure is likely to be an underestimate, as many homes are used as short-term, self-catering accommodation. Because these homes are registered as businesses, they do not appear on council tax lists. The rise of second homes is contributing to rising house prices. This is pushing out many younger Welsh speakers, who feel understandably aggrieved that they have to leave their home communities. As more communities become places for holiday lets, rural and village schools close. This in turn weakens the predominance of Welsh as the default language in particular communities, causing the “anglicisation” of Welsh-speaking towns and villages, according to Simon Brooks, chair of the Commission for Welsh-speaking Communities. Geography and place matter for language. Once a minority language is no longer spoken on the street, at school, or in social and community life, its resonance changes. A language instead becomes rooted in the education system as a skill to be acquired, rather than a spoken part of everyday life. Without opportunities to speak Welsh on a daily basis as part of a community, Welsh speakers may find themselves less able or confident about initiating conversations in Welsh – particularly when they’re dealing with the health service, the government and other services. The case for preserving a Welsh-speaking heartland has been in the public consciousness since the 1920s. More recently, campaigns by the Cymdeithas yr Iaith (the Welsh Language Society) have spearheaded the fight for language rights while tying the Welsh language to a broader set of social and economic issues, seeing the preservation of Welsh as the key to preventing the erosion of communities and quality of life. Inspired by ecological and cultural preservation movements, a raft of recent proposals has attempted to counter the decline of Welsh. Planning policies allow local authorities to consider the Welsh language in planning decisions (the Horizon nuclear power proposal on Anglesey was subject to both an environmental assessment and a Welsh language assessment). Given the rapid rise in housing costs and lack of affordable housing, these planning policies need updating. They could, for example, give a higher weighting to developments that strengthen the survival of the Welsh language, or allocate more resources to local authority programmes that would preserve the language, tackle poverty and improve the services available to Welsh-speaking communities. The Commission for Welsh Speaking Communities was established earlier this year by the Welsh government. It will publish its first report in 2024, and will probably recommend that homeowners obtain planning permission to change their property into a second home. Another proposal could be a variable tax of up to 300% on second homes in particular areas. In addition to this, the Welsh government could strengthen some of the initiatives in community-led housing, such as community ownership models that would transfer property and land to local housing associations or social enterprises, helping to alleviate the housing crisis. A more radical policy would involve offering tax incentives to encourage people to remain in their areas, or to encourage Welsh-speaking newcomers to move into “threatened” areas. Farmers have been paid levies to nurture endangered landscapes, so why not pay Welsh speakers a similar levy to move to an endangered community and help keep the language alive? Despite the erosion of Welsh-speaking communities in north and west Wales, there is still plenty to be hopeful about. Cardiff’s council leader, Huw Thomas, has committed to establishing more Welsh-speaking schools and offering more classes taught in Welsh at English-speaking schools. In other authority areas, there are plans to create Welsh streams in English-speaking schools and to open dual language schools. Meanwhile, initiatives such as the Canolfan Dysgu Cymraeg Cenedlaethol’s (National Centre for Learning Welsh)“Siarad” scheme pairs new speakers with proficient native speakers, giving language learners informal opportunities to mix in places where Welsh is dominant. Many people learning Welsh are likely to see the language as a utilitarian skill they need in order to get a job in particular sectors, rather than as a language for social interaction. To show why Welsh is an important foundation for people living in and contributing to Welsh society, we need leadership and inspiration. Linguistic and community decline is not inevitable. Given the national and local will, there’s no reason we can’t safeguard the Welsh language for future generations. Colin Williams is a professor at Cardiff University’s School of Welsh and a senior research associate at Cambridge University • This article was amended on 24 November 2022.

He underestimated Ukrainian resilience and European readiness to punish Kremlin aggression with sanctions. That forced Mr Putin into a longer game. Now he is betting that European reliance on Russian gas exports will corrode western solidarity, leading to a degrading of sanctions and restored tolerance of Moscow’s territorial aggressions. To hasten that scenario, Russia has cut the flow of gas through the main east-west pipeline. The Kremlin’s message of strategic extortion is not subtle: go softer on the war and have a cosier winter; stay tough and freeze. European solidarity is just about holding. Earlier this week EU members agreed a deal to cut gas usage by 15% as part of a phased move away from reliance on Russian supplies. But the deal is diluted by opt-outs and exceptions for various countries. Hungary, the EU state that is cosiest with the Kremlin, has not signed up at all. The view in Brussels is that energy security is an issue that proves the importance of transnational collaboration and should add momentum to political, economic and strategic integration. That is true in theory. In practice, it brings new tensions between member states and aggravates old ones. Spain, for example, has invested in infrastructure to help it diversify its energy supply in ways that Germany has not. Viewed from Madrid, the demand for solidarity looks like a tax on foresight to pay for Berlin’s longstanding complacency about the strategic threat from Russia. French power supplies are mostly nuclear, but President Macron is an avowed European integrationist who fears a wider threat to the eurozone if the German economy is damaged by soaring gas bills. It is not only German consumers who are facing a shock. The country’s politicians are struggling to adapt to the new reality in which an attitude to Russia that they proudly thought of as reasonable and diplomatic now looks like a colossal geostrategic blunder. That vulnerability is compounded by Germany’s decision, in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima accident in Japan, to phase out all nuclear power use. The wisdom of that move is also being queried. The long-term solution to this challenge is clear enough. It requires an accelerated transition to renewable energy sources, which has the additional benefit of being something Europe and the rest of the world urgently needs to do anyway in order to avert a climate catastrophe. But pressures of the short term push in the opposite direction – towards reviving dirty coal-burning power plants and deals with other nasty authoritarian states that have hydrocarbon resources to export. Most dangerous is the way rising fuel bills bolster the school of populist denial that says the transition to green energy is an unaffordable luxury at a time of rising inflation and slower growth. That argument already has a purchase in many European countries. It is not yet a prominent feature of the current Tory leadership contest but it is there, cultivated by backbenchers and imposing a reluctance on the candidates to commit wholeheartedly to any meaningful green agenda. That is a symptom of dismal strategic myopia. Mr Putin’s cynical weaponisation of gas supplies makes the case for a new energy paradigm every bit as eloquently as the most passionate advocate of idealistic environmentalism – and in terms that speak to a more conservative audience. There are few win-win propositions in global affairs. But one that could be embraced as a cross-party consensus is the green energy route that simultaneously breaks the Kremlin’s pernicious influence and slashes carbon emissions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/sep/06/ingrid-pollard-three-drops-of-blood-review-honiton","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-06T10:16:01Z","webTitle":"Ingrid Pollard: Three Drops of Blood review – finding magic and myths among the ferns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/sep/06/ingrid-pollard-three-drops-of-blood-review-honiton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/sep/06/ingrid-pollard-three-drops-of-blood-review-honiton","fields":{"headline":"Ingrid Pollard: Three Drops of Blood review – finding magic and myths among the ferns","bodyText":"With the opening of her survey show, Carbon Slowly Turning, at MK Gallery in March (now running at Turner Contemporary, Margate, until 25 September), 2022 had already shaped up as a major year in the career of photographer and visual artist Ingrid Pollard. Then in April she was nominated for the Turner prize, commended by a jury “struck by bold new developments” in her recent work as well as for the way she has “for decades […] uncovered stories and histories hidden in plain sight”. In works ranging from The Cost of the English Landscape (1989), which connected romantic visions of the Lake District with references to the slave trade and nuclear power production at Sellafield, to Landscape Trauma (2001), where the geological structures of Northumbrian rock formations are writ large on vast photographic panels, Pollard has, for more than 40 years, reflected the inadequacy of simplistic narratives about England’s landscape and in contrast offered an artistic vision of engagement with the natural world that grasps, above all, its movement and complexity. A new series of kinetic sculptures will, in this vein, crown her contribution to the Turner prize exhibition that opens at Tate Liverpool in October. Until then, perhaps the best evidence around that here is an artist who, at 69, is only now coming into the peak of her creative powers, is to be found off the beaten track, at the Thelma Hulbert Gallery in Honiton, east Devon, where a new solo show, Three Drops of Blood, brings together Pollard’s recent engagement with 19th-century botanical collections and East Devon’s history as a former world centre of lace-manufacturing with her own enduring concern with questions of race and the legacies of empire. Curated by Devon-based Talking on Corners (AKA Ella S Mills, whose art historical research has focused on female figures of the British Black Arts Movements including Pollard, Sonia Boyce, Lubaina Himid and Claudette Johnson), the exhibition marks the culmination of two years’ research by Pollard across the county including at the Devon and Exeter Institution where, among other details, she unearthed folk histories of the fern. This element runs through the show connecting perfect reproductions of xylotheks – wooden boxes used for storing tree specimens – and classification-photography, with contemporary reflections by the Antiguan American writer Jamaica Kincaid on communing with people and plants in the Himalayas, and of ways other than colonial adventure of being in the world. The fern, it transpires, is part of our ancient landscape, dating back more than 300m years, and predating even the advent of dinosaurs, to the Carboniferous period. Its reproduction was for centuries a mystery – no flowers or pods – inspiring beliefs of magical agency. It was said, for example, that anyone who held invisible fern seeds would be invisible too, and that by shooting them into the sun with an arrow on midsummer’s day, three drops of blood would fall and anyone who caught the drops would “gain knowledge of all things” and could keep the devil at bay. This poetic resonance in the title also points to the way that imagination, in Pollard’s latest work, emerges as the substance that holds so many disparate elements together, transfiguring and transforming. Where a younger Pollard’s sometimes harsh, often ironic, juxtaposition of images or text and image, might lead us headlong into a chasm of contradiction that can be discerned in the heart of Englishness and England’s cultural mythology, here she emerges as a master of synthesis and humanism. She draws out the invisible threads that connect landscapes and histories and establishes a sense of liberated being that moves freely within space and time. Anonymous portraits of Africans, for example, are rescued from the pages of antiquarian books. While once these images may have spoken, through Pollard, to the violence of black voices erased by the colonial archive, here they are recast on black fabric patterned with white polka dots and become the centre of a visual dance that stimulates the eye and makes the spirit soar. An experience of transcendence is conveyed, bearing out Pollard’s own claim, in a text that accompanies the exhibition (drawing on a conversation with Sussex professor Divya P Tolia-Kelly), that this is “the most kind of dreamy piece of work” she’s ever done. Like a dream, it renders things forgotten and unseen and it lands with a sense of sublime restitution.

The Coryton complex in Essex dates back to 1895, and its use has changed over the years. Behind the lions loom the grey girders of a gas-fired power plant capable of generating electricity for up to 800,000 homes – and substantial profits for its owner. Debate is raging over the role of gas-fired electricity in the energy crisis. Coryton is one of a fleet of UK peaking plants, so-called because they tend to be fired up at peak consumption times, a backstop when other contributors to the grid, such as windfarms, underperform. But they also attract some of the highest rates per megawatt hour (MWh) of any power source, and those rates have jumped with the gas price since the invasion of Ukraine,leading to calls for their profits to be capped. Another source of controversy is that unlike oil and gas extraction, peaking plant income is not subject to the government’s windfall tax. The design of Britain’s energy market is under scrutiny as never before, as efforts to decarbonise collide with a need to keep the lights on during the Russian-inflicted gas shortage. Ofgem will soon publish proposals designed to prevent backup generators from raking in “excessive” profits as part of their licence conditions. Supporters argue they are an essential rapid source of electricity supplies, and cannot be relied upon to produce reliable profits; detractors say they are owned by sophisticated traders maximising returns when the market is tight. Last month National Grid paid a record £27m on a single day to get power stations to crank up supply at short notice, including £6,000 a MWh to fire up Rye House power station in Hertfordshire. Rye House belongs to VPI, a subsidiary of the Swiss trading multinational Vitol. Like many other peaking plants, it has passed into the hands of overseas investors as some of the biggest UK operators have exited the market. Coryton was owned by InterGen until last week. It now belongs to the Czech financier Pavel Hubáček’s Creditas investment group, which bought it from another Czech businessman and China Huaneng and Guangdong Energy. Yet another Czech billionaire, Daniel Křetínský, owns EP UK Investments, which has a power plant collection that includes South Humber Bank and Langage – formerly owned by Centrica. Known as the Czech Sphinx for his aversion to publicity, Křetínský has varied UK interests, including stakes in Sainsbury’s and Royal Mail. Prices paid for gas-powered electricity this winter are unprecedented. The average offer price for “balancing actions” – to align supply and demand – between the start of September and early January was £287 a MWh. Data from Elexon, which oversees the market, shows Rye House submitted the 20 highest winter bids – between £5,000 and £6,000 a MWh – for varying volumes of power on 12 December, setting new records. That day, VPI earned more than £11m, while InterGen received an estimated £12.6m from Coryton, according to figures from the market data platform EnAppSys. InterGen said a rise in demand had produced a “particularly pronounced spike” on 12 December, and that it always acted “in line with regulations and guidance issued to the market, to provide energy to balance the grid and keep the lights on across the UK”. Among the other plants bidding above-average winter prices were Uniper’s Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal-fired plant in Nottinghamshire and its gas power station Killingholme in north Lincolnshire, as well as Dinorwig, a pumped hydroelectric power plant in north Wales that is majority-owned by the French multinational Engie and is the fastest source of electricity in the UK. Cowes power station on the Isle of Wight and the Didcot plant in Oxfordshire both bid at £1,500 for small volumes in October. Controversially, none of these profits have been subject to the windfall tax introduced by Rishi Sunak when he was chancellor and expanded under Jeremy Hunt. Companies House records showed VPI Holding’s pre-tax profits surged from £44m in 2020 to £204m in 2021, on turnover that more than doubled to £2.1bn. Reuters reported in September that Vitol made more profit in the first half of 2022 than in the whole of 2021 – close to $4.5bn (£3.6bn), compared with a net record of just over $4.2bn in the 12 months before. The ‘electricity penalty shootout’ The country’s electricity supply industry is a complex jigsaw puzzle designed to encourage the generation of everything from wind, solar and nuclear power to biomass and gas-fired. Underpinning this is the “balancing market”, operated in effect by National Grid, which relies on offering the right prices to incentivise power plants to help balance supply and demand. Last winter, the network operator tripled its spend on balancing the grid to £1.5bn. The system is designed to prioritise renewable electricity ahead of nuclear, coal and gas. The electricity price in every half-hour period is set by the marginal cost of the last generating unit to be turned off to meet demand – usually gas-fired plants, which have the highest costs. While gas prices were low, there were few objections to this system, but the energy crisis has triggered repeated calls for gas and electricity pricing to be delinked. The supplier Good Energy draws the analogy with a penalty shootout in football: the best players (renewables) are selected first “but it’s the individual who steps up last who has the final say, deciding the fate of the result” – in this case, the cost. Gas-fired power still plays a significant role in Britain’s electricity makeup, accounting for 38% of generation last year – a three-year high as the single largest source of power and well ahead of a record 25.6% for wind. If peaking plants are used regularly, their role could be seen more as “baseload” than backup power. There are concerns about the tactics used by some generators. The energy regulator Ofgem said in November that last winter some generators had declared their plants unavailable to the grid, before later offering power at much higher prices. In 2020, Ofgem required InterGen to pay £37m after concluding that it “sent misleading signals to National Grid in 2016 about how much energy it would supply during peak winter hours to make a substantial profit”. The regulator found InterGen made £12.8m through “manipulation of the market”. At the time, the company said: “We deeply regret and sincerely apologise for the behaviour of former traders.” VPI said any suggestion it had made excessive profits was “not accurate” and that it operated “within the rules of the energy market”. It said peaking plants operated “less frequently, with costs to generate and pricing dependent on market conditions”. A spokesperson added: “VPI has invested to almost triple its generation capacity in the last two years and revenue has grown as a result.” Left out from the levy When Hunt extended the windfall tax last year from oil and gas producers to the excess profits from nuclear, solar and wind, he exempted gas peaking plants, warning of “unintended impacts” amid fears European gas supplies could fall short of demand, leading to blackouts. ScottishPower’s chief executive, Keith Anderson, condemned the decision. “The crisis has been made by gas and paid for by renewables,” he said, adding that it was “strange” for government to “cap the price of low-carbon generation and to leave gas generation untouched”. But Tom Glover, the UK country chair of RWE, which owns several gas-fired stations, said they could go for many years without making enough profit. “It’s important that when prices improve and allow them to make higher returns they are able to keep that profit so that they are incentivised to keep these power stations open during lower priced periods. These stations are like insurance policies for the whole market,” he said. A lengthy process designed to deink the price of electricity from gas has begun. Before that, authorities will have to decide whether to act or to stomach peaking plants making significant – if unpredictable – profits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/feb/21/hawks-in-iran-and-israel-agree-bidens-bid-to-salvage-nuclear-deal-must-not-succeed","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-02-21T07:00:54Z","webTitle":"Hawks in Iran and Israel agree: Biden’s bid to salvage nuclear deal must not succeed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/21/hawks-in-iran-and-israel-agree-bidens-bid-to-salvage-nuclear-deal-must-not-succeed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/21/hawks-in-iran-and-israel-agree-bidens-bid-to-salvage-nuclear-deal-must-not-succeed","fields":{"headline":"Hawks in Iran and Israel agree: Biden’s bid to salvage nuclear deal must not succeed","bodyText":"For sworn enemies, Iran and Israel have much in common. Both are regional powers, projecting their interests beyond their borders. Both are beholden, in different ways, to shifting US policy. Both have secretive nuclear programmes. And both are heading towards national elections – in Israel next month, in Iran in June – that could decide whether cold-hearted enmity turns into hot-blooded war. The stand-off over Iran’s alleged attempts, which are always denied, to acquire atomic bomb-making capacity has gone on for so long that its dangers are often underestimated. Yet the coming days are crucial. Iran has set 21 February as a deadline for an easing of unilateral US sanctions. If it is ignored, Tehran is threatening to ban snap UN inspections of its nuclear facilities and further ramp up proscribed atomic activities. That could sound the death knell for the 2015 nuclear deal that was negotiated by Barack Obama and European countries, which has slowly unravelled since Donald Trump reneged on it in 2018. Joe Biden says he wants to salvage the deal. Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s centrist president, has offered to negotiate. But each side, trapped by decades of hostility, is insisting that the other takes the first step. The escalating crisis has brought a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent days, involving Germany and Qatar who are acting as go-betweens. Crucially, the US accepted an EU invitation to join talks with Iran on returning to mutual compliance with the deal. In its response on Friday, Iran’s foreign ministry stuck to its previous position that all sanctions must be lifted before talks can begin This will not be the last word. But it is a reminder of the sobering – and alarming – reality that powerful individuals and factions on both sides are doing all they can to ensure the 2015 deal definitively collapses. In Iran, hardline candidates and members of the Majlis (parliament), focused on June’s presidential poll, oppose any kind of rapprochement with America. They include leading presidential hopeful Hossein Dehghan. He reportedly has the backing of Iran’s ultra-conservative supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has sworn never to talk to America. Dehghan accuses Biden of bad faith. “We still see the same policies … as we did from the Trump team: not lifting the oppressive sanctions against the Iranian people,” he told the Guardian Such scepticism reflects genuine distrust, and fear of another Trump-style stab in the back. But it is also the result of calculation, suggested analyst Saeid Jafari . “Biden’s victory [over Trump] came as a big disappointment to hardliners seeking to undermine Rouhani’s last-ditch effort to save the nuclear accord,” he wrote. They may try to scupper any talks. “They had hoped Trump’s re-election would help them oust reformist and moderate candidates in June … Now hardliners are taking every measure to pave the way for an extremist candidate to come to power … They are doing everything they can to prevent the revival of the nuclear deal.” Strong opposition to the deal, however Biden plays it, is evident in Israel, where the hard-right prime minister and close Trump ally, Benjamin Netanyahu, is fighting for his political life. Netanyahu encouraged Trump to ditch the pact, even as Israel has expanded its own nuclear facilities. He vehemently warns against resurrecting it as he woos Jewish supremacist parties in Israel’s fourth election in two years. Netanyahu’s stance is not controversial in Israel, where Iran is viewed as an existential threat. The argument is with Biden and Democrats in Washington. They have not forgiven the Israeli leader for undermining Obama’s peacemaking efforts. It was no accident Biden waited nearly a month after assuming the presidency before calling Netanyahu last week. The White House is said to privately hope Netanyahu loses. Jerusalem’s hawks have many supporters in Washington. The veteran neoconservative Elliott Abrams is one. He is urging an uncompromising “policy of deterrence” to subdue Iran, backed by armed force. Biden’s offer to talk has prompted accusations of “appeasement”. There has been fierce pushback in some quarters over Biden’s appointment of Robert Malley, an ardent advocate of diplomacy over force, as Iran envoy. Concern is also building that Biden’s deliberate distancing from the Saudi crown prince and suspected murderer, Mohammed bin Salman, a close collaborator with Trump and Netanyahu, will be another dangerous gift to Iran. Last week’s rocket attack on a coalition base in northern Iraq and Houthi drone strikes on Saudi Arabia from Yemen are cited by American and Israeli hardliners as proof that Iran and its allied militias will not halt their regional power-games – and that Biden is naive if he believes that fanatical fundamentalists would honour any settlement. Additional obstacles to progress include Washington’s wish to expand future negotiations to include Iran’s ballistic missiles, military presence in Syria, and support for Shia militias in Lebanon and elsewhere. Complicating matters, China and Russia will unhelpfully demand a say. Against all this must be set common sense. Trump’s maximum pressure policy failed miserably. It did not mitigate regional tensions or reduce proxy attacks. Rather, illegal US and Israeli assassinations of high-profile figures increased them. Sanctions have hurt Iranians, but did not topple the regime or change its behaviour. Iran is closer now to a nuclear weapon than in 2016. Biden’s instinct to try to break this impasse and find a diplomatic way through – supported by the UK, Germany and France – is the right one. But words are not enough. As a sign of good faith, he should swiftly relax some sanctions and unfreeze Iran’s Covid-related $5bn IMF loan request. Time is short. Proving peace works may be the only way to halt the fatal advance of warmongers in Israel and Iran."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/28/millions-of-households-pay-170-more-for-energy-due-to-tory-subsidy-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-28T05:00:45Z","webTitle":"Millions of households pay £170 more for energy due to Tory subsidy cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/28/millions-of-households-pay-170-more-for-energy-due-to-tory-subsidy-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/28/millions-of-households-pay-170-more-for-energy-due-to-tory-subsidy-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Millions of households pay £170 more for energy due to Tory subsidy cuts","bodyText":"Millions of households are paying an extra £170 in bills because of cuts to subsidies for measures such as home insulation, according to analysis that comes during an impasse on the government’s energy strategy. One cabinet source said it was now likely the strategy – designed to tackle rising bills and boost energy security – would not be ready this week, amid cabinet splits over funding for nuclear power and the relaxing of planning rules concerning onshore wind. On Sunday one cabinet minister suggested the government was looking seriously at schemes to offer homeowners discounts on energy if they live near new windfarms or nuclear plants. “We’ve seen great examples of other people where if they build a nuclear power station, within a certain radius of that power station they get free power,” said the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi. Campaigners have said the strategy should include further measures to make homes more energy efficient, on top of the announcement last week that VAT would be cut on materials used for measures such as the installation of solar panels and heat pumps. Analysis highlighted by Labour found a fall in home insulation rates since 2012, when many subsidies were cut, meaning that at least 9 million households were now paying £170 a year more in electricity bills. The party has called for a national homes insulation programme, which the shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, said would reduce energy consumption enough to nullify the amount of gas imported from Russia. Installations averaged 40,000 a month in 2012 under the previous government’s insulation programmes, the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) and the community energy saving programme (CESP). But these ended at the end of 2012 and were replaced by other schemes, including a loan system that had low take-up. The analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit suggests insulation rates subsequently fell by 92%. An additional 9 million households would be likely to have benefited from the energy-saving measures had they continued at pre-2012 levels. Labour has pledged £60bn of public investment to bring all homes up to the energy performance certificate (EPC) band C rating over 10 years, claiming it would save each family £400 a year on their energy bills and cut national gas imports by up to 15%. The average E-rated home is set to require an additional £320 a year for energy bills compared with a C-rated property. “The chancellor’s disastrous spring statement is unraveling because he failed to tackle the cost of living crisis that working people face,” Miliband said. “The government’s energy relaunch will have no credibility unless it finally delivers on energy efficiency – the best, most effective way to reduce energy bills, cut our demand for fossil fuels and bring down carbon emissions.” Sunak is expected to come under fire at the Treasury select committee hearing on Monday after a furious response to the spring statement, widely seen as not doing enough to ease the cost of living crisis. Johnson is expected to try to reconcile senior cabinet ministers this week amid fallout from the spring statement, and to resolve tensions over the energy strategy. A government source confirmed reports in the Sunday Times that Downing Street was looking at preliminary proposals for a new council tax rebate in the autumn, with consumers facing the possibility of further fuel bill rises in October. On Friday the energy price cap will rise by almost £700 to £1,971 – and it could rise to about £2,500 by October 2022 for the average dual fuel bill. Meanwhile, Zahawi hinted that the government could do more to help with the cost of living crisis. “I think he [Rishi Sunak, the chancellor] will continue to keep an eye on this, it’s only right,” he said. “It’s irresponsible for me to say ‘job done’ because energy prices are volatile, inflation remains high, so it would be absolutely irresponsible to say ‘job done’. But I think £22bn, in one year, of help when you’ve just spent £400bn is the right thing to do.” The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Sunak had been “playing games” by announcing a future 1p cut to income tax in the statement while people were struggling this year. “Rishi Sunak absolutely had more room for manoeuvre in this spring statement and mini budget, but rather than acting in the interests of the British people, he was playing games,” Ashworth said. “He was acting in his own interest because he thinks by offering an income tax cut in two years, that’ll help him politically with Conservative MPs if there’s a leadership contest or that’ll fit the Tory election grid.” As well as a major expansion in energy efficiency measures, Labour has called for the chancellor to cut VAT on energy bills and to impose a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies, as well as cancelling the planned rise in national insurance from April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/aug/12/boris-johnson-says-uk-energy-bill-support-package-is-not-enough","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T14:31:03Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson says UK energy-bill support package is not enough","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/12/boris-johnson-says-uk-energy-bill-support-package-is-not-enough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/aug/12/boris-johnson-says-uk-energy-bill-support-package-is-not-enough","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson says UK energy-bill support package is not enough","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has acknowledged that the package of support to help people pay surging energy bills is not enough, as the split deepens between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss over how to deal with the crisis. Amid forecasts that energy bills could hit £5,000 a year by next April, the prime minister made clear that he expected his successor to act. Asked if the current package of £400 off energy bills, plus a £650 cost-of-living payment for vulnerable households, was enough, Johnson said: “No, because what I’m saying what we’re doing in addition is trying to make sure that by October, by January, there is further support, and what the government will be doing, whoever is the prime minister, is making sure there is extra cash to help people.” Johnson said earlier this week that he was sure his successor would offer more help with the cost of living, but Truss has held off spelling out how she would act and repeatedly dismissed the idea of “Gordon Brown style” “handouts”. Her stance appears to have slightly softened, with her campaign suggesting help would be forthcoming. However, Thérèse Coffey, the work and pensions secretary and one of Truss’s key allies, said on Friday that the cost of bills would be “nowhere near” the levels predicted by independent analysts. Defending Truss, Coffey said: “She is absolutely an MP who knows what it is like for struggling households and that is why, quite rightly in a considered way, once Ofgem comes up with their price cap … all of government … and it will be a decision for the new prime minister to enact what changes could be made.” Sunak announced a £10bn package on Friday designed to help with energy bills this autumn, saying he could be open to “some limited and temporary one-off borrowing as a last resort to get us through this winter”. “People need reassurance now about what we will do and I make no apology for concentrating on what matters most,” Sunak wrote in the Times, which reported that he valued a cut to VAT on energy at £5bn. He was also said to have promised to find the same amount again to go towards helping those most in need, as he said: “You can’t heat your home with hope.” The former chancellor also highlighted Truss’s refusal to say whether she would maintain the windfall tax on oil and gas profits, which is expected to bring in more than £5bn from oil and gas giants making money out of high prices. In an interview with Times Radio, Sunak defended the windfall tax he had implemented as chancellor, saying it would “automatically raise more money” in tax to support struggling households as energy profits increase. The former chancellor added: “I think that is the right thing to do and I think Liz Truss last night said she opposed doing that, and actually didn’t believe in that policy, so I think that is a question for her to answer.” He also said his opponent’s plans to cut taxes would do “virtually nothing” for pensioners or the least well off. A Sunak campaign spokesperson added that Truss had “blown a further £5bn black hole in her plans” by not backing the windfall tax. Sunak also rejected the idea that Truss was the frontrunner and likely to win, saying that “lots of people have not made up their mind”. After Thursday’s hustings, Truss reiterated her belief that tax cuts should be the main response to soaring bills. Truss told an audience of Tory members in Cheltenham that this would always be her “first port of call”, followed by a focus on longer-term energy supply issues such as support for fracking and nuclear power. Truss said she could provide other assistance, but gave no details, saying she “can’t write the chancellor’s budget” before even being elected as prime minister. “If the answer to every question is raising tax, we will choke off economic growth, and we will send ourselves to penury, and I think that’s a massive problem,” she said. • This article was amended on 15 August 2022 to clarify that the government’s £400 and £650 payments are separate grants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/mar/03/ukraine-news-russia-war-vladimir-putin-biden-latest-live-updates-kherson-kyiv-kharkiv-refugees-russian-invasion","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T05:31:03Z","webTitle":"More than 500 international students trapped in Ukrainian town – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/03/ukraine-news-russia-war-vladimir-putin-biden-latest-live-updates-kherson-kyiv-kharkiv-refugees-russian-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/mar/03/ukraine-news-russia-war-vladimir-putin-biden-latest-live-updates-kherson-kyiv-kharkiv-refugees-russian-invasion","fields":{"headline":"More than 500 international students trapped in Ukrainian town – as it happened","bodyText":"This liveblog is closing now but our coverage continues on this liveblog. Thank you for reading. It is 7.27am in Ukraine as Russia’s war on its neighbour enters its ninth day. Here is where the crisis stands: A fire broke out in a training building outside a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday, after being shelled by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. An employee at the plant said Russian forces had fired on the facility and there was “a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe”. After burning for at least four hours amid reports Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze, Ukrainian emergency services confirmed the blaze was extinguished at 6.20am local time. Fighting at the plant has also reportedly stopped, according to the mayor of Enerhodar, a town located south-east of the plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier said it had put its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at Zaporizhzhia. However, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm provided reassurance surrounding the Zaporizhzhia power plant reactors, saying there was no elevated radiation readings near the facility and the plant’s reactors are “protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy made another appeal to Europe for help following the attack on the nuclear plant. He said: We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism. British prime minister Boris Johnson called Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe. Russian forces continue to control both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv. In a televised speech shortly after his 90-minute call with Macron, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence. Ukrainian emergency services have confirmed a fire in the training building of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant has been extinguished after a blaze burned for at least four hours throughout early Friday morning. No casualties have so far been reported. An update published to the State Emergency Services official Telegram account reads: At 06:20 the fire in the training building of Zaporizhzhya NPP in Energodar was extinguished. There are no victims.” Home rental company Airbnb Inc is suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus, according to chief executive officer Brian Chesky. The mayor of Enerhodar, a town located about 150km south-east of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, has said fighting at the plant has stopped, according to BBC Ukrainian, citing a local broadcaster. The news comes after the plant reportedly sustained several hours of heavy shelling and a fire which broke out on the third, fourth and fifth floor of a building at the complex, according to Ukrainian emergency officials. Ukrainian emergency services have confirmed a fire in the training building of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant has been localised just before 6am local time. An update published to the State Emergency Services official Telegram account reads: At 05:55 a fire in the training building (size 60x40 m) of Zaporizhzhya NPP in Enerhodar was localised on an area of 2 thousand square meters.” Guardian reporters Calla Wahlquist and Donna Lu have compiled an explainer on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant with all the details you need to know. You can read their full report below. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says it has puts its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. IAEA director general, Rafael Gross, added he was “deeply concerned” with the situation and had spoken with Ukraine’s prime minister Denys Shmygal to monitor and stay in close contact with Ukraine’s nuclear regulator and operator. https://twitter.com/rafaelmgrossi/status/1499595087432626176?s=20&amp;t=UvSEC6j6NoH1WTvVJ9ZfTg Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau has also confirmed he has spoken with Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy about the “horrific attacks “at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. “These unacceptable attacks by Russia must cease immediately,” Trudeau said. Ukrainian emergency services have confirmed rescue teams are currently on the site of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant to extinguish the fire which started earlier in the morning in the training building. Earlier, the agency said Russian troops has prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze. However, in an update published to its official Telegram account just after 5.30am local time, the service said as of 5.20am, SES units had been deployed to put out the fire in the training building. Meanwhile, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has provided more reassurance surrounding the reactors at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, confirming she had spoken with Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko. In an update posted to Twitter, Granholm said: We have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility. The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.” Ukrainian emergency services are saying Russian troops are preventing them from extinguishing a fire that continues to burn at a nuclear power plant after it was struck by shelling. In an update published to its official Telegram account at 4am local time, the State Emergency Services said: The occupiers do not allow the SES units [Ukrainian public rescue teams] to start eliminating the consequences of the fire.” The agency said that one of the buildings of the plant’s training complex “continues to burn”, adding that “the fire covered 3, 4, 5 floors of a five-storey building.” Corroborating an early analysis from the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Julian Borger, reporter Donna Lu brings us another perspective from Tony Irwin, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University. According to Iwin, the chances of explosion, nuclear meltdown or radioactive release from the Zaporizhzhya power plant are low. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the largest in Europe, contains six 950 megawatt pressurised water nuclear (PWR) reactors. Irwin said the PWR reactors are “a lot safer” than the reactors at Chernobyl, and did not appear to be damaged yet. The reactors have large concrete contaminants and built-in fire protection systems, he said, adding: “Obviously, it’s not a good idea if you start shooting massive missiles at reactors. The PWR type is a much safer sort of reactor, because it’s a two-circuit design reactor. The water that keeps the reactor cool is on a separate circuit to the second one, which actually supplies the power to the turbine and the outside. The chance of a [radioactive] release from this sort of reactor is a lot lower. These reactors have back-up emergency cooling systems as well. In addition to the normal reactor cooling, they got a passive system, they’ve got high pressure injection systems, they’ve got low-pressure injection systems. The passive cooling systems work in the absence of electricity supply or diesel generators, Irwin said. “Ultimately if they disabled all the outside supplies [of electricity] and all the diesel generators, eventually there won’t be enough cooling and you’ll melt the core. But I think we’re a long way off from that at the moment. Irwin, who operated nuclear power plants in the UK for three decades, is a former manager of the open-pool Australian lightwater (OPAL) reactor, Australia’s only nuclear reactor. A shutdown of the Zaporizhzhya plant would lead to a “severe loss of power in Ukraine”, he said. A fire is reportedly still burning in Europe’s largest nuclear power plant located in Zaporizhzhia, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Services. Andriy Tuz, a spokesperson for the plant appeared on Telegram earlier in the morning around 3am local time, saying: “There is a real threat of a nuclear danger at the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe. We demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire at the energy blocks of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.” Video footage of the fire - which broke out early in the morning on Friday - can be viewed below. Here is an analysis on the significance of the nuclear power plant attack from the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Juian Borger. The confinement chambers of a nuclear reactor are built to withstand heavy impact and even bombing, while the VVER pressurised water reactor itself is designed to shut down in an emergency. VVER reactors are considered much safer than the type of reactor that blew up in Chernobyl in 1986, for example. But nuclear safety experts warned that any interruption to the power supply that affects the cooling system could start a chain of events that could lead to disaster, as could a direct hit on the spent fuel pools which are not as well protected as the reactors. “If the building is not damaged and if the reactors entered safe shut down, and have secondary or tertiary cooling systems then there should be little risk. If those conditions are not met, there is a significant risk,” Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the national security council, said on Twitter. The Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine – which houses six of the country’s 15 nuclear reactors – as well as the neighbouring town of Energodar, have been surrounded by Russian troops since the beginning of the week. Read the full story below. British prime minister Boris Johnson has spoken with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy after news broke about a fire at the nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhia, calling Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe. A Downing Street spokeswoman called the situation “gravely concerning”. PA Media reports the spokeswoman said: Both leaders agreed that Russia must immediately cease its attack on the power station and allow unfettered access for emergency services to the plant. The Prime Minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe. He said the UK would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further. The Prime Minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN Security Council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners. Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has made another appeal to Europe for help following the attack on Ukraine’s nuclear plant. Europe must wake up now. The largest nuclear station in Europe is on fire. Right now Russian tanks are shelling nuclear units. Those are the tanks that have thermal vision, so they know where they are shelling. They prepared for it. I address all Ukrainians and all Europeans to all people who know the word Chernobyl who know how much suffering and victims were caused by the explosion at the nuclear station. It was a global disaster. Hundreds of thousands of people fought against its consequences. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated. Russia wants to repeat it but six times harder. Europeans, please, wake up. Tell your politicians, Russian troops are shelling [the] Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the city of Enerhodar. There are 6 energy unit. Six. One unit exploded in Chernobyl. We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism. Russian propagandists threatened to cover the world with nuclear ashes. Now it’s not a threat. It’s a reality. We don’t know how the fire at the station will end, when an explosion will happen, god willing, it won’t happen. Our guys always kept the station safe, so there were no provocations, so that nobody could seize the station, so that nobody could plant mines at the station then blackmail the whole world with a nuclear disaster. We must stop Russian troops. Tell your politicians: Ukraine is 15 nuclear units. If there will be an explosion, it will the end to all of us, the end of Europe, the evacuation of Europe. Only immediate action of Europe can stop Russian troops and prevent the death of Europe from the disaster at a nuclear station.” Our diplomatic editor has more on the call between Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the wake of the nuclear plant fire: Authorities at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant say the facility is secured and “nuclear safety is now guaranteed” after Russian military shelling starts fire, Agence France-Presse reports. US President Joe Biden has just spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the White House continues to monitor the fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. According to readout of the call published by the White House Press Office, Biden joined Zelenskiy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allowing firefighters and emergency responders to access the site. Biden also spoke with under secretary for nuclear security of the US Department of Energy and Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to receive an update on the situation at the plant. Andrey Tuz, spokesman for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, has said shelling has stopped for the time being, but the situation is extremely uncertain. Speaking to the BBC Russian Service, he said: They bombed everything they could, including blocks and everything else. Now the information is being clarified, it’s hard to say everything. [To the station] a white car, representatives of the Russian military, has left. It’s flashing with its headlights. Now it’s being determined whether they will be approached for negotiations, or how to proceed further.” A series of photos from the air and on the ground provide some more context as to the location and significance of the recent Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant fire. The Ukrainian State Emergency Service is reporting that radiation and fire safety conditions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are “within normal limits”. An update on the agency’s official Telegram account reads: As of 02:26 in the city of Energodar at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the third power unit was disconnected from the unified energy system (only Unit 4 is operating). Of the six power units, one is currently operating. Radiation and fire safety conditions at nuclear power plants are within normal limits. Fire condition at the NPP is normal.” The agency said a fire broke out in the training building outside the NPP, however the Guardian has been unable to verify these claims. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the Ukraine regulator told the agency there has been “no change” reported in radiation levels at the plant. Here’s exactly where the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine took place early on Friday morning. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says they are aware of reports of shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and are in contact with Ukrainian authorities. According to a statement, the IAEE said Ukraine had informed the agency that a large number of Russian tanks and infantry “broke through the block-post” to the town of Enerhodar, a few kilometres from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). Director general Rafael Mariano Grossi appealed for an immediate halt to the use of force at Enerhodar and called on the military forces operating there to refrain from violence near the nuclear power plant. He added the IAEA continues to consult with Ukraine and others with a view to provide “maximum possible assistance to the country” as it seeks to maintain nuclear safety and security. The Guardian’s Julian Borger has spoken to Mariana Budjeryn, an Ukrainian expert at the project on managing the atom at Harvard University’s Belfer Center. Budjeryn said: Saying that a reactor building is hit doesn’t tell us much, because the most vulnerable [part of] this is the electricity and water supply. If the electricity is taken out, the back up generators kick in, but if those don’t kick in or their diesel fuel is set on fire, for example, the pumps can’t pump cold water into the reactor and into the spent fuel pools. That’s necessary to keep the nuclear reaction moderated. Otherwise the water will boil out and the core will go critical and explode. If the core explodes, there’s hope that the confinement chamber will capture the radiation from release into the environment. Confinement chambers are designed with withstand some level of impact even bombing. But of course we don’t know how they will stand to this intensity of shelling BUT spent fuel pools - the fuel there is not as active, but they are usually overstuffed - so less active but more tightly packed material, also dangerous for going critical if the cooling system fails. And spent fuel pools are not covered by hardened concrete confinement chambers. We learned about how vulnerable spent fuel pools are during Fukushima The backup generators failed and the water pumping system failed - it was lucky that ocean water flooded those and the reactor cores to provide cooling.” Alphabet Inc’s Google has said is has stopped selling online advertising in Russia, a ban that covers search, YouTube and outside publishing partners, Reuters reports. The move by the world’s top seller of online ads by revenue follows similar pauses in Russia by smaller internet companies Twitter Inc and Snap Inc. Ukraine’s foreign minister is now confirming reports of a fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, warning an explosion could have devastating consequences. In a tweet issued just after 2.30am local time, Dmytro Kuleba said: Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out. Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!” A fire has broken out in Europe’s largest nuclear power plant located in Zaporizhzhia, according to an announcement from plant employees and the mayor of the nearby town of Enerhodar. “As a result of continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire,” Enerhodar Mayor Dmytro Orlov said on his Telegram channel just after 1.30am local time, citing what he called a threat to world security. Orlov recorded a short video message which has now been shared my multiple local Ukrainian media outlets, urging Russian troops to immediately stop shelling the plant. The official earlier said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city’s outskirts and reported that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant. Loud shots and rocket fire were heard late Thursday. According to a Telegram message posted by an employee at the plant, Russian troops fired at the nuclear facility. Attention! Equipment of the Russian Federation is firing at the Zaporozhye NPP. There is a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. We demand a ceasefire from heavy equipment at the Zaporozhye NPP! As of 2.30am local time, the employee added that firefighters have been unable to reach the scene of the fire, claiming the outbreak was a result of shots by Russian troops. Ukrainian news agencies UNIAN and Hromadske also report that a fire has started at the nuclear power plant. It remains unclear exactly where the fire is located within the plant or the damage inflicted so far. The city on the Dnieper River accounts for one-quarter of the country’s power generation. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you as my colleague Maanvi Singh signs off. For any tips and feedback please contact me through Twitter or at samantha.lock@theguardian.com The UK’s defence secretary Ben Wallace has told the BBC that Russia’s military strategy is not going to plan. Wallace said logistics recovered from armoured vehicles show the Russian army is behind schedule - and that plans to appeal to Ukrainians as “liberators” have failed. President Putin on the other hand has insisted Russia’s invasion is “going to plan” in a televised address on Thursday. It is 1:30am in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: Russian forces are in control of both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv. Another key objective for Russian forces in the south-east was Zaporizhzhia and its nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest. Russian troops were trying to break through a barricade to the plant erected by residents and territorial defence forces. At least 33 civilians had been killed in a Russian airstrike on a residential area in the northern city of Chernihivon Thursday, Ukrainian authorities say. The death toll across Ukraine is continuing to rise. Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, the Élysée Palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.” In a televised speech shortly after his 90-minute call with Macron, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence. Ukraine and Russia agreed to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks this afternoon, but the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the outcome of today’s talks had fallen short of Ukraine’s hopes. A third round of talks is set to take place at the start of next week, the Belarus state news agency Belta cited Podolyak as saying. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for direct talks with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, saying it was “the only way to stop this war”. Speaking at a press conference, Zelenskiy called on the west to increase military aid to Ukraine, warning that the rest of Europe would be under threat if Russia was allowed to advance. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has imposed sanctions on the Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, whose commercial links to Everton football club have been suspended, and the Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, the Foreign Office has said. The Pentagon has established communication with the Russian ministry of defense, “for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation”, a defense official told the AP. That such a “deconfliction” line has been established has not been officially announced yet, but multiple news organizations have confirmed the news. The line was reportedly established on 1 March. – Leonie Chao-Fong, Maanvi Singh According to GlobalCheck, a service that tracks Internet censorship in the CIS countries, the BBC is now blocked in Russia, as is Deutsche Welle: This comes after the EU blocked content from Russian state-backed RT and Sputnik. The UK, fearing an outright ban could lead to reciprocal action by Moscow against the BBC, instead asked Ofcom to monitor and investigate RT’s output. But the EU sanction de facto got RT off UK airwaves, because Sky received its RT broadcasts from Luxembourg. The Biden administration will allow Ukrainians in the US Temporary Protected Status, a designation that will them to continue living and working in the country for 18 months. Department of Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced the news today: Some 75,000 Ukrainians in the US will be eligible to apply. The move comes after immigrant advocates pushed for the US to quickly accommodate Ukranians already in the US as Russian began bombarding their home country. But the US has yet to extend similar protections for tens of thousands of Afghans in US prior to and following the chaotic evacuation last summer. Emmanuel Akinwotu, Julian Borger and Lisa O’Carroll report: More than 500 international students are trapped in Sumy, a town 40km from Ukraine’s northeast border that has been battered by days of shelling by Russian forces. Most of the students are Nigerian, while others are from Ghana, Ethiopia, Angola, Tanzania, Rwanda, Ireland, India, Lebanon and Turkey. They have all suddenly found themselves stranded in a war zone. Trains and buses have stopped running; roads and bridges out of the city have been destroyed and fighting has been reported in the city’s streets. The students have remained in five hostel buildings since the Russian invasion began last week, after advice from their university to stay behind – even as many Ukrainian students fled. Oluwaseun Adefemi, a Nigerian medical student who arrived in Sumy in January, said that food and water supplies were already running low and it was no longer safe to head to local stores. “We are hearing blasts every day. We have to run into our bunkers each time. Yesterday we heard the blasts at six or seven in the morning. When we hear them, we run to the basement – that’s our makeshift bunker,” he said, speaking by telephone late on Wednesday. “We are running out of food, we’re running out of water. What we have now is mainly soda water,” Adefemi said. While the conflict has so far mainly focused on the outskirts of the city, fears are rising that troops may soon enter the city. Read more: The fall of the first Ukrainian city to the Russian army bodes ill for the rest of the country. Russian forces, reports suggest, surrounded and starved the southern Dnieper River port of Kherson into submission. Kherson’s mayor told reporters that many citizens had been left dead and unrecognisable by high-calibre weapons used by the Russians to bombard his city. Vladimir Putin’s siege tactics, familiar to anyone who remembers Russia’s role in the 2017 battle for Aleppo in Syria, today amount to war crimes. Russian soldiers are threatening to destroy Ukrainian cities unless they surrender. The mayor of Mariupol, on the Black Sea, said that Mr Putin’s army was attacking rail lines and road bridges, as well as cutting off water and electricity, to prevent civilians from escaping the shelling. In 2014, Mr Putin described Kyiv as “the mother of Russian cities”. That his military is preparing to encircle the Ukrainian capital with enough firepower to leave it a charred ruin shows his potential descent into criminal folly. One can only hope that one day the Russian president will be sitting in a dock at The Hague where his ramblings can be exposed for what they are: no defence for the senseless killing of innocents. The criminality of Mr Putin’s invasion is staggering. He is sowing death and panic in Ukraine, with apparent little regard for civilian lives. His war is only a week old and Russian forces are already raining down cluster munitions on residential areas. Airstrikes, Ukrainian officials claim, hit schools and homes in the Chernihiv region. The French president’s assessment after talking to Mr Putin that the “worst is still to come” in Ukraine is unlikely to be a scare tactic. Some of Mr Putin’s own troops appear to have no stomach for an offensive war in Ukraine on the basis that they are, as Moscow claims, protecting Russia’s strategic interests. Instead the Ukrainian military casts opposing soldiers as hapless teenage invaders and wretched conscripts. Forcing poor young men to fight in an illegal war ought to be added to the list of charges Mr Putin might face. Read more: Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, has released a message to Ukrainians, saying that the Netherlands stands with them. Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister has accused Russia of staging humanitarian aid as troops advance of Kherson, a strategically important Black Sea port. And Lyubov Sobol, a member of the Russian Opposition Coordination Council, is echoing him. In justifying its war, Russia is investing a lot of time and effort in propaganda aimed at both Russians and Ukrainians. My Guardian colleagues reported earlier: US officials claim they have evidence of a Russian plan to make a “very graphic” fake video of a Ukrainian attack as a pretext for an invasion. The alleged plot would involve using corpses, footage of blown-up buildings, fake Ukrainian military hardware, Turkish-made drones and actors playing the part of Russian-speaking mourners. “We don’t know definitively that this is the route they are going to take, but we know that this is an option under consideration,” the deputy national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, told MSNBC, adding that the video “would involve actors playing mourners for people who are killed in an event that they would have created themselves”. Finer added: “That would involve the deployment of corpses to represent bodies purportedly killed, of people purportedly killed in an incident like this.” The Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, said the video would have purported to show a Ukrainian attack on Russian territory or Russian-speaking people in eastern Ukraine and would be “very graphic”. He added that the US believed that the plan had the backing of the Kremlin. “Our experience is that very little of this nature is not approved at the highest levels of the Russian government,” Kirby said. Sobol tweeted that a fake pro-Putin rally is being organized by Russian troops in Kherson. The Pentagon has established communication with the Russian ministry of defense, “for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation”, a defense official told the AP. That such a “deconfliction” line has been established has not been officially announced yet, but multiple news organizations have confirmed the news. The line was reportedly established on 1 March. The line would allow US and Russian forces to avoid crossing paths along the Polish border and the Black Sea, for example, while Russia advances on ukraine. The US and Russia had set up a similar line of communication in the Syrian conflict after Russia began military action there. A week after invasion of Ukraine launched, ICC confirms it is gathering evidence of possible war crimes. Here’s what we know so far, from the Guardian’s Jon Henley and Samantha Lock: Earlier today, Poland warned its citizens to leave Russia and Belarus due to ongoing fighting in Ukraine, reported Reuters: The Polish foreign ministry said on Thursday Polish citizens should leave Russia and Belarus due to the situation in Ukraine. “We recommend Polish citizens staying on the territory of the Russian Federation should leave its territory using available commercial and private transport,” it said, adding travel options were limited due to flights between the two countries being suspended. It issued a similar recommendation regarding Belarus, adding: “In the event of a drastic deterioration of the security situation, a closure of borders or other unforeseen situations, evacuation may turn out to be considerably difficult or even impossible.” Ukrainian atomic energy authorities have posted video online showing tracer fire at Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, Zaporizhzhya. Here’s the video that was posted to Youtube: The Guardian’s Julian Borger wrote today about concerns from UN officials as Russian forces claimed that they had surrounded the nuclear plant: The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, the second biggest in Europe, housing six of the country’s 15 reactors. In their letter to the IAEA, Russian officials insisted that Ukrainian staff at the plant were continuing to “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation”. However, the Ukrainian state enterprise running the country’s nuclear industry, Energoatom, accused the Russian military of “openly terrorizing employees of the station and residents of its satellite city Energodar”.

Earlier today, US prosecutors charged a Russian television producer and described oligarch, Konstantin Malofeyev, with violating sanctions related to Crimea, reported Reuters: U.S. prosecutors on Thursday charged a television producer for Konstantin Malofeyev, described as a Russian oligarch, with violating Crimea-related sanctions, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York said on Thursday. John Hanick, a U.S. citizen, was arrested in February in London and the United States is seeking his extradition. Prosecutors said Hanick was charged with violating U.S. sanctions arising from Russia’s 2014 invasion of the Crimean peninsula. Malofeyev is closely tied to Russian aggression in Ukraine, Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement. Amnesty International has criticised the EU decision to limit its Temporary Protection Directive (TPD), which will grant immediate protection in EU countries to people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine, to Ukrainian nationals. On Thursday, EU member states watered down a proposal from the European commission that would have seen all long term residents given the protection. Eve Geddie, Director of Amnesty International’s EU office said: “Everybody fleeing conflict must be provided with protection and help to establish themselves and we welcome that Ukrainians will be swiftly protected. But by restricting that assistance principally to Ukrainians fleeing conflict, the Council has also exposed the limitations of Europe’s solidarity. “Today’s decision means that Ukrainians seeking safety in the EU will quickly get residence permits, be able to work, and be provided with suitable accommodation, welfare assistance, medical assistance, and education. It is now up to member states to decide if they will extend that to others fleeing Ukraine. We call on them to treat everyone fleeing this conflict equally. “The Council’s decision today is a reminder that Europe has long had the tools to protect people fleeing war and help new arrivals, and the usual ‘Fortress Europe’ approach is a politically motivated choice. That this is happening for the first time but principally for displaced Ukrainian nationals shows that the EU’s approach is riddled with double standards.” This just in: RT America, apart of the global RT network that is funded by the Russian government, is stopping production and laying off most of its staff, reports CNN’s Oliver Darcy: The production company behind the American version of the Russian state-funded network RT laid off most of its staff on Thursday, according to a memo obtained by CNN. Misha Solodovnikov, the general manager of the production company, T&amp;R Productions, told staff that it will be “ceasing production” at all of its locations “as a result of unforeseen business interruption events.””Unfortunately, we anticipate this layoff will be permanent, meaning that this will result in the permanent separation from employment of most T&amp;R employees at all locations,” Solodovnikov wrote in his memo to employees. The layoffs would mean an effective end to RT America. The network, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s main mouthpieces in the US, was dropped earlier this week by DirecTV. The satellite carrier was one of the two major television providers in the US to carry the network. This story is still developing. Read the article here. The UK culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has written to TikTok, Twitter and Meta (the owner of Facebook and Instagram) asking them to block the online output of Kremlin-backed news services Russia Today and Sputnik. Writing to the platforms’ UK heads, she said: “I want to urge you to do everything you can to apply the approach you are taking across the EU to block access both to RT and to Sputnik’s online output (including the latter’s radio and audio services) on your UK services.” RT and Sputnik have already been blocked the platforms across the EU, while RT has already lost its Sky slot. The Guardian has approached TikTok, Meta and Twitter for comment. In a Twitter post, French president Emmanuel Macron said that during a conversation with Russian president Vladimir Putin this morning, Putin again refused to stop attacks against Ukraine. “I spoke to President Putin this morning. He refuses to stop his attacks on Ukraine at this point,” tweeted Macron. “It is vital to maintain dialogue to avoid human tragedy.” Macron said that he will continue communicating with Putin, adding that, “We must avoid the worst.” In a separate post, Macron continued: “Maintaining dialogue to protect the people, obtaining measures that will avoid human tragedy, putting an end to this war: this is the purpose of my commitment alongside President Zelensky and the international community,” ending his tweet by saying, “I am and will remain fully determined.” This just in: Ukraine and Russia have agreed to temporary, local ceasefires to allow the evacuation of civilians as well as aid deliveries via safe corridors. But some experts have warned that the creation of said “humanitarian corridors” and the backed ceasefires could be an opportunity for Russia to strategically resupply and regroup. More analysis on how Russia may use the ceasefire periods from Emma Beals, a senior adviser at the European Institute of Peace: Following up on newly announced sanctions against billionaire Alisher Usmanov and Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov by the UK, here’s a statement posted to Twitter from the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office on the additional penalties: The UK has imposed more sanctions on leading oligarchs. These associates of Putin are now cut off from their significant interests in UK. It is 9.18pm in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: Russian forces are in control of both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol.

More on the US’s announcement of additional sanctions targeting more Russian oligarchs... Here is an excerpt from the national security council fact sheet announcing the sanctions, with more context behind the additional penalties: Today, the United States, in coordination with Allies and partners, is targeting additional Russian elites and family members who continue supporting President Putin despite his brutal invasion of Ukraine... These individuals and their family members will be cut off from the U.S. financial system, their assets in the United States will be frozen and their property will be blocked from use. The Department of Treasury will share financial intelligence and other evidence where appropriate with the Department of Justice to support criminal prosecutions and seizure of assets. Today, the United States will sanction an expansive list of Putin’s cronies and their family members. One of the elites is Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, one of Russia’s wealthiest individuals and a close ally of Putin. His property will be blocked from use in the United States and by U.S. persons – including his superyacht, one of the world’s largest, and just seized by our ally Germany, and his private jet, one of Russia’s largest privately-owned aircraft. The United States will also sanction Dmitry Peskov, who as Putin’s spokesman is a top purveyor of Putin’s propaganda. The United States will also impose visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and close associates. As President Biden said, [we] will continue to work with our Allies and partners to hold accountable the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who are profiting from this violent regime. The United States and governments all over the world will work to identify and freeze the assets Russian elites and their family members hold in our respective jurisdictions – their yachts, luxury apartments, money, and other ill-gotten gains. The US will be issuing additional sanctions targeting more Russian oligarchs, including the billionaire Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, the White House said today. Here is a list of who will be targeted in this newly announced round, according to a fact sheet provided by a spokesperson with the national security council: Nikolai Tokarev (his wife, Galina, daughter Mayya, and his two luxury real estate companies) Boris Rotenberg (his wife, Karina, and his sons Roman and Boris) Arkady Rotenberg (his sons Pavel and Igor and daughter Liliya) Sergei Chemezov (his wife, Yekaterina, his son Stanislav, and stepdaughter Anastasiya) Igor Shuvalov (his five companies, his wife, Olga, his son Evgeny and his company and jet, and his daughter Maria and her company) Yevgeniy Prigozhin (his three companies, his wife, Polina, his daughter Lyubov, and his son Pavel) Dmitry Peskov, President Putin’s press secretary Alisher Usmanov (his superyacht, one of the world’s largest and just seized by Germany, and his private jet, one of Russia’s largest privately owned aircraft) The US will also be placing visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 “family members and close associates”. The UK foreign secretary Liz Truss has sanctioned the Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, the Foreign Office has said. Drone footage shows devastated town near Kyiv Drone footage shows debris and destroyed buildings as well as burnt-out Russian military vehicles in Borodyanka, a small town 60km north-west of Kyiv. Smoke can be seen pouring out of a residential building destroyed by the shelling and several houses appear to be heavily damaged in the fight as well as Russian military vehicles. The death toll from today’s shelling attack in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv has been updated to 33, the Ukrainian emergency services said. At least 33 bodies have been recovered from rubble in the wake of airstrikes by Russian forces on Chernihiv, it said in an online post. The previous estimate was 22. Rescue work has been temporarily suspended due to heavy shelling in the area, it said. Ukraine and Russia agreed to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks this afternoon, negotiators on both sides said. In the aftermath of the talks that took place on the Poland-Belarus border, the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said talks with Russia had not yielded the results Kyiv hoped for. But Podolyak said both sides envisaged a possible temporary ceasefire to allow for the evacuation of civilians. That is, not everywhere, but only in those places where the humanitarian corridors themselves will be located, it will be possible to cease fire for the duration of the evacuation. Both sides also reached an understanding on the delivery of medicines and food to the places where the fiercest fighting was taking place. Without elaborating, Podolyak said the outcome of today’s talks had fallen short of Ukraine’s hopes. On the Russian side, Russia’s main negotiator and former culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, said: The main question that we decided on today was the issue of saving people, civilians, who are in the zone of military clashes. Russia calls on civilians who find themselves in this situation, if military actions continue, to use these humanitarian corridors. Another Russian negotiator, the nationalist lawmaker Leonid Slutsky, said the agreements will be “implemented in the near future”. Today’s talks mark the first time Ukraine and Russia have agreed to any form of progress on any issue since Russia invaded Ukraine a week ago. A third round of talks is set to take place at the start of next week, the Belarus state news agency Belta cited Podolyak as saying. Here’s a bit more on Vladimir Putin’s speech this afternoon, where the Russian leader claimed military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. Putin’s televised comments appeared designed to rebut statements by western governments and intelligence agencies that the Russian advance has faltered in the face of logistical problems, tactical mistakes and fiercer-than-expected resistance from Ukraine. I want to say that the special military operation is proceeding strictly in line with the timetable. According to plan. All the tasks that have been set are being successfully resolved. He went on to give a number of examples of Russian soldiers’ “heroic” actions and said the families of Russian soldiers who had been killed during the fighting would be compensated. Now on Ukrainian territory, our soldiers and officers are fighting for Russia, for a peaceful life for the citizens of Donbas, for the denazification and demilitarisation of Ukraine, so that we can’t be threatened by an anti-Russia right on our borders that the west has been creating for years. A missile appeared to hit a residential building in central Chernihiv, northern Ukraine, in footage captured on dashcam. The state emergency service of Ukraine said an oil depot in Chernihiv was also on fire after being hit by a shell. Interpol has rebuffed Ukraine’s request to exclude Russia from its organisation, despite backing from both Britain and Poland who requested Russia’s suspension. A spokesperson for the Interpol general secretariat told the Guardian: Only the general assembly, Interpol’s supreme governing body comprising representatives from each of its 195 member countries, can vote on issues relating to membership. The Interpol general secretariat continues to monitor the situation concerning Ukraine closely. The International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, is a supranational body providing investigational support to member states, primarily through its red notice system that flags suspects internationally. Continuing to include Russia within Interpol grants security services access to the red notice database and potential broader support, despite accusations that Russia is a major abuser of the red notice system. Rights groups point to the ability of authoritarian regimes to abuse Interpol’s red notice system in order to flag political dissidents or exiles. Critics also point to the opacity of Interpol’s internal affairs, including allowing Syria to rejoin the organisation last year after a decade-long suspension. Ukraine’s minister for internal affairs, Denis Monastyrsky, wrote to Interpol earlier this week demanding Russia’s expulsion following its invasion of Ukraine. “Russia should be expelled from Interpol for violating its basic principles and massive misuse of tools and services to cover up its crimes and persecute political enemies, particularly in Ukraine,” he wrote, according to the Ukrainian broadcasting organisation Hromadske. Britain and Poland both backed Ukraine’s efforts, although they demanded that Interpol suspend Russia rather than exclude it. The British home secretary, Priti Patel, told parliament: The Ukrainian government has today requested that the Russian government be suspended from its membership of Interpol and we will be leading all international efforts to that effect. Poland’s police chief, Gen Jaroslaw Szymczyk wrote an impassioned personal letter to Interpol’s general secretary, Jürgen Stock. I strongly believe that the world needs a clear, consistent and unambiguous message that we, police officers from all over the world, do not accept the warfare actions taken by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Dear Jürgen. We have known each other for many years. We have talked many times about our dream of a safer world, the need to protect victims and to definitely prosecute those who stand on the other side of the law and the good. This is a great responsibility. Today, dear friend, the world is telling us “I call”. It is time to turn words into actions.” In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for the Interpol general secretariat said the organisation remained committed to ensuring that red notice requests from member states adhered to the organisations’ rules. In a Telegram group chat organised in answer to Ukraine’s government call for hackers to protect the country’s infrastructure from cyber-attacks and to conduct its own cyber missions, a hacking team called the Belarusian Cyber Partisans said it planned to target the Belarusian railway network, the news service reports. Belarus has been a critical staging point for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the country’s railway network being used to transport Russian soldiers, the Belarusian Cyber Partisans told Reuters. The “IT army” group chat also discussed targeting Russian telecom companies as well as Glonass – Russia’s satellite-based navigation system and alternative to GPS. “We need to mobilise and intensify our efforts as much as possible,” one post in the Telegram chat read. More than 237,000 people joined the Telegram channel in the days after Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, put out a call for the country’s hackers to join the cyberwar against Russia. “There will be tasks for everyone,” Fedorov tweeted. “We continue to fight on the cyber front. The first task is on the channel for cyber specialists.” A leader of Ukraine’s Muslim community, Sheikh Said Ismagilov, made an address to Russian Muslims serving as soldiers, asking: “Why did you come to kill us?” He said Ukraine does not need “saving” - as per Vladimir Putin’s rationale for his invasion - and asked Muslims around the world to support Ukraine’s fight for survival. Ukraine and Russia have agreed to hold a third round of talks soon, Reuters cites a Ukrainian negotiator as saying. The official said Ukraine did not receive the results it had counted on, but that both sides had reached an understanding on a joint provision of humanitarian corridors for evacuating civilians. Zelenskiy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted this : Ukrainian officials are warning that hackers have broken into local government websites to spread false reports that Ukraine has capitulated and signed a peace treaty with Moscow, Reuters reports. An undisclosed number of official websites of “regional authorities and local governments” have been hijacked and used to spread “lies” about a deal to end the fighting, Ukraine’s state service of special communication and information protection said. The agency said “the enemy” was responsible for the hacking spree. It was not immediately clear which websites it was referring to. Europe has already received one million refugees from Ukraine in the week since the war began and will receive millions more, the European commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, has said. She was speaking as EU interior ministers agreed on a temporary protection directive to grant Ukrainian nationals the right to live, work, and access healthcare, housing and education immediately for up to one year, without the need to go through lengthy asylum procedures. If the conflict continued, or refugees could return safely, that status could be extended for a further two years. It would not offer any such rights to people from elsewhere who were in Ukraine as temporary workers or students. The European commission’s original proposal was watered down in relation to “third country” nationals who have long-term residence in Ukraine: national asylum laws will apply to them. It is understood that Poland and Hungary were the most vocal in opposing the initial proposal. Thousands of people in cities across Russia have been defying police threats and staging protests against the invasion of Ukraine. Authorities have a low tolerance for demonstrations and marches, and attending them can have serious consequences including fines, arrests and even imprisonment. Vladimir Putin has accused Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields”. In a live address, the president described Russian soldiers as “real heroes”, and though he admitted to having “lost a few small towns”, he insisted that Russia’s special military operation was going “according to plan”. The “success” of the Russian army in Ukraine was an example of that “heroism”, Putin claimed. He said Ukrainians and Russians were “one people” but that Ukrainians were “threatened and brainwashed”. Putin went on to claim that Russian troops were providing humanitarian corridors for civilians to flee – in direct contradiction of what Ukraine has said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for direct talks with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, saying it was “the only way to stop this war”. Speaking at a press conference, the Ukrainian president addressed Putin: We are not attacking Russia and we do not plan to attack it. What do you want from us? Leave our land. Referring to the Russian leader receiving world leaders at a now-famous enormously long table, Zelenskiy said: Sit down with me. Just not 30 metres away like with [the French president, Emmanuel Macron]. He also called on the west to increase military aid to Ukraine, warning that the rest of Europe would be under threat if Russia was allowed to advance. If you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes! If we are no more, then God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next. Believe me. Russia has drawn up plans for public executions in Ukraine as and when cities are captured by Russian troops, Bloomberg reports. Bloomberg cites a European intelligence official as saying that Moscow has drafted strategies to break morale in order to discourage Ukrainians from fighting back as cities fall under the Kremlin’s control. The official said Moscow plans to crack down on protest, detain opponents and potentially carry out public executions, the news agency writes. The death toll from today’s shelling attack in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv has now reached 22, the Ukrainian emergency services said. The bodies of at least 22 civilians had been recovered from the rubble in the wake of Russian airstrikes, they said in an online post. Rescue work was ongoing, they added, but did not specify where exactly the attack took place. Earlier we reported that the governor of Chernihiv said at least nine people were killed and four wounded after the airstrike hit two schools and private houses. Local press said there were several schools, kindergartens and a hospital in the nearby area. Russian forces are closing in on two key nuclear power plants in the south of Ukraine, the acting head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said. Kotin said Ukraine still controls both plants including Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, but Russian troops have advanced to within 21 miles of the Zaporizhzhia plant and the South Ukraine power plant. The mayor of Enerhoda, in which the Zaporizhzhia plant is located, said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops for control of the south-eastern city. Russian troops were trying to break through a barricade to the plant erected by local residents and territorial defence forces, Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. Another adviser, Vadym Denysenko, described the situation as alarming. Russian forces took the Chernobyl plant last week. Speaking in an interview with Reuters, Kotin described Russia’s capture of the defunct nuclear power plant as “nuclear terrorism”. Six people have been rescued after a cargo ship sunk off the coast of Odesa due to an explosion, a senior Ukrainian official told Reuters. Earlier we reported the Estonian-owned cargo ship, Helt, had sunk this afternoon, with two crew members in a life raft at sea and four others unaccounted for, according to the shipping agency’s managing director. Victor Vyshniov, deputy head of Ukraine’s maritime administrator, has now said six crew members have been picked up by Ukraine’s rescue service. The six have been taken to hospital in nearby Chernomorsk due to being in cold water. Vyshniov provided no further details about the cause of the incident. While FMQs in the Scottish parliament this lunchtime has been dominated by domestic issues, there was inevitable discussion of the Ukraine crisis, Libby Brooks writes. On the subject of refugees, Nicola Sturgeon told the Holyrood chamber that there was a “moral, humanitarian obligation” to help those fleeing the war, adding that she wanted to “appeal directly to the prime minister to follow the example of the European Union and allow anyone fleeing the horror of Ukraine entry to the UK if they wish and deal with the paperwork later”. Sturgeon also pledged action on oligarchs in Scotland, after the Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer challenged her about Vladimir Lisin, a close associate of Putin who has received hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of agricultural subsidies for his 1,210 hectare (3,000 acre) estate in Scotland. Sturgeon said there would be an immediate review of such schemes, adding: I have sought urgent advice on the maximum possible action the Scottish government can take against individuals or entities identifying as having close links with the Russian regime … including ending support from the public purse and freezing assets. She said her government was also writing to Scottish businesses encouraging them to review and sever links with Russia. A second round of talks between Ukraine and Russia have started, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has confirmed. Mykhaylo Podolyak said he and other officials had begun talks with Russian delegates in Belarus. The Ukrainian delegation’s agenda is to agree an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to leave frontline communities. A Canadian-Israeli ice hockey player has described his harrowing escape from Ukraine, as foreign athletes in both Ukraine and Russia face life-threatening decisions over whether to stay or go. Eliezer Sherbatov was with his team, HC Mariupol, of the Ukrainian Hockey League, in the Donetsk region last week preparing for a game against Kramatorsk when a bomb exploded outside their hotel. “At 5am, I’m sleeping and hear: ‘Boom!’ You never hear that strong of a sound,” Sherbatov told TSN. “And it starts shaking, everything is shaking. So, a couple of metres away, the war started.” Sherbatov said the team’s coach called a meeting at breakfast, where he explained: “Guys - the war has started. It’s unfortunate, but I would suggest you to stay put as a team. But if you choose to leave, it’s your decision.’” Ukraine’s parliament has approved a bill to allow the seizure of assets or property in Ukraine owned by Russia or Russian citizens. Under the law, the government can suggest assets for confiscation to the security council, which must then approve their transfer to state ownership, Reuters reported. An advance team left the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague on Thursday to start investigating possible war crimes in Ukraine, its top prosecutor told Reuters in an interview. Their departure came hours after the prosecutor Karim Khan said he would start collecting evidence as part of a formal investigation launched after Russia’s full-scale invasion, which began on 24 February. “Yesterday I formulated a team and today they are moving to the region,” Khan said. “It’s an advanced team, comprised of investigators, lawyers, but also those with particular experience in operational planning.” Khan said his office would be examining possible war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide – the offences under the court’s jurisdiction – by all parties in the conflict. Neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of the ICC, and Moscow does not recognise the court, which was established in 1997 by the Rome Statute and opened in The Hague in 2002. Though not a member of the ICC, Ukraine signed a declaration in 2014 giving the court jurisdiction over alleged grave crimes committed on its territory from 2014 onwards regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators. Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means, in the French president’s words, “the worst is still to come” in Ukraine, saying Moscow was aiming to take “full control” by diplomatic or military means, according to the Elysée. As the number of refugees fleeing the conflict passed a million and Russian forces, backed by heavy shelling, advanced on cities and key ports in the south and east, Russia’s president said in a 90-minute call to his French counterpart he was “prepared to go all the way”, the senior French official said. Putin – who initiated the call – repeated that Moscow’s objective was the “neutralisation, demilitarisation and de-Nazification” of Ukraine, the official said, adding that Macron had responded that Putin was making a “major mistake” that would cost Russia dearly over the long term. “There was nothing in what President Putin said to reassure us,” the French official said. Macron had told the Russian president he was “lying to himself” and his country would end up “isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time”. “‘You are lying to yourself,’” Macron told Putin, the official said. “‘It will cost your country dearly, your country will end up isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time.’” • This post was amended on 3 March 2022. An earlier version mistakenly attributed the words “the worst is still to come” to Vladimir Putin, rather than Emmanuel Macron. Ukrainian negotiators have arrived by helicopter for talks with the Russian side in Belarus, the Russian state news agency TASS said. On Wednesday, Belarus’s foreign ministry posted a photo of a conference room, saying it had been set up to host a second round of talks. You may have seen a video on social media last week of a Ukrainian man removing a landmine with his bare hands, the cigarette dangling from his mouth reinforcing his apparent nonchalance. While his bravery was applauded, experts are worried about the message this and other similar videos send, Lizzy Davies writes. A spokesperson for the Halo Trust warns: We know from past experience that this doesn’t end well and we’re advising people to stay away. In order to try to raise awareness, the Halo Trust’s colleagues in the cities of Mariupol and Kramatorsk are putting up safety messages in bomb shelters aimed at those civilians who may be tempted to handle munitions and mines themselves. “These are deadly devices,” read the posters, which picture an array of munitions of different shapes and sizes. If you see anything like this or similar to this anywhere: DO NOT GO NEAR THEM. Do not pick them up. No matter what you see others do, these are not safe to touch. Call the local emergency authorities. At least nine people have been killed and four wounded after a Russian airstrike hit two schools and private houses in Ukraine’s Chernihiv region on Thursday, the governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said. In an online post, the Chernihiv governor said: Rescue work is ongoing. According to the state emergency services, there are for now nine people killed and four wounded. The Kyiv Independent reports that there were several schools, kindergartens and a hospital in the nearby area. A cargo ship has sunk off the Ukrainian port of Odesa after an explosion, Reuters is reporting. Two crew members of the Estonian-owned cargo ship Helt were in a life raft at sea, Igor Ilves, managing director of Tallinn-based manager Vista Shipping Agency, said. The four other crew members are missing, Ilves said. Ilves said: The vessel has finally sunk. Two of the crew are in a raft on the water and four others are missing. I don’t know where they are at the moment. Russian forces are attempting to prevent civilians in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol from evacuating, its mayor, Vadym Boichenko, has said. Local authorities say Russian troops are creating a “humanitarian catastrophe” by actively attacking rail links and bridges, as well as cutting off water and power supply, in a bid to prevent civilians from escaping shelling. Boichenko said in a video broadcast: The invaders are systematically and methodically trying to blockade the city of Mariupol. Constant attacks over the past 24 hours have meant the city has no light, water or heat and local authorities need a ceasefire to restore power, he said. Mariupol city council claimed the Russians are “hindering food supplies, blocking us like in Leningrad” in a statement. Russian soldiers are preventing authorities from evacuating the injured, women and children, the statement said. Boichenko added: We are being destroyed as a nation. This is the genocide of the Ukrainian people. These hypocrites came to ‘save’ Russian-speaking citizens of Mariupol and the region. But they arranged the extermination of Ukrainians -- Mariupol residents of Russian, Ukrainian, Greek and other origins. EU officials in Brussels have said they believe the Ukrainian figures in relation to the deaths of Russian soldiers are accurate, Daniel Boffey writes. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday morning that 9,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in the fighting since the invasion started on 24 February. On Wednesday, Moscow said that 498 Russian troops had been killed in Ukraine and 1,597 others wounded as it announced its own death toll for the first time. Amnesty International has documented three attacks that killed at least nine civilians, including children, in the city of Kharkiv on 28 February. The human rights organisation described the attacks in Ukraine’s second-biggest city, which took place around the same time that talks between Ukraine and Russia took place in Belarus, as “possible war crimes”. One of these attacks, which took place at 12.30pm local time in North Kharkiv, included Russian-manufactured 300mm Smerch rockets with 9N235 cluster munitions, indicating that the attack was launched by Russia, Amnesty said. At least four civilians were killed by the attack, including a child and three people collecting drinking water. Another attack that same day also involved a 300mm Smerch rocket on the city’s central Klochkivska Street. The impact of the strike blew the leg off a woman who had gone shopping during a break in the curfew. She died soon afterwards. A Ukrainian delegation is travelling by helicopter to meet Russian counterparts for a second round of talks, Reuters cites a Ukrainian presidential adviser as saying. Talks between Ukraine and Russia will kick off in a couple of hours, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in an online post. Earlier, Belarusian state news agency Belta quoted chief Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky as saying the second round of talks would start in Belarus at 1200 GMT. A Russian negotiator has previously said that a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. Russian forces have occupied the regional administration building in Kherson, regional governor Hennadiy Lahuta said, amid conflicting reports about the fate of the strategically important city. In a Facebook, Lahuta said staff had “not given up our duties”. The regional operational staff, which I head, continues to work and address pressing issues to help residents of the region. Russia’s defence ministry said it had captured Kherson on Wednesday but Ukraine has said its forces continue to defend the Black Sea port of about 250,000 people. Kherson’s mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said in a Facebook post early on Thursday that Russian troops were in control of the city hall and that residents should obey a curfew imposed by what he called the “armed visitors”. Kolykhaiev said he had made “no promises” to the Russian forces and that he was “only interested in the normal life of our city! I just asked [them] not to shoot people”. Other restrictions imposed on the city include a curfew from 8pm until 6am with only cars transporting food, medicines and other necessities permitted to enter the city. Hello. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you again as we unpack all the latest developments on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. German authorities have reportedly seized the $600m (£450m) superyacht belonging to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov in a Hamburg shipyard. Usmanov was on a list of billionaires to face sanctions from the European Union in response to Russia’s 24 February invasion of Ukraine. It came as the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said it had seized a yacht linked to Rosneft boss Igor Sechin in the Mediterranean port of La Ciotat. The finance ministry said the yacht was owned by an entity of which Sechin had been identified as the main shareholder. Usmanov’s 156-metre (512-foot) yacht Dilbar, valued at $600m and regarded as the largest motor yacht in the world by gross tonnage, was seized by German authorities on Wednesday, according to a Forbes report based on three sources in the yacht industry. The yacht has been in the yards of shipbuilding firm Blohm+Voss since late October. A spokesperson for shipbuilding firm Blohm+Voss declined to give a statement when contacted by the Guardian, but said that all projects by shipbuilder Lürssen would be treated “in accordance with the law”. The time is 1pm in Ukraine. Here is a round-up of the day’s main headlines so far: Ukraine’s defence lines were holding against the Russian attack, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his latest video, adding there had been no respite in Moscow’s shelling of Ukraine since midnight. Russian shelling and attacks on civilian populations killed 34 civilians in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region in the past 24 hours between 2-3 March, the emergency services said. A second round of talks is reportedly set to take place today. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. More than 1 million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. The UK’s ministry of defence says the Russian advance on Kyiv has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and remains more than 30km from the centre of the city. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said he believes some foreign leaders are preparing for war against Russia and that Moscow would press on with its military operation in Ukraine until “the end”. Lavrov also said Russia had no thoughts of nuclear war, The international criminal court (ICC) confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and begun collecting evidence. The United States has accused Russia of launching a “full war on media freedom and the truth” by blocking independent news outlets and preventing Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine. The situation in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is “difficult but under control”, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. Klitschko said there were no casualties overnight and that nighttime explosions were Ukrainian air defences striking down incoming Russian missiles. Russian troops are in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late last night. There are conflicting claims over whether Moscow had made its first major gain by taking over a significant Ukrainian city. Ukraine’s southern port of Mariupol is surrounded by Russian troops, interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. The council said it was seeking to create a humanitarian corridor for the city, as well as trying to restore infrastructure. “We are being destroyed as a nation. This is genocide of Ukrainian people,” it said. The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Russian and Belarusian athletes have been banned from the Winter Paralympic Games for their countries’ roles in the war in Ukraine, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has announced. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. Police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody of the children. In St Petersburg, Yelena Osipova, an activist said to have survived the infamous wartime siege of Leningrad was detained for protesting against the war. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. I’ll be back at 2pm London time but my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest on Putin’s war in Ukraine. A missile or bomb hit a Bangladeshi-owned cargo ship at the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Olvia, killing one of its crew members, and efforts were under way to rescue the others from the vessel, the state-run ship’s owner said on Thursday. “The ship came under attack and one engineer was killed,” Pijush Dutta, executive director of Bangladesh Shipping Corp, told Reuters. “It was not clear whether it was a bomb or missile or which side launched the attack. The other 28 crewmen are unharmed,” he said without providing further details. The Bangladesh-flagged Banglar Samriddhi had been stuck at the port of Olvia after Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February and had been hit by a missile, a Bangladesh foreign ministry official said earlier on Thursday. Crowds of Ukrainians formed a barrier on Wednesday between Russian forces and a nuclear plant in the city of Enerhodar, blocking their advance. Footage shared on social media by a Ukrainian official shows people – some holding Ukrainian flags – assembled in front of and around barricades of cars, trucks, tires and sandbags. Enerhodar is home to Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Ukraine’s southern port of Mariupol is surrounded by Russian troops, interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said on Thursday. “The occupiers want to turn it into besieged Leningrad,” he said, referring to Nazi Germany’s siege of the then-Soviet city, where about 1.5 million people died during two years of blockade. The European Union will take additional steps against Russia if the situation on the ground in Ukraine deteriorates, the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Thursday. The bloc is also preparing in case of Russian retaliation, including diversifying the bloc’s energy supplies, Reuters reported. “Our aim is to cut the Kremlin’s capacity to wage war on its neighbours,” Von der Leyen said after a meeting with the Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis. “We need to get independent from Russian gas, oil and coal. Our resolve to go forward in this case is stronger than ever,” she added. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said he believes some foreign leaders are preparing for war against Russia and that Moscow would press on with its military operation in Ukraine until “the end”. Lavrov also said Russia had no thoughts of nuclear war, according to a Reuters report. Offering no evidence to back up his remarks in an interview with state television, a week after Russia invaded Ukraine, he also accused the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, an ethnic Jew, of presiding over “a society where Nazism is flourishing”. He said he had no doubt that a solution to the crisis in Ukraine would be found, and a new round of talks were about to start between Ukrainian and Russian officials. But he said Russia’s dialogue with the west must be based on mutual respect, accused Nato of seeking to maintain supremacy and said that while Russia had a lot of good will, it could not let anyone undermine its interests. Moscow would not let Ukraine keep infrastructure that threatened Russia, he said. Moscow could also not tolerate what he said was a military threat from Ukraine, he said, adding that he was convinced that Russia was right over Ukraine. “The thought of nuclear is constantly spinning in the heads of western politicians but not in the heads of Russians,” he said. “I assure you that we will not allow any kind of provocation to unbalance us.” Russia did not feel politically isolated, and the question of how Ukraine lives should be defined by its people, he added. The situation in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is “difficult but under control”, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Thursday. Klitschko said there were no casualties overnight and that nighttime explosions were Ukrainian air defences striking down incoming Russian missiles, Reuters reported. He said a heating system site damaged by Russian shelling on Wednesday would be fixed during the day. Every weekend for most of her youth, while other children were out playing, Natalia Toroshenko attended Ukrainian school, studying the country’s geography, language, its history and national heroes. “Ukraine, and being Ukrainian, is a deep part of me,” she said. “I wasn’t born there, but it’s my ancestral homeland.” Toroshenko grew up in Montreal, thousands of kilometres away from the country her father had left to flee famine and conflict. But, she like many other Ukrainian Canadians, has maintained strong connections to the country – and watched horrified as family and friends are trapped in war. Canada is home to 1.4 million people of Ukrainian descent – the world’s second largest Ukrainian diaspora after Russia. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians farmed the country’s west. The spires of their churches still dot rural landscapes and large cities. Prominent community leaders and politicians are of Ukrainian ancestry, including Canada’s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland. Those cultural and political ties are particularly prominent in the Canadian Prairies, where generations of Ukrainians have braided their culture and history into the vast landscape. China has denounced a report that it asked Russia to delay invading Ukraine until after the Beijing Winter Olympics as “fake news” and a “very despicable” attempt to divert attention and shift blame over the conflict. Foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also repeated China’s accusations that Washington provoked the war by not ruling out Nato membership for Ukraine, the Associated Press reported. “We hope the culprit of the crisis would reflect on their role in the Ukraine crisis, take up their responsibilities, and take practical actions to ease the situation and solve the problem instead of blaming others,” Wang told reporters at a daily briefing. “The New York Times report is purely fake news, and such behaviors of diverting attentions and shifting blames are very despicable,” Wang said. The article cited a “western intelligence report” considered credible by officials. “The report indicates that senior Chinese officials had some level of direct knowledge about Russia’s war plans or intentions before the invasion started last week,” the Times wrote. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, met his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on 4 February, hours before the Games’ opening ceremony. Following that, the sides issued a joint statement in which they declared “friendship between the two states has no limits, there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation”. A war crimes investigation has been launched into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after an unprecedented number of countries backed the move and Boris Johnson called the military intervention “abhorrent”. Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor for the international criminal court (ICC), said he would begin work “as rapidly as possible” to look for possible crimes against humanity or genocide committed in Ukraine. The referral for investigation by 39 countries – including the UK – will shave several months off the process because it allows Khan to bypass the need to seek the approval of the court in The Hague. It came as Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, braced for a siege and the Russian defence ministry claimed it was in “complete control” of Kherson, a southern port city near the Crimean peninsula. Khan said an “advanced team” of investigators was already travelling to Ukraine. The British lawyer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the push for an inquiry by so many countries “allows us to jump-start investigations” and came on top of “evidence of international concern over events on the ground in Ukraine”. Germany is planning to deliver a further 2,700 anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine following a volte-face on its previously restrictive stance on exporting lethal weapons, German media reported on Thursday morning. The shoulder-fired “Strela” surface-to-air rockets, which once belonged to the old arsenal of the National People’s Army of Soviet-controlled East Germany, have been approved for export by Germany’s economic ministry but still await formal approval by the federal security council. The anti-aircraft missiles follow 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles that the German government announced over the weekend would be dispatched to Ukraine. In addition, the government of Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has green-lighted the delivery of weapons from Netherlands and Estonia that once belonged to East Germany. Meanwhile, the German foreign mMinister, Annalena Baerbock, called on Thursday for an urgent inquiry to investigate what she called human rights violations committed by Russia during its invasion of Ukraine. “We must stand up to this attack. Human rights are universal,” Baerbock said in a video message to the UN human rights ccouncil. Baerbock added that “we urgently need a commission of inquiry on Ukraine to investigate all violations of human rights that have been committed by Russia since its military aggression. We must stand strong on accountability.” A new UK visa scheme for the extended family members of British Ukranians comes into force from Friday, the Home Office has announced. The announcement came as security minister Damian Hinds denied there was a delay to the scheme, announced on Wednesday, which he said would help a “couple of hundred thousand” refugees. “There is absolutely no suggestion of any kind of delay here - people need help now,” he told Sky News. Asked how many visa applications had been submitted since last Wednesday, Hinds said: “So far a relatively small number - I can’t give you an exact number - but we expect that to grow rapidly.” The announcement was welcomed by British Ukrainians who have been trying to arrange visas for extended family fleeing the Russian invasion. Roman Lytwyniw, 25, who travelled to the Polish town of Przemyśl, near the border with Ukraine, to bring his 80-year-old grandmother back to the UK, said the family had been in limbo for two days, with embassy and Home Official officials unable to help with her visa application. Lytwyniw, a violinist from London, told the Guardian: “I’m not seeing anything yet from that [announcement]. Yesterday, they told me that I’m going to have to reapply for a visa because we didn’t meet the eligibility requirements. “I’ve just been to the British embassy here and they’ve told me that the best thing to do would be to travel to either Rzeszow or Warsaw. Because that’s where the nearest visa application centres are.” A petition calling on the UK government to waive visa requirements for Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion has now been signed by more than 100,000 people. EU leaders are expected to discuss and seek to find a common position on Ukraine’s membership application when they gather in Paris next Thursday for an informal summit, officials have said. Leaders will discuss “timing or the conditions”, with positions currently widely diverging among the 27 capitals. Georgia and Moldova are also expected to make formal applications “by the end of the week”, EU officials said. The EU must prepare for the arrival of millions of refugees as they flee war in Ukraine, the bloc’s top home affairs official said on Thursday. She added that she expected governments to agree a temporary protection scheme in the coming days. “Already, almost one million are here,” the EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, said, with women and children entering the European Union via Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, which all have land borders with Ukraine. Reuters reported that the bloc’s interior ministers were set to agree in principle at a meeting on Thursday to automatically grant those fleeing Ukraine a residence permit and access to employment, social welfare and housing for up to three years, they said. “Putin’s terrible war of aggression has had terrible consequences for people in Ukraine,” the German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said as she arrived at the Brussels meeting. “Today it is about all EU members agreeing on a policy to be able to provide help in a non-bureaucratic way.” The protective measures, once formally approved by EU governments in the coming week, will be granted to Ukrainians and those who had long-term residency or refugee status in Ukraine without them having to go through lengthy asylum procedures. Mariupol city council said Russia was constantly and deliberately shelling critical civilian infrastructure in the southern Ukrainian port, leaving it without water, heating or power and preventing bringing supplies or evacuating people. “They are breaking food supplies, setting us up in a blockade, as in the old Leningrad,” the council said in a statement, reported by the Reuters news agency. “Deliberately, for seven days, they have been destroying the city’s critical life-support infrastructure. We have no light, water or heat again.” The council said it was seeking to create a humanitarian corridor for the city, as well as trying to restore infrastructure. “We are being destroyed as a nation. This is genocide of Ukrainian people,” it said. Frans Timmermans, the European commission’s first vice-president, has said the UK has followed the EU’s lead but that the government needs to heed British public opinion and go further. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The UK is now following our lead... I think even parties who accepted funding from oligarchs should understand that they need to change course. Because, if I don’t misunderstand the mood in the UK, that’s what the British public want. On Wednesday, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, had questioned why Igor Shuvalov, formerly Vladimir Putin’s deputy prime minister, who now sits on the Russian security council, was not on the UK’s sanctions list but does appear on the EU equivalent. Russian anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny named Shuvalov as the owner of two luxury apartments in Whitehall Court. Damian Hinds, a minister in the Home Office, told the Today programme that “it is not a competition” when asked about the apparent failure of the UK government to go as far as its EU allies. A call by the Ukrainian embassy in Thailand for foreign volunteers to help fight against the Russian invasion has reportedly prompted dozens of inquiries. A Ukrainian embassy official told BenarNews that 40 people had turned up in person to ask about travelling to the country, while up to 100 people called to express interest on Wednesday. The embassy posted an appeal made by Volodymyr Zelenskiy for “friends of peace and democracy” to help Ukraine fight Russia. The statement, posted on its Facebook page, stated: “There is no greater contribution which you can make for the sake of peace.” The notice has reportedly struck a chord with Thais who participated in the pro-democracy protests that peaked in 2020. Among them is Chanaphong Phongpai, 28, who visited the Ukrainian embassy on Wednesday and spoke to Reuters about his reasons for wanting to fight for Ukraine. “They (Ukrainians) are also fighting for democracy and is now invaded by a superpower and a tyrant, so I asked myself what I can do for them,” he said. Thai government spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek told Reuters that there is no law preventing Thai citizens from joining foreign volunteer forces, but cautioned that people should consider the grave danger they could face on the ground. The Ukrainian embassy did not immediately respond to a request by the Guardian for comment. It has also set up bank accounts for people to donate in Thai baht. The Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, has declined to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, echoing the stance of many south-east Asian countries, which have issued mostly restrained statements on the matter. However, on Wednesday night Thailand was among 141 member states voted for a resolution deploring Russia’s actions and calling for the immediate withdrawal of its force. Ukrainian scientists have signed an open letter urging colleagues around the world to cut off collaboration with Russia. They are calling for an international boycott of scientific events inside Russia and say Russian researchers should be banned from accessing databases. More than 3,000 academics have signed the petition. Dmytro Chumachenko, an associate professor at the national aerospace university in the city of Kharkiv, now under Russian attack, shared the petition and asked his western colleagues to sign it. It reads: The Russian Federation has committed an insidious and completely shameful military attack on our country! In 2022, cruise missiles with cluster munitions and vacuum bombs that are banned in the civilized world are destroying residential areas, kindergartens, and hospitals in the very center of Europe! As of today, the number of dead civilians counts in hundreds (of which 16 are children), and thousands are wounded. The President of the Russian Federation threatens the world with nuclear weapons, which will obviously start the World War III. The armed forces and citizens defend Ukraine to the end! The whole world gives a worthy rebuff to the aggressor through the imposition of sanctions. At the same time, we believe that in this situation the progressive world scientific community should have its say. That is why we need your support right now. In our opinion, in the 21st century and 2022, perhaps the best answer to tanks, multiple rocket launchers, and rockets is closed access to high technologies, innovations, scientific research, and information support. Ukraine’s defence lines were holding against the Russian attack, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his latest video on Thursday, adding there had been no respite in Moscow’s shelling of Ukraine since midnight. “We have nothing to lose but our own freedom,” Zelenskiy said, adding Ukraine was receiving daily arms supplies from its international allies. He said it had been two years since Ukraine recorded its first Covid case: “It’s been a week now that another virus attacked,” he said of Russia’s invasion. As reported by Reuters, Zelenskiy said Russia’s changing tactics and shelling of civilians in cities proved Ukraine was successful in resisting Moscow’s initial plan of claiming a quick victory through a land assault. It comes as the UN human rights office has said 227 civilians had been killed and another 525 injured in Ukraine since Russia’s military invasion began a week ago. Residents in the key Black sea port of Odesa were stepping up preparations to defend it against a potential Russian amphibious landing, amid sightings of a convoy of Russian warships, and US warnings that a landing to target Odesa could happen as early as Thursday. Residents in the city reported on Thursday a marked increase in Russian airstrikes on Wednesday as images emerged of beaches close to the city laid with mines, and other defences being prepared. Concern of surrounding a potential amphibious landing targeting Odesa mounted on Thursday escalated following images of a Russian naval convoy depicting at least eight ships visible off the coast. The convoy appears to include a number of 4,080 tonne Ropucha-class large landing ships and supporting vessels. Two weeks ahead of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, several Ropucha class ships – which can each carry ten main battle tanks – entered the Black Sea under the guise of conducting drills along with a larger Ivan Gren class landing ship which can carry 13 tanks or 40 smaller armoured vehicles. The loss Odessa, Ukraine’s biggest port city would be an economic catastrophe for Ukraine. Ekho Moskvy radio station, one of Russia’s last remaining liberal media outlets, has been dissolved by its board after coming under pressure over its coverage of the war in Ukraine, its editor said on Thursday. The station, one of the leading news and current affairs channels in Russia, had been taken off the air two days earlier, Reuters reported. “The Ekho Moskvy board of directors has decided by a majority of votes to liquidate the radio channel and the website of Ekho Moskvy,” the Ekho Moskvy editor-in-chief, Alexei Venediktov, said on the messaging app Telegram. The move came after the prosecutor general’s office demanded this week that access be restricted to Ekho Moskvy and the TV Rain online news channel over their coverage of the conflict. The prosecutor said its move was prompted by their websites’ “targeted and systematic posting ... of information calling for extremist activities, violence and deliberately false information about the actions of Russian forces as part of a special operation” in Ukraine. Russia rejects the term invasion, and says its actions are not designed to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine’s military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists - a pretext rejected by Ukraine and the west as baseless propaganda. Ekho Moskvy said on Tuesday that the accusations against it were baseless and offensive, and it would fight them in the courts. Ukrainian diplomats formerly based in Moscow arrived in Latvia on Wednesday evening, Latvia’s foreign minister said. “Latvia welcomes Ukrainian diplomats who left Moscow and crossed Latvian-Russian border last night,” minister Edgars Rinkēvičs tweeted on Thursday. Latvia said on Saturday it would give refuge to the diplomats after receiving their plea for help, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Hungary has evacuated 32 people from its embassy in Kyiv, including some Hungarian embassy staff, two journalists, 10 South African and 10 Nigerian nationals, the Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said on Thursday. He said the evacuated embassy staff and foreign nationals crossed over into Hungary overnight. The Australian government has asked Facebook, Twitter, Google and other digital platforms to block content generated by Russian state media to curb “disinformation in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. Australia’s communications minister, Paul Fletcher, wrote on Thursday to Meta, which runs Facebook and Instagram, and a range of other digital platforms, asking them to take action “as a priority to suspend the dissemination on your platform[s] in Australia of content generated by Russian state media organisations”. The other recipients are Apple, TikTok, Twitter, Snap Inc, Reddit, Google and Microsoft. Fletcher cited “a significant volume of such content promoting violence, extremism and disinformation in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. Australia is not the first government to make the request, with the European Union’s own ban on Russian state media prompting a number of platforms to crack down on Kremlin-backed news outlets RT and Sputnik. Russian shelling and attacks on civilian populations killed 34 civilians in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region in the past 24 hours between 2-3 March, the emergency services said on Thursday. Separately, Reuters reported that the governor of the Ukraine-controlled eastern Donetsk region said the port city of Mariupol, one of the first targets of the Russian invasion, was without electricity or water supplies. The Lithuanian prosecutor general’s office said on Thursday it had begun investigating suspected crimes against humanity and war crimes in Ukraine following Russia’s invasion. “The investigation was launched with regards to the military aggression in Ukraine,” it said in a statement reported by the Reuters news agency. The probe will include “military attacks on civilians, doctors, destruction of homes, hospitals, educational institutions and other civilian facilities, which lead to deaths of adults and children,” it said. Here is a round-up of some of the images from the fallout of Putin’s war in Ukraine today. The Russian military is a “ruthless invading force” which poses a danger immediately to Ukraine, but also to “wider Europe and the world”. Damian Hinds, the UK’s security minister, told Sky News: How concerned am I? We are all desperately concerned. This is a ruthless invading force. When it comes to tactics and military strategy, I’m not going to second guess Vladimir Putin and what he might be thinking, what might be in his head. But we do know that this is a ruthless force, an extremely dangerous (force) obviously imminently right now for Ukraine, but actually dangerous for wider Europe and the world. The bravery, the tenacity of Ukraine, my God, we have all been taken aback and it is so important we do everything we can to support them in what they are doing and make sure - and this is where the sanctions, we’ve got the Economic Crime Bill, transparency and enforcement coming through on Monday in Parliament. It is why all these things are so important, why we absolutely need to make the regime hurt. Russian and Belarusian athletes have been banned from the Winter Paralympic Games for their countries’ roles in the war in Ukraine, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has announced. The U-turn comes less than 24 hours after the IPC said it would allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete when the Games open on Friday, but only as neutral athletes with colours, flags and other national symbols removed. The IPC received immediate criticism for its initial decision, the Associated Press reported. It soon became evident that many athletes would refuse to compete against Russians or Belarusians. IPC President Andrew Parsons, in announcing the initial measures Wednesday in a Beijing news conference, sympathised openly with the Ukrainian people but said his actions were constrained by his organisation’s rules and the fear of legal action. Parsons said almost the opposite in announcing his reversal, noting his constituents had pushed back. “In the last 12 hours, an overwhelming number of members have been in touch with us,” Parsons said in a statement. “They have told us that if we do not reconsider our decision, it is now likely to have grave consequences.” Parsons added: What is clear is that the rapidly escalating situation has now put us in a unique and impossible position so close to the start of the Games. Germany is considering supplying 2,700 anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine as it seeks to defend itself against an invasion by Russia, a government source said on Thursday. German news agency DPA reported earlier that the economy ministry had approved supplying the Soviet-made Strela missiles, part of the inventories of the former German Democratic Republic’s army. A source told Reuters that the Federal Security Council had yet to approve the move. “The missiles are ready to be transported,” the source said. That would come on top of 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles that Germany said on Saturday it would supply to Ukraine, in a shift of policy after Russia invaded its neighbour. Hello. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news on Putin’s war in Ukraine over the next few hours. It is 9.30am in Ukraine on the eighth day of Putin’s war. Here is where the crisis currently stands: A second round of talks is reportedly set to take place today. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. The UK’s ministry of defence says the Russian advance on Kyiv has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and remains more than 30km from the centre of the city. The international criminal court (ICC) confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and begun collecting evidence. The United States has accused Russia of launching a “full war on media freedom and the truth” by blocking independent news outlets and preventing Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s central bank has imposed a 30% commission on foreign currency purchases by individuals on currency exchanges, brokers told Reuters, citing a letter from the regulator. Russian troops are in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late last night. There are conflicting claims over whether Moscow had made its first major gain by taking over a significant Ukrainian city. The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Explosions were reported in Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday following Russian airstrikes. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. Police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody of the children. In St Petersburg, Yelena Osipova, an activist said to have survived the infamous wartime siege of Leningrad was detained for protesting against the war. More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said. Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion. Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties. The UK’s ministry of defence says the Russian advance on Kyiv has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and remains more than 30km from the centre of the city. The latest intelligence report reads: The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km from the centre of the city having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion. The column has made little discernible progress in over three days. Despite heavy Russian shelling, the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol remain in Ukrainian hands. Some Russian forces have entered the city of Kherson but the military situation remains unclear. The report added that the Russian defence ministry “has been forced to admit” that 498 Russian soldiers have already been killed and 1,597 wounded in Putin’s war, adding that the actual number of those killed and wounded “will almost certainly be considerably higher” and will continue to rise. Quick snap here from Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov. Suited up in khaki attire, the minister gave a tribute to the Ukrainian people. Hungary will not veto European Union sanctions against Russia and the unity of the 27-member bloc is “paramount” amid the war in Ukraine, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said. In an interview with news website mandiner.hu, Orban said: As far as sanctions are concerned, we will not veto, we will not prevent the EU from imposing sanctions on Russia. EU unity is now paramount.” Orban added that Hungary’s ties with Russia had been “balanced and fair” until the very recent past, but the war has created a new situation. He added, however, that there was no reason to cut energy ties with Moscow. If we abolished energy cooperation with the Russians, the overhead costs of all Hungarian families would triple in a single month. I therefore do not support this move, let Hungarian families not pay the price of the war.” Nearly 15,000 Russian tourists are stuck in the Dominican Republic due to travel restrictions imposed after Moscow’s invasion of its neighbour, the government in Santo Domingo said Wednesday, according to a report from Agence France-Presse. The Caribbean country said it had reached a deal with hotel chains to “guarantee” the tourists’ accommodation “until such time as a solution is found.” The 14,800 Russian tourists are mainly in the eastern province of La Altagracia, home to visitor hotspot Punta Cana. Some 1,900 Ukrainian visitors are also in the country and will remain in their hotels until a repatriation plan is in place. Ukraine’s honorary consul to the Dominican Republic, Ilona Oleksandrivna, has claimed there were some 3,000 of her countrymen and women in the country, of whom 1,200 had been kicked out of their hotels. AFP said they found no stranded foreigners in the main tourist areas. While Russian forces threaten new attacks, the basement of a Kyiv hospital has transformed into a maternity ward, where expecting and new mothers bring new life into a world violently upended by a Russian military invasion. Alina Shinkar is 32 weeks pregnant with her first child. She was admitted to one of Kyiv’s maternity hospitals two weeks ago because of pregnancy complications. “I woke up on the 24th of February, at 5 o’clock in the morning from the hit, that I heard. The explosion. And then I heard women started to cry and scream. The war started.’” Watch Alina’s story in the video below. Pro-Russian forces may launch targeted strikes on the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol unless Ukrainian forces there surrender, the Interfax news agency quoted Donetsk separatist commander Eduard Basurin as saying on Thursday. Russia and separatists say they have encircled the city of 430,000 located on the Azov Sea coast. However, an operational update published by the Ukrainian military this morning said the city remains in Ukrainian hands. The International Criminal Court earlier confirmed that it is opening an investigation into the situation in Ukraine. In a statement published to the ICC website, prosecutor, Karim AA Khan QC writes: On 28 February, I announced my decision to seek authorisation to open an investigation into the Situation in Ukraine, on the basis of my Office’s earlier conclusions arising from its preliminary examination, and encompassing any new alleged crimes falling within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (“ICC” or “the Court”). In the same statement, I indicated that active investigations by my Office would be significantly expedited if a State Party to the Rome Statute (the “Statute”) were to refer the situation to my Office, as provided in article 14 of the Statute... I have notified the ICC Presidency a few moments ago of my decision to immediately proceed with active investigations in the Situation. Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced. In total, 39 ICC states have referred atrocities for investigation. German authorities reportedly seized the $600m superyacht belonging to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov in a Hamburg shipyard on Wednesday. Usmanov was on a list of billionaires to face sanctions from the European Union in response to Russia’s 24 February invasion of Ukraine. A Forbes report based on three sources in the yacht industry said his 156-metre (512-foot) yacht Dilbar, valued at $600m and regarded as the largest motor yacht in the world by gross tonnage, was seized by German authorities on Wednesday. If you missed our earlier report you can read the full story below. The United States has accused Russia of launching a “full war on media freedom and the truth” by blocking independent news outlets and preventing Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine. The US State Department said in a statement as reported by Reuters: Russia’s government is also throttling Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram platforms that tens of millions of Russia’s citizens rely on to access independent information and opinions.” Russians also used social media to connect to each other and the outside world, it added. The agency called on Putin and the Russian government to immediately “cease this bloodshed” and withdraw troops from Ukraine. A compilation of video footage taken by those currently in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson show Russian troops patrolling the city streets. Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, confirmed Russian forces had landed in the city in a Facebook post written about 10pm on Wednesday. “There were armed visitors in the city council today. My team and I are peaceful people, we had no weapons or aggression on our side.” You can watch the footage below. The soaring cost of oil and other key commodities in the wake of the invasion threatens to unleash another bout of damaging inflation and supply shortages on the global economy. The price of benchmark Brent crude oil added another 3.4% in early trade on Thursday to climb to $116.80. The cost of other crucial commodities such as aluminum (2.62%), iron ore (7.75%), copper (1.6%) and wheat (7%) were also on an upward curve, thanks to tighter supplies but also bulk buying by the Chinese government, according to analysts. Tina Teng, markets analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, said commodity prices would keep rising. The Russia-Ukraine war has been pumping up global commodity prices, not only because of the supply disruption, but also resulting from hedging activities. Markets have priced in for a much tighter oil supply, with oil tankers and shippers in a standoff for Russia’s exports. China has also ordered the state-owned buyers to store major commodities, including oil, gas, iron ore and agriculture products. Crude oil futures are heading toward $US120 a barrel. There was also concern about stagflation, where growth falls and prices rise. Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at fund manager AMP in Sydney, said: Russia supplies around 30% of Europe’s gas and oil imports and accounts for around 11% of world oil production. In short, investors are worried about a stagflationary shock. Wrapping it all up, our economics editor looks at the threat of a global recession. The Ukrainian military claims Russian troops have been “unsuccessful in almost all directions in which they were advancing”, according to an operational update published this morning. The force added that shelling of residential neighbourhoods in major cities continued overnight while Russian troops pushed forward towards the northern outskirts of Kyiv and Mariupol. According to the Ukrainian military, some Russian troops are requiring the urgent replacement of equipment and personnel, however the Guardian has been unable to confirm these reports. The Russian Federal Security Service leaked information that alerted Ukraine to an assassination plot against president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to the cyber-hacking collective Anonymous. In a recently published tweet, the group said: Russian FSB leaked information alerted Ukraine to assassination plot against President @ZelenskyyUa. Now, we can expect an internal power struggle within the Kremlin to overthrow the Putin regime. In the meantime, let’s continue with the attacks,” the tweet read. Anonymous also claimed responsibility for taking down the Russian Space Agency website for a second time. Russia’s central bank has imposed a 30% commission on foreign currency purchases by individuals on currency exchanges, brokers have told Reuters, citing a letter from the regulator. There was no comment from the central bank but it follows a turbulent few days for financial markets in Russia in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. The rouble has plunged in value, forcing the central bank to double its key interest rate to 20% in order to protect the currency from speculation. The levy on forex also appears to be a move to prevent trade in the rouble and ringfence the Russian financial system. Russian troops are in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late last night. According to the New York Times, the city northwest of the Crimean peninsula, has been captured by Russians. The city’s mayor, and US intelligence have contested that it has fully been overtaken. In a Facebook post written about 10pm on Wednesday, Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, said: There were armed visitors in the city council today. My team and I are peaceful people, we had no weapons or aggression on our side. We don’t have Ukrainian Armed Forces in the city, only civilians and people who want to LIVE here! The developments follow a day of conflicting claims over whether Moscow had made its first major gain by taking over a significant Ukrainian city. Kolykhaiev indicated he negotiated with the invading troops. I made no promises to them. I just have nothing to promise. I am only interested in the normal life of our city! I just asked not to shoot people. Other restrictions imposed on the city include aa curfew from 8pm until 6am with cars transporting food, medicines and other necessities permitted to enter the city. Public transport is set to restart soon and pedestrians are being told to “walk one by one, maximum two’. “The military will not be provoked. Stop at the first demand. They do not conflict,” Kolykhaiev said. We have shown that we are working to secure the city and are trying to eliminate the consequences of the invasion. So far this is how it is. Ukrainian flag above us. And to keep it the same, these requirements must be met.” Earlier, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said: “We’re not in a position to call it either way. It appears to us that the Ukrainians are certainly fighting over that town.” More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. Filippo Grandi said in a post over Twitter on Thursday: In just seven days we have witnessed the exodus of one million refugees from Ukraine to neighbouring countries. For many millions more, inside Ukraine, it’s time for guns to fall silent, so that life-saving humanitarian assistance can be provided.” It is the swiftest refugee exodus this century, the United Nations added. The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, the second biggest in Europe, housing six of the country’s 15 reactors. In their letter to the IAEA, Russian officials insisted that Ukrainian staff at the plant were continuing to “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation”. Read the full story below. Heartbreaking images have emerged of Ukrainians fleeing their country en route to Poland. More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. Many have made the journey by bus. Hello, I’m Samantha Lock and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. It is 7am in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency said. Russian troops moved in to the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late Wednesday. Explosions were reported in Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday following Russian airstrikes. Two blasts reportedly went off in the city centre, followed by two more near a metro station, as Russia steps up its offensive and moves forces closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. The international criminal court (ICC) confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and begun collecting evidence. The ICC process was sped up after 38 countries formally referred reports of atrocities to it, the largest referral the court has ever received. The strategically important Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol is reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. “We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from apartments, since the shelling does not stop,” its mayor said. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. Police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody of the children. In St Petersburg, Yelena Osipova, an activist said to have survived the infamous wartime siege of Leningrad was detained for protesting against the war. Russian paratroopers landed in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, following several days of bombardment that has killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Four more people died on Wednesday, local authorities said, adding the city was still under their control. More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said. Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion. Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties. The UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces. On Wednesday, 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained and five – Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – voted against. A second round of talks is reportedly to get under way on Thursday. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. Police in Poland warned that fake reports of violent crimes being committed by people fleeing Ukraine are circulating on social media after Polish nationalists attacked and abused groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern people who had crossed the border.

With opinion polls and bookmakers’ odds showing Truss the clear favourite to move into 10 Downing Street next week, officials are drawing up plans that would allow the new government to move quickly over bills and longer-term reforms of the energy market. Truss has said she wants to announce a package by the end of September but parliament will go into recess on 22 September for the party conference season. That would leave the chancellor, expected to be Kwasi Kwarteng, with little more than a fortnight to choose from a range of measures. The Treasury accepts that the £15bn package of support announced by Rishi Sunak in May will be inadequate given the subsequent rise in the cap on average household energy bills and likelihood of a further big increase in January. It has picked up signals from the Truss camp that she intends to do more to help households facing rocketing gas and electricity bills this winter. The new chancellor will be given a detailed briefing that will include forecasts for the cap, the likely impact on bills, the impact on different groups of households, and ways of targeting support. The mini package of measures would include cuts in national insurance contributions, the scrapping of planned increases in corporation tax, and temporary removal of green levies from energy bills – all of which have featured prominently in Truss’ campaign – plus additional measures thought necessary in view of the 80% increase in the energy price cap to more than £3,500 expected on 1 October. Truss’ tax pledges alone have been costed at £30bn. Sources said the civil service was examining proposals from the two Tory leadership candidates, with the government machine ready to respond “very quickly” once the new prime minister was chosen. Options will include making the scheme that Sunak announced in May more generous and more closely focused on low-income households. Choices also include changes to universal credit, and a scheme that was proposed by Stephen Fitzpatrick, the head of Ovo, Britain’s third largest largest energy provider, which would cut households’ energy bills for limited usage. Under this plan energy consumption above a certain level would be charged at a higher price; Fitzpatrick said the scheme would channel support towards poorer consumers because high-income households typically used more energy. The need for speed will probably mean a full budget will be pencilled in for later in the autumn, by which time the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will be ready with fresh forecasts for the economy and public finances. A date for the emergency budget has not yet been set, but 21 September has been mooted. If Truss wins the leadership contest she would be flying back from New York City on that day after attending a meeting of the UN general assembly. Kwarteng, at present the business secretary, has recently been in close contact with UK energy companies and has been looking at ways of tackling some of the structural problems with Britain’s wholesale energy markets. Two possible reforms have floated by the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi. The energy regulator, Ofgem, announced this month it was changing the methodology of its price cap to enable suppliers to recoup wholesale energy hedging costs sooner – a move that will add several hundred pounds to bills in order to stop energy providers going bust. Zahawi said he was working with the Bank of England to “provide better liquidity in the wholesale market for energy”, which could help reduce the price cap by £400 to £500. Kwarteng is thought to support this initiative and a separate plan that would involve the renegotiation of contracts with some renewable energy suppliers to reflect the fact that their profit margins have soared during the crisis. Some industry watchers have suggested renegotiating existing “renewables obligations certificates” for nuclear power stations, windfarms and biomass projects in favour of contracts for difference, which would cut prices and offer long-term stable revenues for power producers. The industry body Energy UK said such a proposal could reduce energy bills for homes and businesses. In an interview with Sky, Zahawi said he was considering the option of an agreement with companies developing power from other sources, such as renewables, for “a voluntary contract for difference … at a lower price”, but said that would “not be ready until next winter”. Zahawi said: “There are no easy options. That’s the one thing we know.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/09/solar-panels-trial-wimbledon-berries-kent-hugh-lowe-farms","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-09T16:40:17Z","webTitle":"A greener greenhouse: solar panels trialled on Wimbledon berries farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/09/solar-panels-trial-wimbledon-berries-kent-hugh-lowe-farms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/09/solar-panels-trial-wimbledon-berries-kent-hugh-lowe-farms","fields":{"headline":"A greener greenhouse: solar panels trialled on Wimbledon berries farm","bodyText":"Tennis fans tucking into strawberries at Wimbledon this month may find their fruit has an unusual origin – a solar-powered greenhouse. Transparent panels have been attached to the sides of glasshouses in Kent as part of a trial to build up solar power supplies without using more land. Hugh Lowe Farms, which supplies fruit to the annual tennis tournament and major supermarkets, is hosting the study by researchers at the University of Greenwich. The trial, which has received £250,000 in government funding, began late last year and has taken on more significance since the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine threw a spotlight on domestic energy supplies. It is hoped the energy generated can be used to power automatic watering and temperature-control equipment, as well as housing for workers on farms. Ministers are keen for Britain to ramp up energy production, and have set a target of increasing solar output five-fold to 70 gigawatts by 2035. Dr Elinor Thompson, a photosynthesis researcher from the University of Greenwich who is leading the research, said the initiative was a “no-brainer”. “It looked like a great collaboration before the energy crisis. Over time it’s become incredibly pertinent to produce your own power. Farms are often in remote locations so it’s useful to have your own power source as well as helping the planet,” she said. The idea may also appease residents who object to the sight of solar panels covering the countryside, and allow farmers to use space that might have been allocated for panels to grow crops. Thompson said: “The public understandably never want to see land covered in solar panels so this is a pragmatic way to retrofit solar on to existing structures. “It’s helping farms to reduce their carbon footprint, which supermarkets are keen to see, and the government also wants the UK to reduce its carbon footprint as a whole.” The vertical photovoltaic panels are semi-transparent and affixed to the sides of the glasshouse, allowing some light through to the fruit, as well as through the roof. The trial will on Friday be extended to flexible panels attached to the side of polytunnels. The study concludes next spring and a further stage of research to prove the technology can replicated at a larger scale could follow. Thompson said the fruit was unaffected by the presence of the existing panels and that she hoped to ultimately study the impact of new coloured panels on the fruit. She said that light coming through orange-coloured panels could lead to leafier plants. Hugh Lowe Farms’ managing director, Marion Regan, said the company was attempting to cut its emissions. “Generating electricity in field while growing crops will help achieve our goals,” she said. The government’s energy security strategy, published in April, set out plans for a major acceleration in homegrown power through renewables including solar, onshore wind and nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/26/german-windfarm-coalmine-keyenberg-turbines-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-26T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"Stop dismantling German windfarm to expand coalmine, say authorities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/26/german-windfarm-coalmine-keyenberg-turbines-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/26/german-windfarm-coalmine-keyenberg-turbines-climate","fields":{"headline":"Stop dismantling German windfarm to expand coalmine, say authorities","bodyText":"Governing authorities in Germany have urged one of the country’s biggest energy companies to stop dismantling a wind park to make way for an open-pit mine, after activists said the move symbolised a rollback of the government’s climate protection plans. Consisting of eight turbines, the Keyenberg wind park in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia is located about half a mile from the edge of a 48 km² surface mine, named after the local village of Garzweiler. One of the turbines was dismantled last week to make way for the mine’s expansion, with two others to be taken down in the first and last quarter of next year, said a spokesperson for WPD, which manages a portion of the wind park. A spokesperson for Energiekontor, which built and runs the rest of the windfarm, said a time limit to its operational permit meant it expected to have to dismantle the five remaining turbines by the end of 2023. Given that Olaf Scholz’s coalition government has pledged to expand energy production massively from renewable sources under its tenure, and with German citizens this winter worried about power cuts amid a decline in Russian gas deliveries, the energy company that owns the Garzweiler mine said it was aware that dismantling windfarms sent a confusing message. “We realise this comes across as paradoxical,” said Guido Steffen, a spokesperson for RWE. “But that is as matters stand.” Rebuilding the turbines to make way for the expanding mine was part of the original agreement that allowed the windfarm to be constructed in 2001, he added, and not a result of a recent change of German energy policy. Germany’s cabinet passed a decree last month to bring back idled brown coal capacity up to next summer to boost supply, as imports of Russian gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline ground to a standstill. Constructed more than 20 years ago, the turbines at the small Keyenberg wind park are less powerful than modern equivalents, with each producing about 1MW of energy per hour at a wind speed of 15 metres per second, roughly a sixth of the output of a more efficient state of the art turbine. Since windfarms in Germany are no longer eligible for subsidies after 20 years in operation, the park would probably have been “repowered” with new technology or wound down even if it were not for the nearby mine. Nonetheless, North-Rhine Westphalia’s ministry for economic and energy affairs on Monday urged RWE to abort its plans to dismantle the windfarm. “In the current situation, all potential for the use of renewable energy should be exhausted as much as possible and existing turbines should be in operation for as long as possible,” a spokesperson said. “We don’t currently see any necessity to dismantle the wind power plant by the L12 [country road] near the Garzweiler surface mine.” The ministry said it informed RWE of its opinion last week. This month, RWE and North-Rhine Westphalia’s Green-run economic ministry reached a deal for the energy company to turn off two power plants in 2030, eight years earlier than the current legal framework foresees. In exchange, RWE is allowed to extend the running time of two other plants until 2024. Climate activists have accused the Green party of betraying their cause. The dismantling of the turbine, activists said last week, was symbolic of the government reneging on its climate promises as it turned to fossil-fuels and coal in the face of a looming energy crisis. “While our politicians argue about the extension of nuclear power, Germany’s rollback in climate protection is going unnoticed,” said Alexandra Brüne of the local initiative Alle Dörfer Bleiben (All Villages Stay), an alliance of activists lobbying for the preservation of the villages on the edge of the Garzweiler mine. “Our region is being devastated, the climate is spiralling out of control – and now the wind turbines are being dismantled for more coal,” Brüne said. “We are seeing an energy transition rollback in the middle of the climate catastrophe, it’s absurd.” Shortly after being sworn in last December, Germany’s left-liberal “traffic light” coalition government announced its intention to boost renewables expansion after years of sluggish growth. The economic and energy ministry, led by the Green party, has committed Germany’s 16 federal states to provide 2% of their landmass for wind energy over the next 10 years. Nature protection laws have been trimmed with the intention of speeding up planning applications for wind parks near bird nesting sites. With the new rules still to trickle down to the country’s 16 federal states, wind energy companies say the effect of these changes has yet to materialise. About 365 turbines were built in Germany between January and September, a year-on-year increase of 5.5%. The number of wind projects that were approved over the same period has gone down, however 524 turbines were granted building permission, a year-on-year decrease of 16.2%. During his victorious campaign for the federal German vote last September, Scholz said it should be possible to build new windfarms in six months rather than six years. But as of 21 October this year, the planning application for a windfarm in Germany still takes 23 months on average. The German Wind Energy Association calculates that about 10,000MW of power from renewables are stuck in the administrative process. “These projects have to be quickly authorised by the end of the year so that expansion can be can gain new dynamism over the coming years,” said the chief executive, Wolfram Axthelm. • This article was amended on 27 October 2022 to correct the detail of the energy production of the Keyenberg wind park turbines."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jan/14/france-edf-cap-household-energy-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-14T13:42:13Z","webTitle":"France to force EDF to take €8.4bn hit with energy bill cap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/14/france-edf-cap-household-energy-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jan/14/france-edf-cap-household-energy-bills","fields":{"headline":"France to force EDF to take €8.4bn hit with energy bill cap","bodyText":"The French government will force EDF, the state energy giant, to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill hikes to 4% this year. The company lost a fifth of its market value on Friday after the French government set out plans to cap rising energy bills, which include forcing EDF to sell electricity generated by its fleet of nuclear reactors to rival home suppliers at well below the current record high market prices. The move underlines pressure on governments across Europe to help households squeezed by the cost-of-living crisis. The UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been accused of being “missing in action” over soaring energy bills. He has been in talks with MPs and companies to agree a package of measures to soften the blow of the national energy crisis, but no decisions have been made. In Spain, the government introduced a windfall tax on electricity generators and gas producers that are able to profit from the record market highs to help keep home energy bills low. In Germany, the government has slashed a surcharge on bills used to support renewable energy schemes, which will instead receive extra state subsidies drawn from higher carbon taxes. EDF also told investors that its nuclear power generation for the year ahead would be about 10% lower than initially expected due technical problems at a handful of its nuclear reactors. The French government, which faced fierce public protest against fuel price hikes in 2018, has already cut some electricity taxes to help slow the rise in home energy bills at an estimated €8bn cost to the state. Governments across Europe are under pressure to intervene in the energy market to protect households against an unprecedented surge in wholesale market prices, driven by a global gas supply crunch that has lifted markets to all-time highs. Under the French government’s new measures, it has kept a tight lid on the regulated price that EDF is allowed to charge for its nuclear electricity, which will rise to €46.2 per megawatt-hour, from €42/MWh, despite a record surge in electricity market prices across Europe in recent months. EDF said the plan could hit its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by between €7.7bn and €8.4bn based on market prices in December and January. Barbara Pompili, France’s environment minister, said the government planned to help EDF withstand the blow but has offered no details on this. The nuclear power giant also told investors that its reactors would generate less electricity than expected this year. This is because of a string of faults at five of its nuclear plants which will require downtime to undertake maintenance work. EDF estimates that it will generate 300-330 terawatt-hours this year, down from 330-360 TWh previously. The company’s share price tumbled from €10.35 at Thursday’s close to €7.92 on Friday morning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/07/russia-targets-zaporizhzhia-with-kamikaze-drones-for-the-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-07T13:04:58Z","webTitle":"Russia targets Zaporizhzhia with ‘kamikaze drones’ for the first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/07/russia-targets-zaporizhzhia-with-kamikaze-drones-for-the-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/07/russia-targets-zaporizhzhia-with-kamikaze-drones-for-the-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Russia targets Zaporizhzhia with ‘kamikaze drones’ for the first time","bodyText":"Russia has targeted Zaporizhzhia with explosive-packed “kamikaze drones” for the first time, as the death toll from a missile strike on an apartment building in the city rose to 11. The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones damaged two infrastructure facilities, in the city. He said other missiles also struck the city again, injuring one person. With its army losing ground to Ukraine’s counteroffensive, Moscow has started to deploy drones to attack Ukrainian targets. According to Ukrainian military officials, “kamikaze drones” are cheaper and less sophisticated than missiles but have proved effective at causing damage to targets on the ground. The Shahed-136 drones are able to remain airborne for several hours and circle over potential targets before being flown into enemy troops, armour or buildings and exploding on impact. On Monday, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani denied supplying the drones to Russia, calling the claims “baseless”. However, the Ukrainian military said its forces had shot down more than 20 drones over the last 24 hours and that most were Iranian-made. On Wednesday, Russia allegedly deployed another six drones to bombard Bila Tserkva, a city about 55 miles (90km) from Kyiv, injuring one person, according to the regional governor. “This is a new threat for all the defence forces [of Ukraine] and we need to use all available means to try to counter it,” the Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said, comparing the drone’s small size with an artillery shell. Kyiv says Moscow started using Iranian drones in September, targeting electrical power stations, electricity transmission lines and waterworks with long-range weaponry. According to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, the Iranian drones are unlikely to significantly affect the course of the war. “They have used many drones against civilian targets in rear areas, likely hoping to generate non-linear effects through terror. Such efforts are not succeeding,” wrote analysts at the thinktank. Ukraine’s state emergency service said the death toll from missile strikes on Zaporizhzhia city on Thursday had increased to 11 after seven rockets were fired before dawn into residential buildings. At least 15 people are still missing, according to city officials. “There are neither military nor important objects near the hit site, only civilian buildings and apartment buildings,” Starukh said. Thursday’s attacks came a day after Russia said it considered the whole of Zaporizhzhia province, including Zaporizhzhia city, part of Russia. A law signed by Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, clarified that Russia was laying claim to all four regions it had annexed, illegally, in their entirety – despite the fact Russia does not wholly control any of them and is in retreat. Zaporizhzhia, close to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has been the target of several fatal attacks in the past week. Last week, 30 people died and 88 were injured when a rocket hit the city. Some of the victims were waiting in a queue on the outskirts of the city to enter the occupied territories while others were waiting at a bus stop. In a separate development, at least five people were killed and as many injured after Ukrainian forces struck a bus while shelling a strategically important bridge in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported. Ukraine is continuing to make advances in the east and south of the country, with Russian troops retreating under pressure on both fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced in his nightly address on Thursday that Ukrainian forces had liberated more than 500 sq km of territory in Kherson alone since the start of October. Russian-backed separatist forces however said on Friday they had captured ground in Donetsk, their first claim of new gains, saying they had captured a series of villages near the industrial town of Bakhmut, which has been under Russian shelling for weeks. “On the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic, a grouping of troops of the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, with fire support from Russian forces, liberated Otradovka, Veselaya Dolina and Zaitsevo,” the separatists said on social media. Putin appeared to admit to losses on Wednesday in a televised call with teachers, saying the Kremlin was “working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise”. In a video addressed to Russian troops on Friday, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, urged them to lay down their arms, promising them “life and safety” if they did so. “We guarantee life, security and justice to everyone who refuses to fight immediately,” Reznikov said. “And we will get a tribunal for those who gave criminal orders. You can still save Russia from tragedy, and the Russian army from humiliation.” Reznikov said Russian troops had been “deceived and betrayed” by the Kremlin, citing how Moscow’s soldiers were now paying “with blood for someone’s fantasies and false goals”. Military analysts say Russia is at its weakest point, having lost masses of equipment and fighters, and is unlikely to be able to regain any ground unless its mobilisation proves a success. Russia announced the partial mobilisation of 300,000 men in September after it lost control of half of Ukraine’s north-east Kharkiv province."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/apr/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-pounds-bakhmut-us-and-eu-welcome-chinas-call-with-zelenskiy","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-27T17:50:56Z","webTitle":"Forced deportation of children from Ukraine by Moscow is genocide, Council of Europe says – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-pounds-bakhmut-us-and-eu-welcome-chinas-call-with-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/apr/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-pounds-bakhmut-us-and-eu-welcome-chinas-call-with-zelenskiy","fields":{"headline":"Forced deportation of children from Ukraine by Moscow is genocide, Council of Europe says – as it happened","bodyText":"As the time approaches 9pm in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, here is a round-up of today’s news. Russia said its patience should not be tested over nuclear weapons in another repeat of hardline rhetoric over their use. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that Russia will do “everything to prevent the development of events according to the worst scenario … but not at the cost of infringing on our vital interests”. Vladimir Putin has previously made comments saying he wants to avoid nuclear war, but his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told a UN hearing on Monday that the world was “possibly more dangerous” than during the cold war. The Kremlin said that relations with European countries are at their “lowest possible level” amid more expulsions of diplomats. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it welcomed anything that could hasten the end of the Ukraine conflict when asked about Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders. Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg also welcomed the discussion between president Xi and president Zelenskiy and repeated the possibility of the war ending at the “negotiating table”. Stoltenberg said 98% of promised combat vehicles have now been delivered to Ukraine. This comprises 1,550 armoured vehicles and 230 tanks. This equates to nine new Ukrainian brigades. The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe has voted that the forced detention and deportation of children from Russian occupied territories of Ukraine is “genocide”, at a session on Thursday. A resolution on “deportations and forcible transfers of Ukrainian children and other civilians to Russian Federation or to Ukrainian territories temporarily occupied: create conditions for their safe return, stop these crimes and punish the perpetrators” passed with 87 votes in favour, meaning an overwhelming majority. One representative voted against and another abstained. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that its forces had taken four blocks in north-western, western and south-western Bakhmut, Russia state-owned news agency RIA reported. Russia’s foreign ministry has rejected a bid by the US embassy to visit the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in prison on 11 May. It said the measure was taken in response to Washington’s failure to process visas for “representatives from the journalistic pool” of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to the United Nations on Monday. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has invited Pope Francis to visit Ukraine during a visit to the Vatican. He asked the pontiff for help to return children from the east of Ukraine who have been forcibly taken to Russia by Kremlin forces. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s former ambassador to Berlin – has said Germany was still failing to provide the support it should. “The Germans are helping much more than they were, and for that we Ukrainians are very grateful, but the government is only delivering as much as it feels it should,” he told Die Zeit in an interview in Kyiv. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner, has said he was joking when he said the mercenary group would suspend fire in Bakhmut to allow Ukrainian forces on the other side of the frontline to show the city to visiting US journalists. At least seven civilians were killed and 33 injured between Wednesday and Thursday, Ukraine’s presidential office has said, including one person killed and 23 wounded – including a child – when four Kalibr cruise missiles hit the southern city of Mykolaiv. Russia has reinforced its defences ahead of a much-expected counterattack by Ukrainian forces, analysts have suggested. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the 500 miles (800km) of Russian lines protecting occupied Ukraine have been triple-fortified and included a “gush of manpower”. The timing comes as the usual winter freeze has begun to thaw and dry, making mobilisation more likely. Britain’s opposition Labour party has asked the government why there has been no new weapons announcement since February and no fresh update from ministers to parliament since January. That’s all for today. Thanks for following along. We’ll be back tomorrow. The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe has voted that the forced detention and deportation of children from Russian occupied territories of Ukraine is “genocide”, at a session on Thursday. A resolution on “deportations and forcible transfers of Ukrainian children and other civilians to Russian Federation or to Ukrainian territories temporarily occupied: create conditions for their safe return, stop these crimes and punish the perpetrators” passed with 87 votes in favour, meaning an overwhelming majority. One representative voted against and another abstained. In its resolution, the assembly called for “immediate and urgent action to be taken to halt the practices of unlawful forcible transfer and deportation currently being carried out by the Russian Federation against the Ukrainian population, and especially its policy and practices relating to the removal of children from their families and homes and their subsequent absorption into Russian citizenship, identity and culture.” It added: “The assembly highlights the need for the recording and monitoring of individual cases, both in order to permit mechanisms for rapid redress, and to collect evidence of accountability in order to bring the perpetrators, at all levels of responsibility, to justice.” The assembly called for the practice to stop “immediately and unconditionally”. It also demanded Russia give access to NGOs and charities, as well as information about where the children now are. The international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin in March in relation to the “unlawful deportation” of minors. One was also issued for Russia’s children’s rights commissioner Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova who is believed to have 18 adopted children, including a teenager from Mariupol. The resolution claims that Russia began moving children from the occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk before its invasion on 24 February last year. In a report earlier this month, the Ukrainian government said it had collected reports of more than 19,000 children who had been deported. The Ukrainian security service has given details of eight men of military age who had tried to leave Ukraine to avoid serving in the armed forces. It said that a group was charging up to $7,000 (£5,600) to help people illegally cross the border, including with false documents. Ten have been arrested in total across Ukraine. One was a taxman in the Poltava oblast who sold fake medical certificates, and another in Kharkiv is suspected of helping people evade military service by posing as business travellers for defence firms. Other schemes to smuggle people out include disguising them as truck drivers, the SBU reports. Russia has reinforced its defences ahead of a much-expected counterattack by Ukrainian forces, analysts have suggested. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the 500 miles (800km) of Russian lines protecting occupied Ukraine have been triple-fortified and included a “gush of manpower”. The timing comes as the usual winter freeze has begun to thaw and dry, making mobilisation more likely. The Russian defensive wall runs from Kherson, in Ukraine’s south, to the north-east of the country, spanning more than 500 miles. An autumn counterattack saw Ukrainian forces sweep across the south-east, retaking half of Kherson city. “These defensive lines consist of layered fortifications and trenches,” said Brady Africk at US thinktank American Enterprise Institute. They include anti-tank ditches, raised barriers, lines of pre-fabricated defences known as dragon’s teeth, landmines and trenches for personnel, he told AFP. The Russian objective is “to maintain control over occupied territory and to attempt to limit Ukraine’s ability to conduct a counteroffensive”, he said. Moscow’s strategy is to be able to “absorb any attack”, said Pierre Razoux at the Mediterranean Foundation of Strategic Studies, a French research body. “The attackers are likely to get stuck by the time they reach the second layer, and even if they get past it, the third is going to be very hard to breach,” he said. Russia will employ the time-honoured strategy of channelling attacking enemy troops onto ground of their choosing, said Andrew Galer at British strategy thinktank Janes. But Ukraine meanwhile gets to decide where to attack Russian lines, he said, adding that Kyiv may not have made its choice yet. Ukraine could well try to mislead Russia with a small-scale attack to pull defending forces there, and then direct the main attack elsewhere, he said. Vassily Kashin, at the HSE university in Moscow, said Ukraine could pick the region of Bakhmut where battles have raged for 10 months for its attack, but acknowledged that “the data we have are very limited”. Kashin said the balance of forces at the front is changing in favour of Russia. “Ukraine can try to change this with a last desperate blow,” he said. More from Vladimir Putin’s speech at the launch of a Russian-built nuclear power plant in Turkey on Thursday. Putin praised the leadership of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ahead of an election where Erdoğan is running to be re-elected. Erdoğan, 69, suspended all campaigning for Turkey’s pivotal presidential and parliamentary elections on 14 May after falling ill while conducting a live TV interview on Tuesday. While a member of Nato and sending arms to Ukraine, Turkey has maintained ties to Russia during the war and has hosted discussions between both sides. The Russian president spoke virtually at the launch of a Russian-built nuclear plant in Turkey, using the opportunity to heap praise on Erdoğan, saying Moscow was ready to “extend the hand of friendship”. Putin said the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, Turkey’s first, was a “convincing example of how much you, President Erdoğan, are doing for your country, for the growth of its economy, for all Turkish citizens”. “I want to say it straight: you know how to set ambitious goals and are confidently moving towards their implementation,” he added. Putin stressed that Russia was one of the first countries to send rescue teams and medical personnel to Turkey in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in February. “We are always ready to extend the hand of friendship to our Turkish partners,” Putin added. Here’s a selection of photographs from the conflict in Ukraine on Thursday. The Ukrainian clamour for US-made F-16 jets has continued, with the country’s foreign minister and home office adviser tweeting on the subject earlier on Thursday. Dmytro Kuleba and Anton Gerashchenko said that F-16s would deter Russia rather than provoke it, and it would help ensure “protection of Europe”. Russia has destroyed a bridge in Chernihiv, according to the north-eastern oblast’s governor. Viacheslav Chaus told a telethon that Russian shelling had destroyed the crossing over the Sudost River. It connected the villages of Muravyi and Gremyach near Novgorod-Siversky. Serhii Serhienko, the head of the Novgorod-Siversky district military administration said: “For several weeks, the bridges over the rivers of the Novgorod-Siversk community have been shelled. This makes it impossible to provide services to the population in a normal format: to provide food and other things. And it limits movement to the central self-government bodies.” A former commander of Russia’s Wagner group who is seeking asylum in Norway has been convicted of carrying an air gun and being involved in a bar fight. Andrei Medvedev was given a two-week sentence which has been suspended for two years. He was acquitted of violence against the police, Reuters reports. “I want to thank the court for a fair ruling,” Medvedev told Reuters, adding he was looking to the future. “I am studying Norwegian and I hope I will get asylum.” He crossed the Russian-Norwegian border in January and has spoken out about his time fighting in Ukraine. On Tuesday, he pleaded guilty to fighting outside an Oslo bar in February and preventing a police officer from doing his or her duty. He also pleaded guilty to carrying an air gun in public on a separate occasion on 14 March. But Medvedev had pleaded not guilty to a fourth charge of committing violence against a police officer. He was acquitted on Thursday. Separately, Medvedev will continue to speak with Norwegian police about his time with Wagner. Russia denies accusations of war crimes in the conflict. “Now he can avoid jail and focus on what he came [to Norway] for: explain [about his time] in the war in Ukraine,” his lawyer, Brynjulf Risnes, told Reuters. At least seven civilians were killed and 33 injured between Wednesday and Thursday, Ukraine’s presidential office has said, including one person killed and 23 wounded – including a child – when four Kalibr cruise missiles hit the southern city of Mykolaiv (see 05.49). The governor of Mykolaiv province, Vitalii Kim, said 22 multi-storey buildings, 12 private houses and other residential buildings were damaged in the attack, Associated Press reports. Defence officials said the Kalibr missiles were fired from somewhere in the Black Sea. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner, has said he was joking when he said the mercenary group would suspend fire in Bakhmut to allow Ukrainian forces on the other side of the frontline to show the city to visiting US journalists. Prigozhin said in an audio message on Thursday: “A decision has been taken to suspend artillery fire so that American journalists can safely film Bakhmut and go home.” In a later audio message, however, he said: “Guys, this is military humour. Humour, and nothing more ... It was a joke,” Reuters reported. Wagner has been leading Russia’s assault on Bakhmut since the summer in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, but Ukrainian forces have so far thwarted its attempts to take full control of the city. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s former ambassador to Berlin – who was deeply critical of what he saw as Germany’s hesitancy over providing material support to Ukraine from the start of Russia’s invasion – has said Germany was still failing to provide the support it should. “The Germans are helping much more than they were, and for that we Ukrainians are very grateful, but the government is only delivering as much as it feels it should,” he told Die Zeit in an interview in Kyiv. Melnyk, who returned to Ukraine in October as deputy foreign minister, was perceived as something of a thorn in the side of the government of Olaf Scholz for his frequent interventions in debates on Ukraine, which he himself describes as “often undiplomatic”. He said he regretted he was no longer able to use his influence on Berlin. “A year ago we were powerful participants in the debate, and even steering it. But my successor does it differently,” he said. “Now we’re simply swimming with the current, letting ourselves go with the flow.... Our offensive is going to happen, and the Germans think: ‘We’ve delivered 18 Leopards (tanks), ticked that off the list, finito’. As if the war had been won with these tanks. The coalition government has … convinced the German public that regarding military help, everything is sorted. Which is not true.” Instead of “continuing to bang the drum”, his successor, Oleksiy Makeev, was “repeating mantra-like, ‘Thankyou Germany’,” Melnyk said, adding that he was “hardly” in touch with Makeev, due to their “very different points of view”. He denied his return to Ukraine – where his particular responsibility is relations with Latin America - was an attempt to rein him in. “My post there was long enough and it was a miracle that I was able to stay there when the war started,” he said. But he admitted he had not wanted to leave. “It is no secret that I left Berlin against my will. I would have liked to have continued, because I had the feeling that I could have achieved a lot more for Ukraine … despite the strong headwinds I faced. “Here in Kjiv the opposition was stronger still, because many didn’t understand why I was often acting in this very unconventional, often undiplomatic way in order to pull the government out of its lethargy.” Here’s some analysis of President Xi and President Zelenskiy’s call on Wednesday by our correspondent Helen Davidson in Taipei, and why it may have been hastened by problematic comments about sovereignty by a Chinese ambassador. A long-awaited phone call between Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been cautiously welcomed, but China analysts say the timing suggests it could be partly an act of damage control after controversial comments by China’s ambassador to France. Ambassador Lu Shaye, one of China’s “wolf warrior” diplomats with a history of fiery remarks, caused outrage across Europe this week when he denied the sovereignty of former Soviet states, saying they “did not have effective status”. The comments were roundly condemned, with several European nations summoning Chinese envoys for rebuke, and politicians suggesting it demonstrated China’s untrustworthiness as a neutral party in the Ukraine war. Beijing, which counts Russia as its closest major ally, has sought to present itself as neutral and a potential peacemaker and there have been signs that Xi was unhappy with Russia’s actions, but in practice China has largely supported Russia’s stance. “At a time when there is already significant concern about Russian ambitions and PRC [People’s Republic of China] support for them, Lu’s comments seemed to suggest that Beijing is open to continued, perhaps even expanded, Russian aggression,” said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.

It said the measure was taken in response to Washington’s failure to process visas for “representatives from the journalistic pool” of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to the United Nations on Monday. Lavrov led a session of the UN security council on multilateralism, in which he said the world was at its most dangerous since the cold war. He had requested to bring journalists with him from Russia, but they were barred from entering the US. “It was particularly emphasised [to the US diplomat] that such sabotage, intended to prevent normal journalistic work, would not go unanswered,” the foreign ministry said in its statement. Gerschkovich has previously been visited by Lynne Tracy, the US ambassador to Russia. The visit would have taken place on 11 May. The Kremlin has said it is considering other retaliatory measures against the US over the rejection of visas. He was arrested last month in the city of Ekaterinburg by Russia. The 31-year-old has been charged with espionage, which he has denied, and appeared in court on Tuesday. The US has designated him as wrongfully detained by Russia. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has invited Pope Francis to visit Ukraine during a visit to the Vatican. He asked the pontiff for help to return children from the east of Ukraine who have been forcibly taken to Russia by Kremlin forces. “I invited His Holiness to visit Ukraine in person,” Shmyhal told reporters at the Foreign Press Association in Rome a few hours after the papal audience. He said he had discussed with the 86-year-old pope the peace plan proposed by Volodymyr Zelenskiy to end the war sparked by Russia’s invasion last year. This included “discussing in a little more detail the different steps the Vatican could take” to help Kyiv achieve its goals, the prime minister said, speaking through an Italian translator. “For example, I asked for the participation, the assistance from the Vatican, from His Holiness, for the return to Ukraine of children, some of whom were orphaned, who were taken away by force, mainly to Russia.” More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the February 2022 invasion, according to Kyiv, with many allegedly placed in institutions and foster homes. Russia denies the allegations, saying instead it has saved Ukrainian children from the horrors of the war. In March, the international criminal court announced an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war crime accusation of unlawfully deporting Ukrainian children. The pope has repeatedly called for peace in Ukraine, although the Vatican’s attempts to mediate in the conflict have yet to yield any results. Shmyhal was in Rome on Wednesday for a conference on how Italian businesses could help with the reconstruction of Ukraine, when he also met with Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni. Russia is not planning to take the path of nuclear escalation in its standoff with the west over Ukraine but others should not test its patience, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. Her comments follow a flurry of warnings by senior Russian officials, including president Vladimir Putin, that western military support for Ukraine is increasing the risks of a catastrophic nuclear conflict. “We will do everything to prevent the development of events according to the worst scenario, but not at the cost of infringing on our vital interests,” Zakharova told a regular news conference according to Reuters. “I do not recommend that anybody doubt our determination and put it to the test in practice,” she added. Russia has strongly criticised the supply of western arms to Ukraine and the expansion of the Nato military alliance closer to its borders. Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, this month became the 31st member of Nato, while Ukraine itself also wishes to join, though it faces opposition from some countries. “They [the US] continue to deliberately infringe on our fundamental interests, deliberately generate risks and raise the stakes in the confrontation with Russia …,” said Zakharova. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, a close Putin ally, said earlier this week that the world was “quite probably on the verge of a new world war”. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that its forces had taken four blocks in north-western, western and south-western Bakhmut, Russia state-owned news agency RIA reported. Reuters could not independently confirm the claim. Russian forces have been struggling for months to capture the city in eastern Ukraine. In the news conference Stoltenberg also welcomed the telephone conversation between Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Chinese president Xi Jinping on Wednesday– their first since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Beijing says it is neutral in the conflict and Xi has never condemned the Russian invasion. It has been thought he is trying to maximise potential political benefits from the conflict. The Chinese leader, who made a friendly visit to Moscow last month, has come under increased pressure from western nations to step in and mediate. He said he will send a peace delegation to Kyiv. “Maybe this war will end at the negotiating table,” Stoltenberg said. But he stressed that “it is for Ukraine to decide what are the conditions for talks and what format any talks should have”. In any case, Stoltenberg said, “any possibility for meaningful negotiations requires that Ukraine has the necessary military strength to send a very clear message to President Putin that he will not win on the battlefield”. Following earlier comments by Nato’s Jens Stoltenberg that nearly all promised combat vehicles have been delivered to Ukraine, Agence France-Presse (AFP) has details on how much has been sent. In a news conference, Stoltenberg said the total was made up of 1,550 armoured vehicles and 230 tanks. This equates to nine new Ukrainian brigades. “This will put Ukraine in a strong position to continue to retake occupied territory,” the secretary general said. Nato members have provided anti-aircraft systems and artillery while Poland and the Czech Republic have given Soviet-built MiG-29 aircraft. Training has also been given to thousands of Ukrainian soldiers. Stoltenberg emphasised this “unprecedented military support to Ukraine” but cautioned that “we should never underestimate Russia”. Moscow was mobilising more ground forces and was “willing to send in thousands of troops with very high casualty rates,” he said, adding that Nato members need to “stay the course”. Stoltenberg said that a Nato summit in July in Lithuania would set out plans for a “multi-year programme of support” for Ukraine. The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group said on Thursday it was suspending artillery fire in Bakhmut to allow Ukrainian forces on the other side of the frontline to safely show the city to visiting US journalists. Wagner has been leading Russia’s assault on Bakhmut in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, but Ukrainian forces have so far thwarted its attempts to take full control of the city. Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner’s founder, said in an audio message published by his press service: “A decision has been taken to suspend artillery fire so that American journalists can safely film Bakhmut and go home.” Prigozhin in the same message warned the Ukrainian side not to try to bring in any extra forces under cover of the journalists’ visit. Reuters could not immediately independently verify whether Wagner had suspended its artillery fire or not. A day earlier, Prigozhin lambasted the defence ministry for not sending much-needed shipments of ammunition to his fighters. The EU is expected to agree to keep its markets open to tariff-free Ukrainian grain for another year on Friday, despite objections from central and eastern European countries hit by declining agricultural prices. A proposal to extend tariff-free access for Ukrainian grain into mid-2024 is expected to be approved by a majority of EU member states, overriding opposition from Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, according to a diplomatic source. MEPs on the European parliament’s international trade committee on Thursday voted to keep in place the suspension of import duties on Ukraine’s agricultural products for another year, paving the way for an agreement with EU member states. The EU dropped tariff barriers on Ukrainian farm produce following the Russian invasion and is now seeking to extend the policy, which expires on 5 June. But logistical bottlenecks have meant much of the grain has stayed in the EU, depressing prices and farm incomes in neighbouring countries. The European Commission last week proposed €100m in compensation payments for farmers in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, after three of those countries banned the import of grain and other food products. These countries will also be allowed to ban the sale of Ukrainian grain inside their borders, although foodstuffs can continue to travel onwards to other EU states and countries around the world. EU officials argue that Ukraine’s continuing grain exports are helping keep the country afloat at a time when the government in Kyiv risks running out of money. One senior EU official contrasted the €26bn Ukrainian businesses earned over the past 12 months from exports including grain, with the €18bn the EU intends to lend Kyiv this year to keep Ukraine’s public sector functioning. “If we didn’t have this €26[bn], [EU aid] would be even higher.” As the time approaches 2pm in Kyiv, here is a roundup of developments in the ongoing conflict. Relations with European countries are at their “lowest possible level”, the Kremlin has said, adding that each wave of expulsions of Russian diplomats was reducing the space for diplomacy. Germany is one of the latest country to send diplomats home, expelling 20 on Saturday. Russia responded by expelling 40. Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated that the Kremlin welcomed the call between China and Ukraine on Wednesday, adding: “We are ready to welcome anything that could hasten the end of the conflict in Ukraine and Russia achieving all the goals it has set itself.” Nato allies have delivered almost all their promised combat vehicles to Ukraine, the transatlantic defence alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. “More than 98% of the combat vehicles promised to Ukraine have been delivered,” Stoltenberg said at a news briefing, adding that Kyiv “now has the military capabilities it needs to recapture territory”. EU diplomats are still seeking to convince central and eastern European countries to extend Ukraine’s tariff-free access to the EU market for another year. The EU dropped tariff barriers on Ukrainian grain after the Russian invasion last year and is now seeking to extend the policy, which expires on 5 June. But logistical bottlenecks have meant much of the grain has stayed in the EU, depressing prices and farm incomes in neighbouring countries. A Russian missile strike hit apartment buildings in the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv overnight and has killed one person and injured 23 more. The remains of an “unidentified aerial military object” have been found in northern Poland near the city of Bydgoszcz, Poland’s defence ministry and justice minister have said. The broadcaster RFM FM said the object, found near the city of Bydgoszcz, was an air-to-surface missile measuring several metres, with its head missing. Russian forces pounded the city of Bakhmut, the months-old focal point of their attempts to capture the eastern Ukrainian industrial region of Donbas, and the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force said Ukrainian troops were pouring in ahead of an “inevitable” counter-offensive. Britain’s opposition Labour party has asked the government why there has been no new weapons announcement since February and no fresh update from ministers to parliament since January. In an urgent question to the defence minister Andrew Murrison, the shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said: “I am concerned momentum behind our military help is faltering, and our UK commitment to Ukraine is flagging. “No statement on Ukraine from the defence secretary since January. No new weapons announced for Ukraine since February. No 2023 Action Plan for Ukraine, despite being promised last August. No priorities set for the London Ukraine recovery conference in June,” he told MPs. “The prime minister said in February the UK ‘will be the first country to provide Ukraine with longer-range weapons’. What? And when? The defence secretary said on Friday that ‘delivery is accelerating’ of military aid. How? And what?” The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was not present to give a response, but Murrison, one of his deputies, said the UK was “one of the leading providers of military support for Ukraine”. A total of 14,000 Ukrainian troops had been trained by the UK so far, and the total was expected to reach 20,000 this year, he added. Vladimir Putin will speak to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, later on Thursday, the Kremlin has said, before the two countries mark the inauguration of Turkey’s first nuclear power reactor, built by Russia. The Akkuyu nuclear power plant in Turkey’s southern Mersin province has been built by Russia’s state nuclear energy company Rosatom. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a regular news briefing that after their telephone conversation the two presidents would take part – virtually – in a ceremony marking the loading of nuclear fuel into the first power unit at Akkuyu. The $20bn, 4,800-megawatt project to build four reactors will allow Turkey to join the small club of nations with civil nuclear energy. Asked about alleged health problems that Erdoğan is having, Peskov said Moscow knew nothing of the issue. Turkey faces landmark presidential and parliamentary elections on 14 May. But Erdoğan cancelled his campaign rallies scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday for health reasons. While a member of Nato and sending arms to Ukraine, Turkey has maintained ties to Russia during the war and has hosted discussions between both sides. Relations with European countries are at their “lowest possible level”, the Kremlin has said, adding that each wave of expulsions of Russian diplomats was reducing the space for diplomacy. Countries including Moldova, Sweden and Norway have all expelled Russian diplomats in recent days. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said all such measures would be responded to in kind. The Kremlin said it welcomed anything that could bring the end of the Ukraine conflict closer when asked about Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders, Reuters reports. The call between Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelenskiy had long been sought by Kyiv. Moscow added that still needed to achieve the aims of what it continues to call its “special military operation” in Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was familiar with the details of what the two leaders had discussed and said their stances on the conflict were well known, according to Reuters. “We are ready to welcome anything that could hasten the end of the conflict in Ukraine and Russia achieving all the goals it has set itself,” Peskov said. “As for the fact that they communicated – that is a sovereign matter for each of these countries and a question of their bilateral dialogue.” Nato allies have delivered almost all their promised combat vehicles to Ukraine, the transatlantic defence alliance’s general secretary, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. “More than 98% of the combat vehicles promised to Ukraine have been delivered,” Stoltenberg said at a news briefing, adding that Kyiv “now has the military capabilities it needs to recapture territory”. He also welcomed Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, their first since Russia invaded Ukraine, but said it “doesn’t change the fact that China has still not condemned” the Russian invasion. Jack Teixeira, the US Air National Guardsman accused of leaking military secrets and keeping an arsenal of weapons in his bedroom, appears in court for a detention hearing today (see 06.29). Reuters reports that federal prosecutors are expected to argue that Texeira, who was arrested on 13 April in Massachusetts and charged with violating the Espionage Act, should remain in custody as a national security risk. The 21-year-old is alleged to have leaked classified documents, including some relating to troop movements in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, to gamers on the messaging app Discord. He kept a gun locker two feet from his bed containing handguns, bolt-action rifles and a military-style rifle. FBI agents also found a gas mask, ammunition and what appeared to be a silencer in his desk drawer. “The defendant undoubtedly poses a danger to the US at large based on his ability to cause exceptionally grave danger to the US national security,” a motion filed by the office of US attorney Rachael Rollins said. “There is also evidence to suggest that the defendant may also pose a physical danger to the community.” The remains of an “unidentified military object” found in a forest in northern Poland (see 08.03) could be part of a missile stuck in the ground, Polish broadcster RMF FM has said. Reuters cites RFM as saying the object, found near the city of Bydgoszcz, was an air-to-surface missile measuring several metres, with its head missing. No sources were named. Poland has been on alert for possible spillover of weaponry from the war in Ukraine after two people were killed last November by what Warsaw said was a misfired Ukrainian air defence missile. The analyst Ulrich Speck has an interesting thread on what may lie behind Wednesday’s phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy (see 05.30), their first since Russia invaded Ukraine. For Xi, who said China would send special representatives to Ukraine and hold talks with all parties seeking peace, “the war in Ukraine is first and foremost an opportunity to advance his geopolitical agenda”, Speck argues. The Chinese leader aims to weaken Russia (though not too much), split Europe from the US by playing nice to the EU, and similarly weaken the US by isolating it from Europe, he says. “Making peace in Ukraine or defending its sovereignty is nowhere on the list,” Speck concludes. “It’s debatable whether Chinese interests as defined by Xi are helped more by an ongoing and even escalating war in Ukraine or by a ceasefire.” The Twitter thread begins here: EU diplomats are still seeking to convince central and eastern European countries to extend Ukraine’s tariff-free access to the EU market for another year, reports Politico. The EU dropped tariff barriers on Ukrainian grain following the Russian invasion last year and is now seeking to extend the policy, which expires on 5 June. But logistical bottlenecks have meant much of the grain has stayed in the EU, depressing prices and farm incomes in neighbouring countries. The European Commission last week proposed €100m in compensation payments for farmers in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, after three of those countries banned the impact of grain and other food products. These countries will also be allowed to ban the sale of Ukrainian grain inside their borders, although food can continue to travel onwards to other EU states and countries around the world. Officials hoped this emergency help for central and eastern Europe would ease the decision on extending Ukraine’s duty-free access for one year, but a deal is yet to be reached. Officials are still hopeful of finding a deal, with diplomats due to vote on the plans on Friday. A jailed former presidential hopeful in Belarus, which has been hit with western sanctions for allowing Russian troops to launch their invasion of Ukraine from its territory, has been transferred to hospital from prison, AFP reports. Viktor Babariko, 59, a high-profile candidate who wanted to challenge President Alexander Lukashenko in 2020 elections, is undergoing surgery in a hospital in Novopolotsk, authorities confirmed. Babariko was jailed in 2021 on charges of bribery and tax evasion and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Belarus has jailed or forced into exile all the leading political figures who contested Lukashenko’s re-election. A reminder that Alessio Mamo, one of several freelance photographers who have worked extensively with the Guardian in Ukraine since the start of the war, last night won the photojournalism category in Amnesty International’s media awards. Alessio won for this remarkable piece, with Guardian reporters Lorenzo Tondo, Emma Graham-Harrison and Isobel Koshiw, documenting the scale of the violence that has been integral to Russia’s campaign. A Russian missile strike hit apartment buildings in the Ukrainian town of Mykolaiv overnight, authorities have said (see 05.49), injuring 23 people. Here are some agency pictures of the aftermath of the strike that have just come through. The remains of an “unidentified aerial military object” have been found in northern Poland near the city of Bydgoszcz, Poland’s defence ministry and justice minister have said. Reuters reported that it was not immediately clear what the object was, where it came from, or how long it had been there. The justice minister said it was found in a forest. “The situation does not threaten the safety of residents. The location of the discovery is being investigated” by Polish officers and military police, the interior ministry said. The Globsec thinktank has published a report – you can read it here – on the “complex, costly and almost impossibly challenging” task Ukraine will eventually face in demining its territory and clearing it of deadly ordnance and explosives. About 30% of Ukraine’s territory (174,000 sq km) will require survey and clearance of vast amounts of ordnance, it says, making the country “the largest mined territory in the world, surpassing such former frontrunners as Afghanistan and Syria”. Much of the area affected is of course difficult or impossible to assess since fighting is still ongoing: around 18% of Ukraine’s territory remains under occupation. Russian troops are also “infamously creative in leaving mine-traps”, the report says, planting “victim-activated devices on animals and dead bodies, as well as double and even triple booby-traps on roads, fields and forests”. And it says the pace of demining work is cripplingly slow, with operations in areas controlled by Ukraine in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions between 2015 and 2021 succeeding in clearing only about 6% of potentially contaminated territory . That represents about 64 sq km a year, with most of the work done by the special services of Ukraine’s defence and interior ministries supported by international NGOs such as the HALO Trust. Reuters has taken a hard look at satellite imagery of Russia’s “vast network of fortifications, sweeping down from western Russia through eastern Ukraine and on to Crimea” and built in readiness for Ukraine’s expected counteroffensive. The news agency says it has examined thousands of defensive positions, both inside Russia and along Ukrainian front lines, and concluded Russia is most heavily defended in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and the gateway to the Crimean Peninsula. Military experts have told Reuters the extensive, layered defences, most built since Ukraine’s advance last November, could make things harder for Kyiv this time and that progress would hinge on Ukrainian forces’ ability to carry out complex, combined operations effectively. Neil Melvin of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said: It’s not the numbers for the Ukrainians. It’s can they do this kind of warfare, combined arms operations? The Russians have shown they can’t do it and they’ve gone back to their old Soviet method of attrition. Analysts have said a Ukrainian counteroffensive could change the dynamics of the war, which has become a bloody battle of attrition, and believe the sheer length of the front could leave Russia’s defences severely exposed. But they warn that Ukraine is unlikely to receive any more armoured weaponry from the west for some time, meaning Kyiv is under pressure to retake as much land as possible in case military support begins to wane. Melvin added: We’ve cleaned out most of the stocks in the West. It’s going to take some years to rebuild. I think this is Ukraine’s big opportunity to press on. Hello, this is Jon Henley taking over from Helen Sullivan. I’ll be bringing you the latest news from – and related to – Ukraine as it happens, for the rest of the European morning. That’s it from me for now. My colleague Jon Henley will take you through the rest of the day’s news from Ukraine. Zelenskiy has posted a video showing the damage caused by a Russian strike on Mykolaiv overnight – the number of wounded has now risen to 23, including a child, he says. Zelenskiy wrote: The country-invader never ceases to prove that the main goal of this war is terror and the destruction of Ukrainians and everything Ukrainian. At night, Russia shelled Mykolaiv with four Kalibr missiles launched from the Black Sea. High-precision weapons were aimed at private houses, a historic building and a high-rise building. At the moment, it is known about 1 killed and 23 wounded, including a child. Eternal memory to the deceased and speedy recovery to the wounded. Federal prosecutors are urging a judge to keep behind bars a Massachusetts Air National guardsman accused of leaking highly classified military documents, arguing he may still have access to secret national defence information that he could expose, the Associated Press reports. In court papers filed late Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers said releasing 21-year-old Jack Teixeira from jail while he awaits trial would be a grave threat to US national security. Investigators are still trying to determine whether he kept any physical or digital copies of classified information, including files that haven’t already surfaced publicly, they wrote. “There simply is no condition or combination of conditions that can ensure the Defendant will not further disclose additional information still in his knowledge or possession,” prosecutors wrote. “The damage the Defendant has already caused to the US national security is immense. The damage the Defendant is still capable of causing is extraordinary.” The documents Teixeira is accused of leaking provided a wide variety of highly classified information on allies and adversaries, with details including Ukraine’s air defences: Brussels also welcomed the conversation Xi and Zelenskiy, thought to be their first call since Russia invaded Ukraine. “It is an important, long overdue first step by China in exercising its responsibilities as a member of the UN security council,” said European Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer. “China’s leadership needs to use its influence to bring Russia to end its war of aggression, restore Ukraine’s territorial integrity and respect its sovereignty, as a basis for a just peace.” The White House has welcomed Wednesday’s phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy but said it was too soon to tell whether it would lead to a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. John Kirby, White House national security spokesperson, told reporters that the call was a “good thing,” but regarding whether it would lead to a meaningful move toward peace, “I don’t think we know that yet.” The governor of the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv said Russian missiles had also hit an apartment building and a private house in the city of the same name. One person was killed and 15 were injured, Vitaliy Kim wrote on the Telegram messaging app. The Guardian was not able to verify battlefield reports. Russian forces pounded the city of Bakhmut, the months-old focal point of their attempts to capture the eastern Ukrainian industrial region of Donbas, and the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force said Ukrainian troops were pouring in ahead of an “inevitable” counter-offensive. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces, in a report on Facebook, said fighting gripped Bakhmut and nearby areas. It said Russian forces had failed to advance on two villages to the north-west. At least a dozen localities came under Russian fire. Separately, Serhiy Cherevatiy, spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern group of forces, told national television on Wednesday that in the past 24 hours, Russian forces had attacked 324 times using artillery and multiple rocket launchers. “The Russians are destroying buildings in Bakhmut to prevent our soldiers from using them as fortifications,” Cherevatiy said. Cherevatiy on Tuesday said there had been a record number of attacks on a section of the front farther north – near the city of Kupiansk, in northeastern Ukraine. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest news as it happens. Our top story this morning: Russian forces are pounding the city of Bakhmut in Ukraine’s east. Serhiy Cherevatiy, spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern group of forces, told national television on Wednesday that in the past 24 hours, Russian forces had attacked Ukraine’s east and northeast 324 times using artillery and multiple rocket launchers. “The Russians are destroying buildings in Bakhmut to prevent our soldiers from using them as fortifications,” Cherevatiy said. Cherevatiy on Tuesday said there had been a record number of attacks on a section of the front farther north, near the city of Kupiansk, in northeastern Ukraine. And both the US and European Union have welcomed news of a call between Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, with the EU calling the call, the first between the two leaders since the war began, “an important, long overdue first step by China in exercising its responsibilities as a member of the UN security council”. Here are the other key recent developments: China’s president, Xi Jinping, spoke to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Wednesday for the first time since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv had publicly sought such talks for months. Zelenskiy described the hour’s phone call as “long and meaningful”. Xi told Zelenskiy that China would send special representatives to Ukraine and hold talks with all parties seeking peace, Chinese state media reported. The White House welcomed the phone call, but said it was too soon to tell whether it would lead to a peace deal. Russia’s envoy to the UN in Geneva said no real progress had been achieved in resolving issues raised by Moscow over the Black Sea grain deal, which is due to expire next month. British fighter jets helped in a joint Nato response to intercept three Russian planes, including two SU-27 fighter jets, over the Baltic Sea on Wednesday. The head of Russia’s private Wagner militia said Ukraine was preparing for an “inevitable” counter-offensive and was sending well-prepared units to the devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, for many months the focal point of fighting. The Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny says he is being investigated on terrorism charges that could see him sentenced to 30 years in prison, Reuters has reported. The Kremlin critic is serving sentences totalling 11 and a half years on charges including fraud and contempt of court, which human rights groups say were made up to silence him. Italy has said it wants to play a major role in the reconstruction of Ukraine and urged EU bodies to back the rebuilding. Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, met the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, on Wednesday. A Ukrainian reporter working as a fixer for Italy’s daily newspaper Repubblica was shot dead by snipers in Kherson, while his Italian colleague was wounded, the newspaper said. “Our correspondent Corrado Zunino and his fixer Bogdan Bitik were victims of an ambush by Russian snipers today on the outskirts of Kherson, in southern Ukraine.” Russia is resettling poor citizens from its remote regions in the occupied east of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s deputy defence minister. Hanna Mailar said the inward migration to Ukraine was mainly being seen in Luhansk. In a press conference, the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said there was “no use now in saying who is right” in the conflict. In a joint conference with the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, Lula said that “no one can doubt that Brazilians condemn Russia’s [invasion]. The mistake happened and the war started.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T09:58:46Z","webTitle":"Impact of war on Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – visual guide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","fields":{"headline":"Impact of war on Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – visual guide","bodyText":"Where is the plant and how significant is it? The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe and ninth largest in the world. It sits on the eastern bank of the Dnieper River, about 550km (340 miles) south-east of Kyiv. It was built between 1984 and 1995, and modernised over the last two decades with the help of European Union funds released in the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. That programme meant to finish this year, but was disrupted by the Russian invasion. The plant has six nuclear reactors, and when all of them are online it can produce 5.7 GW, enough to power roughly 4 million Ukrainian homes. Two are operating at the moment but it is still a vital part of Ukraine’s electric grid. It has been in the news because of safety concerns after Russia troops took control of the area, stationed military vehicles inside turbine halls, and drew up a risky plan to disconnect it from Ukraine’s grid. What has happened at the plant since the outbreak of war? The Russian military took over the area in the early days of the war, although the plant is still run by Ukrainian workers. Here are some key dates since the outbreak of war. 24 February: Russia invades Ukraine, two of six reactors shutdown. 27 February: Fighting first reported in vicinity of the plant. 4 March: Russia seizes the plant after a battle during which a fire breaks out in a training area. Footage of the battle is captured on a security camera: There is global alarm at the prospect of fighting so close to nuclear reactors. Another reactor is shut down. Footage published the next day shows some of the damage: A photograph published on 17 March showed damage to an administrative building at the site: 5 July: Report that Russia has deployed military equipment to the plant, turning it into a base. Footage of Russian vehicles and personnel at the plant emerges in the weeks that follow: 5 August: One of three remaining reactors online is shut down after shelling. 6 August: Alarm over strikes near storage area for radioactive materials. 24 August: Ukraine’s nuclear chief says Russia has a plan to disconnect the plant from the grid, and has filled the turbine halls of two reactors that are still operational with military vehicles: 25 August: The plant is temporarily disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid for first time in nearly 40 years of operation, after final power line connecting the plant to the grid is cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plan. How has war affected the plant and its workers? About 9,000 of a 11,000-strong workforce have chosen to stay on to keep the reactors operating safely, despite extremely difficult working conditions, including mass detentions and assaults. One worker was beaten to death, another so badly assaulted he spent three months in hospital and about 200 workers have been detained, Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, told the Guardian. They have chosen to stay on because without them the risks of some kind of accident that would affect not just the local area or Ukraine, but possibly many neighbouring countries, would be much higher. Although the plant was originally built to Soviet designs, updates to the system means Russian engineers do not know how to run it safely, Kotin said. What might happen next? Ukraine has warned that Russia is contemplating disconnecting the plant from Ukraine’s national grid and connecting it to Russia’s power network. This would be extremely dangerous, because the plant’s cooling systems rely on electricity to work, and if back up diesel generators fail the reactors could only operate safely for 90 minutes. This may be the biggest danger, but Kotin warned that Russia’s management of the site is reckless. Military trucks block access to the turbine halls next to reactors, so if a blaze broke out firefighters might struggle to tackle it. And even if Russia does not attempt a switch, three out of four main power lines to the site are down, along with two out of three backups. On Thursday, the last remaining power line was disrupted twice, leading the plant to be cut off from the national grid for the first time since reactors began operation nearly 40 years ago. All sides have called for a delegation from the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to visit and inspect the site. Kotin said that could happen within one to two weeks, with all sides hammering out practical details. World leaders have urged Russia not to attempt the switch between grids, and called on Moscow to remove military equipment and personnel from the site."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/06/ukraine-residential-areas-in-zaporizhzhia-hit-as-russia-targets-cities","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-06T11:00:43Z","webTitle":"Residential areas in Zaporizhzhia hit as Russia targets cities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/06/ukraine-residential-areas-in-zaporizhzhia-hit-as-russia-targets-cities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/06/ukraine-residential-areas-in-zaporizhzhia-hit-as-russia-targets-cities","fields":{"headline":"Residential areas in Zaporizhzhia hit as Russia targets cities","bodyText":"Seven rockets were fired into residential buildings in Zaporizhzhia before dawn on Thursday, killing at least three people, as Russia increased its attacks on Ukrainian-held cities amid losses by its troops on the battlefield. The strike flattened an apartment building, and videos published by the Zaporizhzhia regional administration showed rescue workers at the scene, with some people still believed to be under the rubble. The city’s mayor, Anatoliy Kuratyev, said 21 people had been saved, including a three-year-old boy. Further explosions in the city were reported mid-morning local time. Kuratyev said Russia had hit an “infrastructure object”, without specifying the nature of the target. Thursday’s attacks came a day after Russia said it considered the whole of Zaprorizhzhia region, including Zaporizhzhia city, part of Russia though it does not occupy it. A law signed by Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday clarified that Russia was laying claim to all four regions it had illegally annexed in their entirety – despite the fact Russia does not wholly control any of them and is in retreat. Upon announcing its intent to annex the areas, Russia’s leadership threatened to use nuclear weapons to respond to attacks on what it now considers its territory. Ukraine described it as “nuclear blackmail” and said it would not be deterred from continuing with its offensives. Zaporizhzhia, close to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has suffered several fatal attacks in the past week. On Friday, 30 people died and 88 were injured when a rocket hit the city. The victims were waiting in a queue on the outskirts of the city to enter the occupied territories and others were waiting at a bus stop. Five other Ukrainian cities were hit on Thursday, in addition to civilian areas in the Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk regions close to the fighting. Russia launched two rockets at the central Ukrainian city of Khmelnytskyi, but both reportedly missed their targets. Elsewhere, Russia used what the Ukrainian authorities say were Iranian-supplied “kamikaze” drones to target the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odesa. Ukraine’s military said they managed to shoot down 18 additional drones before they reached Odesa and Mykolaiv. The Iranian drones are able to remain airborne for several hours and circle over potential targets, before being flown into enemy troops, armour or buildings and exploding on impact. Despite Ukraine’s authorities insisting civilians evacuate frontline areas, people are still living along the contact line; a mixture of elderly people as well as those who say they cannot afford to restart elsewhere. The deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said 14 of the 20 civilians killed in the last 24 hours were living in Ukrainian-controlled areas of Donetsk region. Ukraine has continued to advance in the east and south, and Russian troops have been retreating under pressure on both fronts. In his nightly address on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine had retaken a further three villages as it pushed forward in the southern region of Kherson. Putin appeared to admit to severe losses on Wednesday in a televised call with teachers, saying the Kremlin was “working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise”. Military analysts say Russia is at its weakest point, having lost masses of equipment and men, and is unlikely to be able to regain any ground unless its mobilisation proves a success. Russia announced the partial mobilisation of 300,000 men in September after the collapse of their control of half of Ukraine’s north-east Kharkiv region. Russia’s retreats have prompted unusual criticism of its strategy from some of its top propagandists. Though they blame the Russian military leadership, instead of Putin, it is nevertheless reflective of how these losses have hurt Russia’s strongman narrative. “What have you been doing in this time?” asked Vladimir Solovyov on his talk show on Thursday. “Please explain to me what the general staff’s genius idea is now.” Part of the justification put forward by Solovyov was that Russia was fighting Nato-controlled mercenaries in Ukraine. “The Ukrainian army ceased to exist a long time ago,” he said. The British Ministry of Defence on Thursday said Russia was facing a dilemma in Kherson, the only region where forces have managed to acquire a regional centre since February: Kherson city. “Russia faces a dilemma: withdrawal of combat forces across the [Dneiper River] makes defence of the rest of Kherson oblast more tenable; but the political imperative will be to remain and defend,” read the ministry’s statement. Russian-installed officials in Kherson region have announced that children living in the occupied area will be sent to Crimea, the southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, for two weeks for an autumn camp because of the security situation. The announcement said that “educational events, exciting trips and meetings with interesting people” awaited the children. While this may be an attempt by the Russian authorities to shield the children from the rapidly moving frontlines, it follows a pattern of Russia seeking to immerse Ukrainian children living in the occupied areas in their propaganda narratives. Russia has also taken Ukrainian orphans in the occupied areas to Russia, which Ukraine’s authorities have described as kidnapping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-updates-anti-mobilisation-protests-in-dagestan-us-warns-of-decisive-nuclear-response","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-26T17:59:11Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russian conscripts being sent straight to front, Kyiv says; UK sanctions Russians linked to ‘sham referendums’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-updates-anti-mobilisation-protests-in-dagestan-us-warns-of-decisive-nuclear-response","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-updates-anti-mobilisation-protests-in-dagestan-us-warns-of-decisive-nuclear-response","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russian conscripts being sent straight to front, Kyiv says; UK sanctions Russians linked to ‘sham referendums’ – as it happened","bodyText":"Summary It’s almost 9pm in Kyiv. Here are the day’s key events across Ukraine, Russia and beyond. Nato air forces conduct drills over Baltic Sea. Member states including the UK, Germany, Italy took part in the military training, both over water and on land, in an effort to boost eastern defences. The Netherlands increases its military support for Ukraine. Prime minister Mark Rutte also announced new sanctions in response to Russia’s mobilisation and referendum. The US pledges to provide Ukraine with $457.5m in civilian security aid. The support is aimed at “saving lives” and “bolstering” Ukrainian law enforcement, secretary of state Antony Blinken said. The Russian Orthodox Church head says Russian soldiers who die on the battlefield will have their sins absolved. Patriach Kirill – a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and a staunch supporter of the Ukraine invasion – said the “sacrifice washes away all sins”. The UK announces 92 new sanctions in response to Russia’s regime of illegal referendums in Ukraine. The package of penalties target those behind the sham votes as well as oligarchs and board members. Germany debates whether it should grant asylum to Russian war refuseniks. The country is potentially prepared to give protection to deserters who face repercussions if they refuse to fight, but each case would be decided on an individual basis amid security concerns. The UN’s atomic energy watchdog says it was ready for talks about setting up a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency head met the foreign ministers from both Russia and Ukraine at the UN general assembly last week to discuss the possibility. Horrific consequences are in store if Russia follows through with its thinly-veiled threats to use nuclear weapons, the US warns. Secretary of state Antony Blinken said any use of the weapons would have a “catastrophic” impact across the world. Ukraine claims some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation were being sent directly to the frontlines without training. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. A Russian man shoots the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town after telling him he would refuse to fight in Ukraine. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. Long queues of vehicles form at the border crossing between Russia and Mongolia as people continue to flee the Kremlin’s mobilisation order. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag said more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy vows to liberate the entire country as Russia presses on with its supposed referendum in occupied areas of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said the country’s armed forces would throw out Russia’s forces and retaliate against “every strike of the aggressor”. The UK’s chief of defence staff hosted talks with the Russian defence attaché at the Ministry of Defence in London. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin and Colonel Maxim Elovik met as part of ongoing efforts to “strengthen military to military channels of communication” with Russia. A number of Nato member states have begun to conduct air force drills in the Baltic Sea. Over the next two days, air forces from the UK, Germany, Italy and others will take part in military training both over water and on land in an effort to boost eastern defences. “For the first time we are including both air- and surface-based integrated air and missile defence activities in our drills,” said exercise planner Squadron Leader Craig Docker from Combined Air Operations Centre Uedem. “This underlines how the allies are shielding the eastern flank and – at the same time – prepare for meaningful execution of NATO’s deter and defence concept in the Baltic region.” The Netherlands will increase its military support for Ukraine as well as impose new sanctions against Russia, its prime minister has said. Following a call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Mark Rutte announced he would step up the response to Russia’s mobilisation and referendum. The announcement came following a pledge from the US to provide Ukraine with $457.5m in civilian security aid. The support is aimed at “saving lives” and “bolstering” Ukrainian law enforcement, secretary of state Antony Blinken has said. The head of the Russian Orthodox Church has said Russian soldiers who die in the war against Ukraine will have their sins absolved. Patriach Kirill – a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and a staunch supporter of the Ukraine invasion – has previously criticised those who opposed the war “Many are dying on the fields of internecine warfare,” he said, in his first address since the mobilisation order. “The Church prays that this battle will end as soon as possible, so that as few brothers as possible will kill each other in this fratricidal war.” “But at the same time, the Church realises that if somebody, driven by a sense of duty and the need to fulfil their oath, goes to do what their duty calls of them, and if a person dies in the performance of this duty, then they have undoubtedly committed an act equivalent to sacrifice. “They will have sacrificed themselves for others. And therefore, we believe that this sacrifice washes away all the sins that a person has committed.” A suspected mass grave in an industrial chicken farm in Kharkiv is being investigated by Ukrainian forces, local officials have said. It is feared up to 100 bodies were buried in the site which was once used by Russian troops to shelter their tanks. The area was recaptured by Ukrainian soldiers who pushed Russian forces back over the border earlier this month, however demining teams have yet to sweep the area for unexploded shells. Summary It’s a little past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: The UK announced 92 new sanctions in response to Russia’s regime of illegal referendums in Ukraine. The package of penalties target those behind the sham votes as well as oligarchs and board members. The UN’s atomic energy watchdog said it was ready for talks about setting up a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said he met the foreign ministers from both Russia and Ukraine at the UN general assembly last week to discuss the possibility. Horrific consequences will be in store if Russia follows through with its thinly-veiled threats to use nuclear weapons, the US warned. Secretary of state Antony Blinken said any use of the weapons would have a “catastrophic” impact across the world. Ukraine claimed some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation were being sent directly to the frontlines without training. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. The Kremlin said no decisions have yet been made on closing Russian borders. President Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation has seen hundreds attempt to flee Russia prompting calls for a ban on military-aged men crossing the border. Ukraine’s mayor of Sievierodonetsk decried what he called the “lie and propaganda” of the “referendum from the Russian Federation”. Oleksandr Stryuk accused pro-Russian forces of bussing people in from Crimea to vote and to stage propaganda photographs. The UK has announced a package of sanctions in response to Russia’s regime of illegal referendums in Ukraine. The 92 sanctions target those behind the sham votes across the four Ukrainian regions, as well as individuals that continue to prop up Russia’s war. Among the 33 officials being sanctioned over the referendums are Sergei Yeliseyev, the head of the recently installed government in Kherson, Ivan Kusov, the minister of education and science in the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, and Yevhen Balytskyi, the supposed head of government in Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia. Sanctions have also been placed on oligarchs – including the “kings of Russian real estate” God Nisanov and Zarakh Iliev – with a net worth totalling £6.3bn, and board members from state organisations. “Sham referendums held at the barrel of a gun cannot be free or fair and we will never recognise their results. They follow a clear pattern of violence, intimidation, torture, and forced deportations in the areas of Ukraine Russia has seized,” the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said. Russia’s Tass news agency is carrying some additional quotes from Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán, in which he suggests he will hold a national consultation in Hungary on whether the EU should continue sanctions against Russia. It quotes Orbán saying: The sanctions were introduced in an undemocratic way, because it was the decision of the bureaucrats in Brussels, for which the European people are paying. We need to know the opinion of the people. For the first time in Europe, in Hungary, we will ask for the opinion about sanctions. National consultations will be launched, within which the Hungarian people will be able to express their opinion whether they support them and whether they are in favour of introducing new ones. Tass reports that Orbán stressed he was in favour of “immediate peace talks and a ceasefire” between Ukraine and the Russian forces that invaded the country on 24 February. This is a reminder that later today the Guardian is hosting a livestream event featuring historian Timothy Snyder in conversation with the Guardian’s foreign correspondent Luke Harding talking about how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has changed the world. The event starts at 8pm BST, and you can find more details and book tickets here. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukraine’s mayor of Sievierodonetsk, has posted to Telegram decrying what he called the “lie and propaganda” of the “referendum from the Russian Federation”. Stating it was “not a referendum”, Stryuk wrote: Realising that even this will not work and local residents will refuse to ‘vote’, the occupiers brought several buses of people from Crimea to Melitopol and Berdyansk the day before. They were supposed to help create an image for propagandist media. He went on to say: Another way of agitating people is intimidation, bullying, humiliation. During the period of martial law, 515 people were abducted, more than 200 of them still remain hostages. Also, the enemy continues to shell our free territory. The occupier creates unbearable living conditions for the civilian population by attacking power stations and social infrastructure. Do not respond to fakes and provocations of the occupiers. Let’s hold on! Believe in armed forces of Ukraine! The claims have not been independently verified. Mykhailo Fedorov, who is digital minister in Ukraine, has posted an image of telecommunications repair work being carried out in “recently liberated territories of Kharkiv region”. The UN’s atomic energy watchdog said it is ready to hold talks in Russia and Ukraine on setting up a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said he met the foreign minister from both countries at the UN general assembly last week to discuss the possibility of a protection zone. “This must be done, and I am ready to continue these consultations in both countries so we can protect this plant,” he said. “The work there will allow us to stabilise the situation that is simply unacceptable. And I’m convinced that it’s something we can do. He insisted there must be an end to the war and the IAEA must do everything in its power to prevent a nuclear accident that “would add tragedy to the suffering”. Germany is furiously debating whether, and if so, under what conditions, it should be giving asylum to some of the tens of thousands of Russian war refuseniks, conscientious objectors and deserters who are seeking asylum abroad. Interior minister Nancy Faeser said Germany is potentially prepared to give protection to deserters from anywhere in the world who face repercussions if they refuse to fight, but that cases would have to be decided on an individual basis amid security concerns. Experts are warning of the high likelihood that agents of the federal security service, FSB – successor to the KGB – might use the opportunity to infiltrate the country. Security expert Christoph de Vries has warned Vladimir Putin might use this chance to try to smuggle large numbers of Russian agents into Germany, but asylum experts have also urged the government to be wary of the fact that those who refuse to fight face persecution at home. The interior ministry has also been keen to point out that this legislation, recently introduced by the EU, will protect Germany from a huge flow of Russians entering the country. Berlin is keen for there to be a joint European stance, not least wary of the fact that if it officially signals its readiness to give asylum to Russian males, it could be inundated with hundreds of thousands of them and their families. Other European countries, such as Poland, have refused to do so, while Latvia and Estonia have introduced a ban on Russians entering their countries, and Finland is in the process of doing so, after 20,000 reportedly crossed over the border at the weekend. Slovakia meanwhile, has said it will decide very carefully on a case by case basis. Russian sanctions imposed by the European Union have backfired leading to increasing energy prices, Hungary’s prime minister has said. Criticising the action taken by the west, Viktor Orbán said it was no surprise governments across Europe were falling apart – in particular Italy, where far-right leader Giorgia Meloni is on course to become the country’s first female prime minister. Horrific consequences will be in store if Russia follows through with its thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine, the US has warned. While announcing the mobilisation of reservists last week, Vladimir Putin again warned nuclear arms were a possibility prompting the US to send back a private warning of its own. “We have been very clear with the Russians, publicly as well as privately, to stop the loose talk about nuclear weapons,” secretary of state Antony Blinken told CBS. “It is very important that Moscow hears from us and know from us that the consequences would be horrific. And we’ve made that very clear. “Any use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic effects for the country using them but for many others as well.” Ukraine’s armed forces general staff has claimed some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation are being sent directly to the frontlines in Ukraine without training. Amid warnings from the UK’s Ministry of Defence and other experts that many of those conscripted were likely to get little meaningful training – and faced the risk of “high rates of attrition” when deployed – men recently mobilised by pro-Russian occupation officials in Ukraine were also being readied for the frontline. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. The latest moves came as it was reported that Russia has also closed its border to occupied areas of Ukraine with the neighbouring Rostov region for entry and exit ordering locals to appear at military enlistment offices within three days The first wave of Russian conscripts have begun arriving for training in Russia amid widespread scepticism among outside western analysts over what impact the call up was likely to have on Russian capabilities in Ukraine. Following Ukraine’s success in retaking thousands of square kilometres of territory in the Kharkiv region, heavy fighting was reported on Monday morning including in the area of Lyman in the Donetsk region. Unconfirmed reports in the past 24 hours described Russian lines collapsing in some areas while video posted on social media was described as showing Ukrainian armour moving through at least one former Russian position littered with burned out vehicles. “The lack of military trainers, and the haste with which Russia has started the mobilisation, suggests that many of the drafted [Russian] troops will deploy to the front line with minimal relevant preparation,” said the UK MoD. The US based Institute for the Study of War was also highly dubious about how the likely effectiveness of the Russian mobilisation. Noting that the Kremlin “is unlikely to overcome fundamental structural challenges”. Decisions are yet to be made on whether to close Russia’s borders amid long queues of vehicles waiting to leave the country, the Kremlin has said. President Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation has seen hundreds attempt to flee Russia prompting calls for a ban on military-aged men crossing the border. In a call with reporters, spokesman Dmitry Peskov acknowledged some call-ups had been issued in error, and that mistakes would be corrected. A Russian man has shot the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town after telling him he would refuse to fight in the war in Ukraine. The incident took place in the city of Ust-Ilimsk, a town of about 85,000 people in the Irkutsk region in Siberia. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. Reports say that at least three shots were fired. Protests against the Vladimir Putin’s partial military mobilisation order appeared to continue on Sunday in the Russian republic of Dagestan, with videos showing standoffs between police and the public. Video footage posted on social media showed police arresting demonstrators protesting against the order to draft 300,000 more Russians to the army for the war effort in Ukraine. Long queues of vehicles were at border crossing between Russia and Mongolia on Sunday as people continued to flee the Kremlin’s mobilisation order, AFP reported. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag told the agency that more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday. Sergei Tsekov, a member of Russia’s upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, has called for the Russian border to be shut “to ban anyone who is of military age from traveling abroad”. The Russian news agency RIA Novosti is carrying some turnout figures for the widely derided “referendums” in occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson which began on Friday. The figures suggest that turnout has been sufficient for the proxy-Russian authorities to declare them legitimate, ranging from 77% in Donetsk to 49% in Kherson. Pro-Russian authorities have claimed that in Rubizhne in occupied Luhansk, a polling station had to be moved to a reserve location after shelling from Ukrainian forces hit the school where it was due to be held. Energoatom, the state-run nuclear enterprise in Ukraine which manages nuclear power stations including the occupied plant at Zaporizhzhia, has accused pro-Russian forces within Zaporizhzhia of staging the appearance that staff voted in the widelycondemned referendum being held in the region. Serbia will not recognise Russian annexation “referendums” in occupied Ukrainian areas. The Serbian foreign minister, Nikola Selakovic, said the referendums “completely contradict our state and national interests, our policy of dealing with territorial integrity, sovereignty and the principle of inviolability of borders”. Two drones launched by Russian forces into the Odesa region in Ukraine hit military objects causing a fire and the detonation of ammunition. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to liberate the entire country as Russia pressed on with its supposed referendum in occupied areas of Ukraine and so-called election workers accompanied by masked gunmen knocked on doors to get people to vote. The Ukrainian president said the country’s armed forces would throw out Russia’s forces and retaliate against “every strike of the aggressor”. He vowed that Ukraine would regain control of the southern Kherson region and the eastern Donbas, saying: “Every murderer and torturer will be brought to justice.” Ukraine’s president renewed calls for western allies to cut Russian banks from Swift, the global banking system that allows banks to send messages to each other. “If we cut Russian banks from Swift, we need to cut all Russian banks from Swift,” he said. Zelenskiy has also claimed in a US television interview that Ukraine has discovered two more mass burial sites containing the bodies of hundreds of people in the north-eastern town of Izium. Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has said explicitly for the first time today that he founded the Wagner mercenary group and confirmed its deployment to countries in Latin America and Africa. Moldova’s president Maia Sandu has said that her country may revoke the citizenship of those who go to fight for Russia in Ukraine. Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko is meeting Putin on Monday in Sochi. Japan will ban exports of chemical weapons-related goods to Russia, and is “deeply concerned” about the possible use of nuclear weapons, chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Monday. Moldova’s president Maia Sandu has said that her country may revoke the citizenship of those who go to fight for Russia in Ukraine, according to a report from Reuters. Sandu said there was a risk that some people with dual Moldovan and Russian citizenship could be called up to fight. “To prevent that happening, we are analysing the possibility of applying the process of revoking Moldovan citizenship for those people (with Russian passports) who fight on the side of the aggressor,” Sandu said. “We are also looking at the possibility of making punishment harsher for Moldovan citizens (without Russian passports) … who are in the ranks of the aggressor’s armed forces,” she said. The Russian news agency RIA Novosti is carrying some turnout figures for the widely derided “referendums” in occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. The figures suggest that turnout has been sufficient for the proxy-Russian authorities to declare them legitimate, ranging from 77% in Donetsk to 49% in Kherson. Ukraine’s authorities have described the process as a “propaganda show” and it is unlikely that the results will be recognised as official, or that the referendums will be deemed to have been free or fair in many places outside of the Russian Federation. Sergei Tsekov, a member of Russia’s upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, has, according to the RIA Novosti news agency, called for the Russian border to be shut “to ban anyone who is of military age from traveling abroad”. The agency quotes him also saying it is necessary to increase the fine for evading a summons from 3,000 to 50,000 roubles. Here is an image that has been issued of the meeting between Vladimir Putin and the Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko in Sochi in Russia. There are some quite punchy quotes being attributed to Lukashenko about the reports of an exodus of young men from Russia over the partial mobilisation that was announced last week. Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said explicitly for the first time today that he had founded the Wagner mercenary group and confirmed its deployment to countries in Latin America and Africa. Reuters reports Prigozhin said in a statement from his company that he founded the group in order to send fighters to Ukraine’s Donbas region in 2014. He said: “From that moment, on 1 May 2014, a group of patriots was born, which later acquired the name BTG Wagner.” Prigozhin, dubbed “Putin’s chef” because of his Kremlin catering contracts, has previously denied links with Wagner. Last month, Pjotr Sauer reported for the Guardian how the group had become prominent during Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine. In an overnight interview broadcast by CBS in the US, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed Ukraine has discovered two more mass burial sites containing the bodies of hundreds of people in the north-eastern town of Izium. Reuters quotes him telling viewers in the US: “Today I received more information. They found two more mass graves, big graves with hundreds of people. We’re talking about (the) little town of Izium.” Last week, Ukrainian authorities finished exhuming the bodies of 436 people in a mass grave in the town. The regional governor said the majority of them appeared to have died violent deaths, and there were preliminary indications that 30 of them had been tortured.” Reuters has a quick snap that state media in Belarus are reporting that the Belarus leader, Alexander Lukashenko, will meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin today. Russia used Belarus as a staging post for its latest invasion of Ukraine. In February 2022, despite Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying that Russian troops would be “pulled back to their permanent bases” after the conclusion of joint military drills with Belarus, Moscow instead launched its failed attempt to take Kyiv. Two days ago, Lukashenko appeared to rule out mobilisation in Belarus, saying: “The mobilisation is in Russia … there will be no mobilisation (here).” Gen Sir Richard Barrons, former commander joint forces command in the British army, has been interviewed on Sky News this morning in the UK. He told viewers that Russia’s newly mobilised recruits “won’t be very well trained and probably not very well equipped”, and that “they won’t necessarily be very enthusiastic”. He said: “Russia would have to invest in training and equipping these large numbers of people that would take them well into next year. And it just doesn’t look like they have the training machinery, the logistics, or the weapons to make this really work anytime soon.” On the battlefield, he said the approaching winter weather would make an impact, explaining: “It gets wet in October, which means that moving tanks and trucks and big loads of artillery ammunition becomes harder and slower. “And then as the cold comes in, simply living in the field is harder. Shorter hours of daylight mean something simple like using drones that don’t have night vision capability becomes more restricted. The weather will slow things down. But the war won’t stop just because it gets cold.” He was dismissive that the widely derided referendums being carried out would make a strategic difference to Ukraine, saying: “The key question though, is whether [the Ukrainians] can sustain that forward movement in the north and the south.” He added “[The referendum] is just a device that allows [Russia] to claim that this territory, this part of Ukraine is somehow now magicked into Russia, and therefore could be protected by the full force of the Russian state. It is going to make no difference to what Ukraine does. It should make no difference to what the west does in supporting Ukraine.” Energoatom, the state-run nuclear enterprise in Ukraine which manages nuclear power stations including the occupied plant at Zaporizhzhia, has accused pro-Russian forces within Zaporizhzhia of staging the appearance that staff voted in the widely-condemned referendum being held in the region. It said on Telegram: They staged another performance near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, pretending to be the staff of the nuclear plant as invited mobsters. A large group of men in civilian clothes waited for the end of the shift at the station and mingled with its staff who were leaving after the shift. Along the way, those lined up gave interviews to pro-Russian propaganda media and shouted words of support for Russia and the pseudo-referendum, after which they went to the bus in which the “voting” was held and demonstratively filled out the ballots. This fact once again proves that among the patriotic workers of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, no one volunteered to participate in the occupying farce, so the propagandists were once again forced to make a “good” picture for Russian customers. The claims have not been independently verified. Here is another image from inside occupied Mariupol, which shows the city’s mayor imposed by Russian authorities, Konstantin Ivashchenko, alongside an armed guard as “voting” takes place in the open air in the city. Andrew Roth reports for the Guardian from Moscow: A Russian man has shot the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town after telling him he would refuse to fight in the war in Ukraine. The incident took place in the city of Ust-Ilimsk, a town of about 85,000 people in the Irkutsk region in Siberia. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. Reports say that at least three shots were fired. There are conflicting reports about whether the commandant, who also heads the local draft board, has died. Video showed him being carried from the building and placed on to a stretcher. He was not moving in the video. The Irkutsk regional governor, Igor Kobzev, wrote on the Telegram messaging app that the draft office head was in hospital in a critical condition, and that the detained shooter “will absolutely be punished”. According to a witness, the man shot the military commandant after he had given a “clumsy” pep talk for the men to go and fight in Ukraine. “Nobody is going to go anywhere,” the man said moments before opening fire, a witness told the Baikal People news outlet. It is the latest incident tied to Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a partial mobilisation that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of Russian men receiving their call-up papers. A half-dozen draft centres have been torched in arson attacks in the last week, and police made hundreds of arrests across the country in order to disperse local protests sparked by the announcement. Alex Rossi is the Sky News correspondent in Moscow. He has offered this analysis this morning, saying: We’re now five days into this [mobilisation]. It doesn’t seem to really have gone down very well. Bear in mind that Russia, of course, is a very heavily securitised police state where dissent isn’t tolerated, but there have been sporadic protests all over the country. The number of people that they’re trying to draft is 300,000. That’s almost double the initial invasion force. So it is a reflection of how badly things are going on the battlefield for the Kremlin, and just shows that they have a very significant manpower problem. How these protests continue, we don’t know whether they will grow, there’s certainly the possibility of a really significant domestic backlash. Although they are small, it is significant that they’re happening at all, and that will be a serious worry for Vladimir Putin going forward. The Tass news agency is reporting that in Rubizhne in occupied Luhansk, a polling station for the widely-derided referendum being held there by proxy Russian authorities has had to be moved to a reserve location after shelling from Ukrainian forces hit the school where it was due to be held. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia’s RIA Novosti agency is carrying a quote from Kirill Stremousov, who is one of the leaders of the Russian-imposed administration in the occupied Kherson region. It reports he says he anticipates Kherson becoming part of the Russian Federation at the earliest opportunity, saying: My personal opinion: this will happen in the near future, because the sooner we become part of the Russian Federation, becoming a full-fledged subject, the sooner we will be able to establish a peaceful life. The “referendums” organised by the occupying authorities in eastern Ukraine continue today. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has posted a status update to Telegram of damage caused overnight in his region by Russian shelling. He claims that an attack was made on an industrial zone on the outskirts of the city and that more than 15 houses and a school were damaged in one village, while one two-story residential building and an agricultural enterprise in another were hit. No casualties have been recorded overnight. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog, and I will be with you for the next few hours. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Japan will ban exports of chemical weapons-related goods to Russia, and is “deeply concerned” about the possible use of nuclear weapons, chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Monday. Reuters reported that Japan also added 21 Russian organisations, such as science labs, to the list of entities subject to export bans. “Japan is deeply concerned about the possibility of nuclear weapons used during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Matsuno told media, adding Japan will continue to work with the international society in supporting Ukraine and sanctioning Russia. The news that Giorgia Meloni has claimed victory in Italy’s elections, putting her on course to create the most rightwing government since the end of the second world war, is unlikely to be welcomed by Paris or Brussels. They are seeking to keep Europe united in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine. Meloni has condemned Russia’s invasion and supported sending weapons to Ukraine, but it remains unclear whether her government will back the eighth round of EU sanctions being discussed in Brussels. Matteo Salvini, whose far-right League forms part of her coalition, has claimed the sanctions were bringing Italy to its knees. However, he never blocked any EU measures against Russia when in Mario Draghi’s broad coalition government, which collapsed in July. The initial tranches of men called up under Russia’s partial mobilisation have started arriving at military bases, according to the UK Ministry of Defence’s latest update. Many tens of thousands of call-up papers have been issued, according to UK MoD, which said Russia will faces an administrative and logistical challenge to provide training for the troops. Here is the UK analysis: Unlike most western armies, the Russian military provides low-level, initial training to soldiers within their designated operational units, rather than in dedicated training establishments. Typically, one battalion within each Russian brigade will remain in garrison if the other two deploy and can provide a cadre of instructors to train new recruits or augmentees. However, Russia has deployed many of these third battalions to Ukraine. Many of the drafted troops will not have had any military experience for some years. The lack of military trainers, and the haste with which Russia has started the mobilisation, suggests that many of the drafted troops will deploy to the frontline with minimal relevant preparation. They are likely to suffer a high attrition rate. The US has warned Russia privately of “catastrophic” consequences if it uses nuclear weapons, US officials said. Russian President Vladimir Putin made a thinly veiled threat to use nuclear arms in a speech last week as he announced the mobilization of reservists. “It’s very important that Moscow hear from us and know from us that the consequences would be horrific. And we’ve made that very clear,” Blinken said of Putin’s comments as he spoke to the CBS News program “60 Minutes”. Two drones launched by Russian forces into the Odesa region in Ukraine hit military objects causing a fire and the detonation of ammunition, according to a report by Reuters. “As a result of a large-scale fire and the detonation of ammunition, the evacuation of the civilian population was organised,” the South command of Ukraine’s forces said in a statement on the Telegram. “Preliminarily, there have been no casualties.” It’s just past 8.10am in Ukraine. Here are the latest developments: The United States and its allies will act “decisively” if Russia uses a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the US national security adviser said. Jake Sullivan told CBS on Sunday: “We have communicated directly, privately and at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the US and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail.” Protests against the Vladimir Putin’s partial military mobilisation order appeared to continue on Sunday in the Russian republic of Dagestan, with videos showing standoffs between police and the public. Video footage posted on social media showed police arresting demonstrators protesting against the order to draft 300,000 more Russians to the army for the war effort in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to liberate the entire country as Russia pressed on with its supposed referendum in occupied areas of Ukraine and so-called election workers accompanied by masked gunmen knocked on doors to get people to vote. The Ukrainian president said the country’s armed forces would throw out Russia’s forces and retaliate against “every strike of the aggressor”. He vowed that Ukraine would regain control of the southern Kherson region and the eastern Donbas, saying: “Every murderer and torturer will be brought to justice.” The UK prime minister, Liz Truss, has said its allies France and the US should continue to support Ukraine in the face of the Russian president’s increased threats and his military call-up. Truss said Vladimir Putin was escalating the war because he was not winning and had made a mistake. Long queues of vehicles were at border crossing between Russia and Mongolia on Sunday as people continued to flee the Kremlin’s mobilisation order, AFP reported. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag told the agency that more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday. Serbia will not recognise Russian annexation “referendums” in occupied Ukrainian areas. The Serbian foreign minister, Nikola Selakovic, said the referendums “completely contradict our state and national interests, our policy of dealing with territorial integrity, sovereignty and the principle of inviolability of borders”. Zelenskiy has renewed calls for western allies to cut Russian banks from Swift, the global banking system that allows banks to send messages to each other. “If we cut Russian banks from Swift, we need to cut all Russian banks from Swift,” he said. Zelenskiy also said that Ukraine has received Nasams (national advance surface-to-air missile systems) air defence missiles from the US. In a TV interview, Zelenskiy thanked President Joe Biden and confirmed that Ukraine now had the systems in the country. Zelenskiy also said Russia’s military call-up was a tacit acknowledgment that its “army is not able to fight”. Thousands of Hassidic Jewish pilgrims flocked to central Ukraine to mark the Jewish new year on Sunday, ignoring international travel warnings as Russian forces attacked more targets from the air. The pilgrims, many travelling from Israel and farther afield, converged on the small city of Uman, the burial site of Nachman of Breslov, a respected Hassidic rabbi who died in 1810, Associated Press reported. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK has issued a plea for continued “generosity” and “patience” from those offering a home to refugees in Britain. Vadym Prystaiko said Ukraine needed “much more” help from the UK as the country fought Moscow’s invasion, with the Kremlin’s military call-up amounting to “something formidable”. Israel will treat 20 Ukrainian soldiers who have been injured in the war with Russia, according to the Israeli ambassador to Ukraine. The first two patients would arrive on Sunday for treatment at Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv, envoy Michael Brodsky said. Aiden Aslin, one of the five British nationals released by Russia last week, has given his first media interview after returning to the UK. He told the Sun on Sunday that he was kept in solitary confinement for five months and “treated worse than a dog”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-65-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-29T10:51:44Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 65 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-65-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-65-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 65 of the invasion","bodyText":"Russia attacked western Kyiv with two cruise missiles late yesterday, as the UN secretary general visited the Ukrainian capital. Two loud explosions rocked Kyiv on Thursday evening, after António Guterres went to the site of massacres and mass graves on the city’s outskirts, and met Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces destroyed the production facilities of a space-rocket plant in Kyiv with high-precision long-range missiles. It is being reported that the journalist Vera Girich was killed in the missile strikes on the city. The ministry posted a video claiming to show cruise missiles being launched into Ukraine from a submarine of the Black Sea fleet. Ukraine hopes to evacuate civilians who are holed up in the Azovstal steel plant with the last fighters defending the southern city of Mariupol. “An operation is planned today to get civilians out of the plant,” Zelenskiy’s office said, without giving details. A checkpoint at the Russian village of Krupets in the Kursk region came under fire, according to Kursk’s governor, Roman Starovoyt. Russian gains in Donbas have come at a “significant cost” to its forces, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence report. The International Atomic Energy Agency says it is investigating a report that a missile had flown directly over a nuclear power station, adding it would be “extremely serious” if true. The US president, Joe Biden, called for a $33bn package of military and economic aid to Ukraine, more than doubling the level of US assistance to date. Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, who is often seen to be voicing the Kremlin’s views, accused the US of seeking to profit from the war while indebting future generations of Ukrainians. A British citizen has been killed in Ukraine and a second is missing, the Foreign Office has confirmed, amid reports that both were volunteer fighters. The Briton who died was understood to be Scott Sibley, a former soldier who had served in Iraq. The UK will send 8,000 soldiers to eastern Europe on expanded exercises to combat Russian aggression, in one of the largest deployments since the cold war. The UK is also sending experts to help Ukraine with gathering evidence and prosecuting war crimes, with a team expected to arrive in Poland in early May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/oct/23/unseen-and-underhand-putins-hidden-hybrid-war-is-trying-to-break-europes-heart","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-23T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"Unseen and underhand: Putin’s hidden hybrid war is trying to break Europe’s heart","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/23/unseen-and-underhand-putins-hidden-hybrid-war-is-trying-to-break-europes-heart","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/23/unseen-and-underhand-putins-hidden-hybrid-war-is-trying-to-break-europes-heart","fields":{"headline":"Unseen and underhand: Putin’s hidden hybrid war is trying to break Europe’s heart","bodyText":"Nato planners have always worried about the Storskog border crossing in Finnmark, where Arctic Norway comes face to face with the cold reality of Russia. In Soviet times, the 121-mile frontier was a potential flashpoint. The Red Banner Northern Fleet’s nuclear-armed submarines are still based at nearby Murmansk, on the freezing Barents Sea. Reasons to worry afresh about the border are multiplying following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Norwegian police recently arrested several Russians, equipped with drones and cameras, who were showing unusual interest in oil and gas installations. Some of the suspected spies entered via Storskog. Since Russia cut energy supplies to Europe in retaliation for western sanctions – and following last month’s sabotage of the Nord Stream Baltic pipelines – Norway has become Europe’s biggest gas supplier. And while the Oslo government is not directly accusing Moscow, it knows that makes it a prime target for covert hybrid warfare operations. Particular concern centres on the Baltic Pipe, a gas pipeline connecting Norway to Poland and other EU countries, which was inaugurated last month. The obvious worry is that it could suffer Nord Stream’s explosive fate. Theoretically vulnerable, too, in this new era of Russia-Europe hostility, are vital pipelines supplying the UK. “We’re seeing the consequences of the new security situation in Norway,” justice minister Emilie Enger Mehl warned after the arrests. “We can’t rule out further cases.” Following reports of drones buzzing North Sea rigs, Norway and Denmark – plus Nato applicants Finland and Sweden – are all increasing security and maritime patrols. Finland even plans to fence parts of its border with Russia, fearing both an influx of spies and saboteurs and a maliciously orchestrated illegal migrant surge like that on the Belarus-Poland border in 2021. The Storskog route has become popular meanwhile with young Russian men dodging Putin’s mass mobilisation. Russian non-military hybrid warfare takes many forms, all with an identical aim: the execution of “active measures” to harm, confuse, frighten, enfeeble and divide target states while maintaining plausible deniability. Thus the EU and US strongly suspect Putin ordered the Nord Stream sabotage as part of his undeclared energy war on Europe. But he denies it, and they have produced no proof. As the realisation dawns that Russia’s president will stop at nothing, EU leaders wonder what he may do next to undermine support for Ukraine – and weaken their governments. Putin is losing on the battlefield and despite his nuclear threats, plainly fears a head-on conflict with Nato he knows he could lose. Thinking ahead, it’s logical – and prudent – to assume a desperate, heedless Putin will increasingly turn to hybrid attacks in Europe. Very little is off-limits. France worries transatlantic internet cables, essential for western security and communications, are in his sights. Its 2023 budget allocates €3.1m for “ocean floor” defence. An additional €11m has reportedly been earmarked for drones and underwater robots. “We have essential infrastructure which is beyond our territory – cables, satellites and oil and gas pipelines. We’ve been reinforcing their security since the start of the war,” President Emmanuel Macron recently revealed. Britain is playing catch-up. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has promised the UK’s first “multi-role ocean surveillance ship” will be operational in 2023. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, chief of the defence staff, warned in January that severing of communications cables would be viewed as an act of war. But the UK looks unprepared. Adding to the jitters, the break in a subsea communications cable that left Shetland islanders isolated last week remains unexplained. The incident highlighted hybrid warfare’s potential domestic dimension. EU officials admit safeguarding everything from nuclear power plants, utilities and computer systems to airports and hospitals is impossible. This vulnerability was dramatically exposed when sabotage blamed on Russia shut down parts of Germany’s railway network this month. Russia’s hybrid options extend to covert use of special forces and proxy fighters, such as the “little green men” deployed in Crimea in 2014. They include deniable cyber attacks, as suffered by Estonia in August, fake news and disinformation campaigns, as during the 2016 US election and Brexit referendum, and concerted diplomatic deception. Use of “active measures” is hard to prove. Nato declared in 2016 that “hybrid actions” against one or more allies would be viewed as an attack on all under article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty. But the problem is one of definition – what constitutes such an attack? Another problem is agreeing who is responsible. “Hybrid methods of warfare … have long been used to destabilise adversaries. What is new about attacks seen in recent years is their speed, scale and intensity, facilitated by rapid technological change and global interconnectivity,” Nato said in June. “Counter-hybrid support teams” would provide assistance but it was primarily up to individual countries to protect themselves. Hybrid threats are adding to the already considerable political and social strains imposed on Europe by the Ukraine conflict. EU leaders are struggling to agree a gas price cap and other energy crisis measures, while France and Germany are at odds over future defence policy vis-a-vis Russia. A key government-to-government summit this week has been postponed. Macron’s administration is under siege from far-right and far-left opponents, strikers and street protesters angry at rising living costs. Germany’s unpopular chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is struggling to hold a fractious coalition together. Many of the problems they face stem directly from the ever-spreading impact of February’s invasion. Division, disruption, destabilisation: these are the fruits of Putin’s hidden hybrid war. He is losing on the ground in Ukraine. But is he winning the battle to break Europe’s will? Winter is coming – and winter will tell."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2022/mar/04/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T21:00:05Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/04/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/mar/04/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• An article should have described Dr Elizabeth Cooper as a co-curator, rather than curator, of the Sowing Roots exhibition.

But a lot of the analysis from this year’s federal election didn’t consider one important aspect: it was the first in which baby boomers were outnumbered by Millennial and Gen Z voters. According to the 2021 census, Millennials, aged 25-39, are neck and neck with the baby boomers as the largest generational group in Australia, each representing about 21% of the Australian population. A further 18% of the population are members of generation Z (10-24 years old). This is a significant voting bloc who have come of age at a time of economic uncertainty – either the global financial crisis or the Covid pandemic – growing inequality and an increase in extreme weather events, including bushfires and floods. Many of them rent, with homeownership largely out of reach for those without family wealth due to steep rises of property prices, while wages remain stagnant. There’s also rising living costs, which renders consuming the daily recommended vegetable and fruit intake a luxury. This is a demographic that is being closely watched in Victoria as the state heads to the polls in November. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, will say he’s got far too much to do than spend time analysing what the federal result means for the upcoming state poll – his usual refrain is that elections are “always close” with a “handful of votes and a handful of seats” determining the outcome. But he’s spent years courting the Millennial and Gen Z vote, largely by bypassing the media and communicating with them directly via social media. Andrews has even posted a Drake meme on Facebook then told reporters he didn’t know of the Canadian rapper’s songs. Most of his government’s recent announcements seem to be geared towards this cohort, including the introduction of an affirmative consent model, a landmark festival to celebrate LGBTIQ+ Victorians, a two-year trial of paid sick leave for casuals and free kinder. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor faces stiff competition though from the Greens, which earlier this week, the party announced a plan to increase the power of renters across the state and ensure they have access to long-term secure and affordable housing. The plan involves several initiatives, including capping rent increases in line with wage growth, establishing a housing ombudsman and better regulating estate agents. The Greens have also vowed to end new coal and gas projects in the state and move to 100% renewable energy by 2030, build more social housing, increase funding for the corruption watchdog and ban political donations from property developers, fossil fuel companies and gambling – all similar policies to ones that helped the teals and Greens sweep the federal election. They’re also looking to double representation by winning Albert Park, Northcote and Richmond in the lower house and the southern metropolitan region in the upper house. Climate 200, which provided crucial funding for the federal teals, last month polled Victorian voters and found potential support for similar independents in the Liberal-held seats of Brighton, Caulfield, Kew and Sandringham, and the Labor seat of Hawthorn. Independent candidates are also expected to stand in Benambra and the south-west coast, both held by the Liberals, and several Labor seats including Melton and Werribee. There is also a large field of micro-parties contesting upper house. The Coalition, meanwhile, announced last month it will legislate an emission reduction target of 50% by 2030 as well as a pathway to net zero by 2050, bringing it in line with Labor, in a move designed to secure support in inner-urban electorates. But its pledges to support LGBTIQ+ Victorians were affected by the Liberals’ preselection of Moira Deeming as an upper house candidate. The opposition’s integrity policy also came spectacularly undone by revelations leader Matthew Guy’s former chief of staff sought funds inappropriately. Labor has also endured several scandals since coming into office. Whether their policy pledges will be seen as cynical attempts to stop young people abandoning major parties in November remains to be seen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/24/five-predictions-for-the-next-six-months-in-the-war-in-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-24T13:03:07Z","webTitle":"Five predictions for the next six months in the war in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/24/five-predictions-for-the-next-six-months-in-the-war-in-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/24/five-predictions-for-the-next-six-months-in-the-war-in-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Five predictions for the next six months in the war in Ukraine","bodyText":"1. The war will probably run on for a year at least but is essentially deadlocked and its intensity is lessening Six months of war may have gone by, but neither Ukraine nor Russia are ready to stop fighting, despite the losses they have sustained. Ukraine wants its occupied territories back, and Russia wants to keep inflicting pain not just on its opponent but, by proxy, the west also. The Kremlin believes winter will play to its advantage. There have been no negotiations between the two sides since evidence emerged of the massacres at Bucha, Irpin and elsewhere in territories occupied by the Russians north of Kyiv. But movement in the frontlines has been minimal since the fall of Lysychansk at the end of June. Both sides are struggling for momentum and increasingly appear combat-exhausted. 2. Ukraine has no means of effective conventional counterattack, while guerrilla raids are an optimistic way to precipitate a Russian collapse Ukraine would like to retake Kherson, on the west of the Dnieper river, but a senior administration figure admitted in private that “we do not have enough capacity to push them back”. Kyiv has shifted its strategy to mounting long-range missile attacks and daring special forces raids on Russian bases deep behind the frontlines. The key presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the aim was to “create chaos within the Russian forces”, but while this will blunt the invader’s effectiveness, it is not likely it will lead to invaders collapsing in on themselves and voluntarily conceding Kherson, as some Ukrainian officials have hoped. 3. Russia still wants to pound its way forward but its attention is likely to be shifting to holding on its gains and annexing Ukraine territory Russia has no new offensive plan other than to mass artillery, destroy towns and cities and grind its way forward. It does this in part because it is effective, and in part to minimise casualties, having lost, on some western estimates, 15,000 dead so far. It continues to adopt this strategy around Bakhmut in the Donbas but progress is slow, partly because it has had to redeploy some forces to reinforce Kherson. The Kremlin may not have achieved what it hoped at the beginning of the war, but Russia now holds large swathes of Ukrainian territory in the east and south, and is actively talking about holding annexation referendums. With cooler weather fast approaching, it is likely to focus on consolidating what it has. 4. Winter will precipitate a fresh refugee crisis and create an opportunity for whoever can best prepare Winter is uppermost in strategic thinking for both sides. Ukraine is already anxious about humanitarian issues because there is no gas heating available for apartment blocks in Donetsk province and other frontline areas. One humanitarian official predicted there would be a fresh wave of migration in the winter, with perhaps as many as 2 million people crossing the border into Poland. Russians sees winter as an opportunity. Ukraine fears Russia will target its energy grid, making its heating dilemma more acute, and could simply turn off the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Moscow also wants to prolong the west’s pain over energy costs and has every incentive to rack up the pressure. Spring, though, could be the time for a renewed attack – each side will want to replenish and prepare for what is likely to be another fighting season. 5. The west needs to decide if it wants Ukraine to win or just hold on – and it needs to match humanitarian help to the huge need Ukraine would have been defeated without western military aid. But at no point so far has the west supplied enough artillery or other weapons, such as fighter jets, that would allow Kyiv to drive the invaders back. Politicians talk about the need to force Russia to the prewar borders but do not provide enough materiel to do it. At the same time, Ukraine’s humanitarian need is growing. There is, for example, nowhere near enough money for reconstruction – and many homes north-east and north-west of Kyiv remain ruined five months after the Russians left, often with despairing residents living in garages or temporary structures on site. People who are displaced internally often have to live in schools or kindergartens, temporary accommodation that people struggle to stay in for an extended period of time. Ukraine has a budget gap of $5bn (£4.2bn) a month because of the war; aid and reconstruction will cost many times that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-303-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-23T18:48:19Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 303 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-303-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-303-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 303 of the invasion","bodyText":"President Vladimir Putin has ordered his country’s defence industry chiefs to ensure the Russian army gets all the weapons, equipment and military hardware it needs “in the shortest possible timeframes” to fight in Ukraine. Putin’s remarks came just days after he pledged to give his army anything it asks for in a meeting with Russia’s top military officials. Russian forces have started demolishing a theatre in occupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine that was the site of a deadly airstrike believed to have killed hundreds of civilians, according to an aide to the city’s exiled Ukrainian mayor. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said the move was an “attempt to hide forever the evidence of the deliberate killing of Ukrainians by Russians”. North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the United States for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, the North’s official KCNA news agency reported on Friday. Japan’s Tokyo Shimbun reported earlier that North Korea had shipped munitions, including artillery shells, to Russia via train through their border last month and that additional shipments were expected in the coming weeks. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a video on Friday saying he was back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office. We are working toward victory,” he said in the video posted to his Telegram channel. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to the White House confirmed that Ukraine and the US are “strategic partners” for the first time in history, the Ukrainian leader’s most senior adviser has said. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, told the Guardian that the trip on Wednesday had cemented Zelenskiy’s bond with the US president, Joe Biden – and with senior US Republicans. Russian forces shelled the recently liberated Kherson region more than 60 times on Thursday, according to the head of the region’s military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych. Two civilians were killed by Russian shelling on the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine Friday morning, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. Two people were injured after a car bomb exploded in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in south-eastern Ukraine, according to a local pro-Moscow official. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia province, described the incident as a “terrorist attack” carried out by “militants of the Kyiv regime” to the Russian state media. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, wrote on Telegram that eyewitnesses reported a car was “blown up”. A senior Russian diplomat has said that talks on security guarantees for Russia cannot take place while Nato instructors and “mercenaries” remain in Ukraine, and while western arms supplies to the country continue. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency TASS, Alexander Darchiev, head of the Russian foreign ministry’s North America department, said talks would be premature “until the flood of weapons and financing for the [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskiy regime stops, American and Nato servicemen/mercenaries/instructors are withdrawn”. Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, warned the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high” and compared US-Russia relations to an “ice age” in comments reported by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency. The Kremlin on Thursday accused the US of fighting a proxy war against Russia, after Washington boosted military support for Ukraine and hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the White House and Congress. The Kremlin has claimed that Russia has made significant progress towards “demilitarising” Ukraine – one of the initial goals of Russia’s invasion 10 months ago. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, was asked during a briefing about comments by President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine’s military-industrial complex “if not completely reset to zero, is getting there fast”. The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, had “almost stopped”. Speaking on Russian state television, Russian-installed regional governor Yevgeny Balitsky said that Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control. Australia’s financial intelligence agency has warned Russian paramilitary groups are soliciting cryptocurrency donations to buy weapons and that Australians have donated to terrorist organisations overseas. Senior executives at Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) also said cryptocurrency has become a “standard part of the money-laundering tool kit” for organised crime groups in Australia. Air raid sirens were sounding shortly before 7am in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, the regional governor Vitalli Kim indicated on Telegram, in a series of posts saying, “Air alarm”. Kherson governor Yaroslav Yanushevych also posted an air raid alarm, but shortly afterwards said that the alert was over. A Russian opposition politician has filed a legal challenge over President Vladimir Putin’s use of the word “war” to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Putin on Thursday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, after 10 months of calling his campaign a “special military operation”. The White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the Patriot air defence the US was supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed on Thursday in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”. The report has not been able to be independently verified. German authorities said they arrested an employee of the country’s foreign intelligence service on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing information to Russia. The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L, was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen it suspected of spying for Russia. Vladimir Putin called Israel’s prime minister-designate, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Thursday to congratulate him on forming a government and to discuss the situation in Ukraine, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Netanyahu told Putin “he hopes a way will be found quickly to end the war [with Ukraine] and the suffering caused by it”, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/aug/01/like-an-alien-obelisk-space-debris-found-in-snowy-mountains-paddock-believed-to-be-from-spacex-mission","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T14:07:15Z","webTitle":"‘Like an alien obelisk’: space debris found in Snowy Mountains paddock believed to be from SpaceX mission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/01/like-an-alien-obelisk-space-debris-found-in-snowy-mountains-paddock-believed-to-be-from-spacex-mission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/aug/01/like-an-alien-obelisk-space-debris-found-in-snowy-mountains-paddock-believed-to-be-from-spacex-mission","fields":{"headline":"‘Like an alien obelisk’: space debris found in Snowy Mountains paddock believed to be from SpaceX mission","bodyText":"The Australian Space Agency is investigating space debris found in farmland in the Snowy Mountains in southern NSW, after being notified by an astrophysicist who believes it to be from a SpaceX mission. Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at the Australian National University, says he often gets calls from people who believe they’ve found space junk – and they are normally easy to rule out. “This was different,” he said. Tucker received a call last Thursday from Mick Miners and Jock Wallace, two sheep farmers in the small town of Dalgety, who reported having found a scorched object. Their report matched a SpaceX spacecraft which re-entered the earth’s atmosphere at 7am on 9 July, 20 months after its launch in November 2020. The farmers were connected to Tucker via ABC local radio, where he is a regular guest to talk about space. The SpaceX Dragon capsule was observed breaking apart above the area of Australia where the farmers found the debris. Its re-entry was seen and heard by people from Canberra to Bendigo, with many sharing it on social media. Tucker drove for two hours to Miners’ farm to see if the object they had found was the unpressurised trunk of the capsule – a structure that is needed for take-off but dumped prior to re-entry. His first impression, he said, was something that “kind of just looks like a burnt tree … and then you come up to it, it’s like this alien obelisk almost”. “I knew without a doubt this was a very real incident and a very real piece just sticking out of the ground.” Tucker said he could tell it was real because it was made of composite materials designed to withstand heat, including woven carbon fibre for insulation. It also showed clear signs of scorching due to re-entry. One of the panels of the debris appeared to have had a part number. “It’s a very easy way for SpaceX to confirm it because there’s a label on it,” he says. He documented the discovery on YouTube. SpaceX has not yet confirmed to Tucker that the debris belonged to SpaceX Dragon, and has not yet responded to a request from Guardian Australia. The debris has been assessed by the Australian Space Agency (ASA). A spokesperson from ASA told Guardian Australia their technical experts had “visited a remote part of the Snowy Mountains area of southern New South Wales, after the discovery of space debris”. “The agency is actively working to support formal identification of the objects, and is engaging with our counterparts in the US, as well as other parts of the commonwealth and local authorities as appropriate,” the spokesperson said. Tucker says space junk is intended to land in the ocean, and it’s a “super rare” occurrence for it to land in a populated area. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It’s only happened a handful of times,” he says. “In 1979, the US Space station Skylab crashed over Western Australia in the first instance. There was a nuclear power Russian satellite that crashed in Canada in the 80s. And then China had a rocket booster that crashed and landed in West Africa a couple of years ago. SpaceX had part of a booster crash in the US state of Washington last year. And now this.” It’s a short list, but the incidents are becoming more frequent. Dr Sara Webb, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University, agreed with Tucker’s assessment that the debris was consistent with a SpaceX mission. Webb said that this event and the Chinese booster rocket, which made an uncontrolled return to Earth on Saturday, underscored the importance of tracking space debris. The Chinese booster rocket was particularly large, she said. “Even if 80% of it burnt up, you’re still left with basically a car coming out of the atmosphere,” she said. The spokesperson for ASA said the organisation was “committed to the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, including debris mitigation”. “This includes the ongoing development of a Space Situational Awareness and Debris Mitigation roadmap, to guide opportunities in this important area,” the ASA said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/may/01/new-york-nuclear-power-indian-point","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-01T15:02:10Z","webTitle":"End of an era: closure of nuclear plant is pointer for New York’s energy future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/01/new-york-nuclear-power-indian-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/may/01/new-york-nuclear-power-indian-point","fields":{"headline":"End of an era: closure of nuclear plant is pointer for New York’s energy future","bodyText":"America’s energy past and future was on display on Friday at Indian Point, a nuclear plant 25 miles north of New York City that has been producing electricity since 1962. At 11am the last of the ageing plant’s reactor turbines shut down, ending a long political standoff. At the same time, wind and sun over the Hudson River alongside the plant pointed to the state’s energy future. Environmentalists and politicians have described the plant as a threat to millions. Many welcomed the closure. “There are 20 million people living within 50 miles of Indian Point and there is no way to evacuate them in case of a radiological release,” Paul Gallay, president of the environmental group Riverkeeper, told the Associated Press. In part, the plant was doomed by the attacks on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 – the pilots of the hijacked planes used the river for navigation, alerting politicians to the vulnerability of the reactors on the banks of the Hudson. “The plant was built to withstand an airplane crash in the 70s,” New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said recently. “Who knows what would happen now with Indian Point?” Furthermore, nuclear power has lost favour as the cost of clean-energy renewables declines. In 2019, Indian Point provided 13% of New York state power. According to operator Entergy, for New York City and the lower Hudson Valley that figure was about 25%. Under a 2017 agreement between Cuomo, Riverkeeper and Entergy, another reactor was shut down a year ago. On Friday in the town of Buchanan, the mood was dark. The plant has provided about 1,000 well-paid jobs and half the town’s tax revenue. A lengthy decommissioning process will cut jobs by two-thirds. “It’s a sad day, the end of an era, and it marks the loss of our largest employer and tax payer,” the mayor of Buchanan, Theresa Knickerbocker, told the Guardian. “I think people really didn’t understand nuclear and I’m hugely disappointed that a clean energy plant is being replaced by two gas plants. We talk about the environment and that’s not environmentally sound.” As the Biden administration pushes for a non-fossil fuel-dependent energy policy, there will inevitably be a period in which more electricity is produced using gas-powered systems, before wind and solar take up the slack. In the long battle over Indian Point, some have seen signs of political meddling. In 2017, the group Environmental Progress noted that two former Cuomo aides worked with a natural gas company, Competitive Power Ventures. The episode was detailed in a federal indictment filed by the then US attorney for the southern district in Manhattan. “Based on my review of publicly available documents and my interviews of witnesses, including employees of [Competitive Power Ventures], the importance of the [CPV Valley Energy Center] to the state depended at least in part, on whether [Indian Point] was going to be shut down,” Preet Bharara wrote. According to Nuclear New York, a group opposing closure, Indian Point produced 81% of downstate clean energy, with solar and hydro making up 2% and 4%. Fossil fuels accounted for 67% of all state production. “We’re going in the wrong direction,” said Pramila Malick, an activist with the group, adding that closing Indian Point and ramping up generation from fracked gas will increase state greenhouse gas emissions by 10%. “The community is being poisoned by particulates,” Malick said. Unions also oppose the closure. James Shillitto, president of UWUA Local 1-2, said it had “no upside, only downside”. “The governor’s for renewable energy,” he said, “which we support. [It] is not going to happen with a magic wand. There isn’t a piece of equipment in the water for offshore wind and there isn’t any utility-scale solar built yet.” More than 20 large-scale renewable energy projects will be under construction this year. Cuomo has promised 70% renewables by 2030 and 100% a decade later. “There are many hurdles to get that done,” Shillitto said. “Nimbyism is going to slow it down. So with the closure of this plant today we’re 1,000 megawatts in the hole. This closure is about fear, unrealistic fear, of a nuclear accident. The history here shows that after 58 years we haven’t had problems.” Critics have pointed to a safety history that includes faulty reactor bolts and radioactive tritium in groundwater onsite. Groups like Riverkeeper say Indian Point kills fish by taking in river water for cooling. Greg Jaczko, head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under Barack Obama and a lecturer at Princeton, told the Guardian the carbon-free energy future will be “exclusively non-nuclear”. “The nuclear industry failed to become a viable solution for carbon-free electricity generation,” he said, noting that of four Obama-era approved plants, two have been abandoned and two are behind schedule and over-budget. “Nuclear is an expensive way to generate carbon-free electricity when there are viable new alternatives. It’s cheaper today to build out renewable generation than it is to continue to operate 40-year-old nuclear power plants.” But Jaczko did not dispute that fossil-fuel generation will increase in the short term. “There may be a period when the overall supply of electricity will see an increased dependence on natural gas,” he said, “but in the long term the trend is to reduce emissions significantly.” Indian Point now faces a 12-year, $2.3bn decommissioning run, subject to approval, by New Jersey-based Holtec International. In 2014, the company was cited by the Guardian for donations to Republican coffers after being granted significant subsidies by the state’s then governor, Chris Christie. According to Jaczko, decommissioning could present problems given the age of the plant and the propensity for reactors in general to present surprises. “My biggest concern is that sufficient resources are set aside because it’s not a revenue-generating business,” he said. “If existing funds do not cover that cost, or it’s not done right, you could end up looking to taxpayers to foot the bill.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jun/22/europe-told-to-get-ready-now-for-russia-to-turn-off-all-gas-exports-iea-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-22T15:33:55Z","webTitle":"Europe told to get ready now for Russia to turn off all gas exports to region","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/22/europe-told-to-get-ready-now-for-russia-to-turn-off-all-gas-exports-iea-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jun/22/europe-told-to-get-ready-now-for-russia-to-turn-off-all-gas-exports-iea-winter","fields":{"headline":"Europe told to get ready now for Russia to turn off all gas exports to region","bodyText":"Europe needs to prepare immediately for Russia to turn off all gas exports to the region this winter, according to the head of the International Energy Agency, who has called on governments to work on reducing demand and keeping nuclear power plants open. Fatih Birol said reductions in supplies in recent weeks which the Kremlin has attributed to maintenance work could, in fact, be the beginning of wider cuts designed to prevent the filling of storage facilities in preparation for winter, as Russia seeks to gain leverage over the region. “Europe should be ready in case Russian gas is completely cut off,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. “The nearer we are coming to winter, the more we understand Russia’s intentions. “I believe the cuts are geared towards avoiding Europe filling storage, and increasing Russia’s leverage in the winter months.” EU countries are racing to refill storage sites, with Germany hoping to reach 90% of capacity by November. Its stores are only half full. Member states have also been working to reduce their reliance on Russian fossil fuels, by sourcing gas from other countries, including the US, and speeding up the switch to renewable energy, although officials have conceded that the race to phase out Russian oil and gas would mean burning more coal and keeping nuclear plants going. Birol said emergency measures taken by European governments to reduce energy demand had probably not gone far enough, and urged countries to work on preserving energy supplies. “I believe there will be more and deeper demand measures as winter approaches,” Birol said. He added that gas supplies may need to be rationed, if Russia were to further reduce gas exports. Moscow has reduced or even cut off gas deliveries to several EU countries in recent weeks, in response to their decision to impose sanctions on the Kremlin over its invasion of Ukraine. Russian gas supplies to Europe received through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline – which runs under the Baltic Sea to Germany – have been falling. Last week, Russia’s state-controlled energy company Gazprom announced the second cut to gas transported via the pipeline, reducing supplies to just 40% of capacity. The Italian energy firm Eni has reported a halving of Gazprom’s gas supplies to Italy, which gets about 40% of its imported gas from Russia. Meanwhile, the French network operator GRTgaz said France had not received any Russian gas via Germany since the middle of May. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov last week blamed maintenance issues for the reductions in supply, a reference to earlier comments saying Russia was unable to secure the return of equipment sent to Canada for repairs. Europe’s benchmark gas price is trading at about €127 (£109) per megawatt hour – up more than 300% on its level a year ago. Analysts at RBC Europe said options are in “short supply” for European policymakers. It believes gas suppliers Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies stand to gain from the supply squeeze, as well as coal producer Glencore. Separately on Wednesday, Ineos Energy signed a deal with US company Sempra Infrastructure for the supply of 1.4m tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas from North America for 20 years. Ineos, controlled by billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, intends to trade the gas and use it in its own industrial operations. The gas will be supplied from two projects in the US Gulf."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/20/ukraine-launches-fresh-strike-on-russias-black-sea-fleet-headquarters","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T14:40:35Z","webTitle":"Ukraine launches fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/20/ukraine-launches-fresh-strike-on-russias-black-sea-fleet-headquarters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/20/ukraine-launches-fresh-strike-on-russias-black-sea-fleet-headquarters","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine launches fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters","bodyText":"Ukraine has launched a fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters at Sevastopol, where officials in the annexed Crimean peninsula said that at least one drone had been shot down by air defences. The reported attack on Saturday morning – a day after explosions erupted near military bases in Russian-held areas of Ukraine and Russia itself – came on the same day that 12 civilians were reportedly wounded when a Russian missile hit a residential area of a Ukrainian town. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, said that four children were among those wounded in an attack that damaged several private houses and a five-storey residential building in Voznesensk, about 19 miles (30km) from the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant. He added that a young girl had lost an eye as a result of the attack on Saturday. While there was no apparent major damage after the reported unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attack on Sevastopol, which has not been independently verified by the Guardian, observers said it demonstrated Ukraine’s ability to strike deep behind Russian lines at prestige targets. Video shared on Twitter appeared to show Russian air defences attempting to destroy the UAV and dark plumes of smoke rising from the city. Mikhail Razvozhayev, Sevastopol’s governor, wrote on Telegram that a drone had hit the roof of the headquarters on Saturday and said there were no casualties, reports the Russian news agency Tass. “I am at the [Black Sea] fleet’s headquarters now. A drone hit the roof here 25 minutes ago. Unfortunately, it was not downed … There are no casualties,” he wrote. Later on Saturday, Crimea’s governor, Sergei Aksyonov, contradicted the earlier statement by saying on Telegram that local air defences shot down the drone above the Black Sea fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. “Air defense systems successfully hit all targets over the territory over Crimea on Saturday morning. There are no casualties or material damage,” his boss, Sergei Aksyonov, said on Telegram. Authorities in Sevastopol reported on Saturday night that the city’s air-defence systems had been called into action again in the evening. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defence ministry on Saturday said its forces had killed a total of 44,900 Russian personnel – a rise of 200 on the day before. On Friday, the US said for the first time that it would provide Ukraine with ScanEagle surveillance drones, mine-resistant vehicles, anti-armour rounds and howitzer weapons in a new £655m aid package to help its efforts to take back Ukrainian territory. “These capabilities are carefully calibrated to make the most difference on the battlefield and strengthen Ukraine’s position at the negotiating table,” Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said. There was cautious optimism on Saturday as two more grain ships left the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk , bringing the total number to leave Ukraine’s Black Sea under a UN-brokered deal to 27. Welcoming the sailings, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Saturday that governments and the private sector should cooperate to bring Russian food and fertilisers as well as Ukrainian grain to world markets under the deal agreed last month. “The other part of this package deal is the unimpeded access to the global markets of Russian food and fertiliser, which are not subject to sanctions,” Guterres told a news conference in Istanbul. “It is important that all governments and the private sector cooperate to bring them to market. Wednesday will mark six months of war in the region since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While Russia has made gains in the east, it has been put on the defensive in other regions as Ukraine scales up its attacks in the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which was seized by Russia in 2014. Last week, a total of nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed at a Crimean airbase. Russian leaders have warned that such strikes indicate an escalation in the conflict, powered by the US and Nato allies. In its latest intelligence update on the conflict, Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MOD) said last week that it saw “only minimal changes in territorial control along the frontline”. In Donbas, it said Russian forces have approached the outskirts of Bakhmut, but have not broken into the city. In the south-west, it reported that neither Ukrainian or Russian forces had made advances on the frontline in occupied Kherson, but added: “Increasingly frequent explosions behind Russian lines are probably stressing Russian logistics and air basing in the south.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jan/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-calls-for-further-sanctions-and-more-weapons-after-latest-strikes","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-27T18:51:25Z","webTitle":"At least 10 civilians killed in new Russian shelling, Kyiv says; fierce fighting in eastern Donetsk battle – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-calls-for-further-sanctions-and-more-weapons-after-latest-strikes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jan/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-calls-for-further-sanctions-and-more-weapons-after-latest-strikes","fields":{"headline":"At least 10 civilians killed in new Russian shelling, Kyiv says; fierce fighting in eastern Donetsk battle – as it happened","bodyText":"It is coming up to 7pm in London – 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest news: A new barrage of Russian shelling has killed at least 10 Ukrainian civilians and wounded 20 others in a day, the Associated Press (AP) reported, citing the office of Ukraine’s president. Regional officials said towns and villages in the east and in the south that are within reach of the Russian artillery suffered most. Six people died in the Donetsk region, two in Kherson, and two in the Kharkiv region, the AP quotes them as saying. A day earlier, missiles and self-propelled drones that Russian forces fired had hit deeper into Ukrainian territory, killing at least 11 people. Ukraine’s army claims to have killed 109 Russian soldiers and wounded a further 188 in one day during fighting around the village of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk oblast. Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern operational command of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the bloody death toll was recorded on Thursday, adding “Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful.” Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine on top of the 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged, the former’s prime minister has said. Mateusz Morawiecki has told CTV News “we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession.” Belgium has announced a package of an additional €93.6m (£84.5m / $104.7m) in military aid for Ukraine. The prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said that, taking into account previous spending, it amounted to the biggest ever military aid package given to another country by Belgium. The package will include surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, machine guns, grenades and munition. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reported that ten regions of Ukraine are using emergency power outages due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” he added. Lynne Tracy, the new US ambassador to Russia, will not improve ties between Washington and Moscow because the former is engaging in a “hybrid war” against the latter, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Friday. Zakharova said Tracy’s room for manoeuvre would be limited due to what she said was fierce anti-Russian bipartisan feeling in the United States. The European Union wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine, EU justice ministers have said. But the member states differ over how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs. The bloc’s 27 justice ministers met in Stockholm, where they discussed collecting evidence as well as setting up a new international tribunal to prosecute Moscow’s aggression. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukrainian government officials who shirk their duties during wartime will be quickly removed, a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday amid a crack down on corruption. More than a dozen officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief Filippo Grandi has said. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. A 74-year-old Spanish man arrested over a spate of letter bombs sent to institutions including the prime minister’s office and the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid in late 2022 was trying to pressure Spain to drop its support for Ukraine, an investigating magistrate said on Friday. The man was remanded in custody as he was considered a flight risk to Russia. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has met the Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, during a tour of African nations to shore up support for Russia, focusing on the “dynamics of the war in Ukraine”, Eritrea’s information minister has said. Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said. Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor says it has blocked the websites of the CIA and FBI, accusing the two US government agencies of spreading false information. Ukraine is setting up drone assault companies within its armed forces that will be equipped with Starlink satellite communications, it has announced, as it presses ahead with an idea to build up an “army of drones”. According to Reuters, the general staff said the commander-in-chief Valeriy Zaluzhnyi signed off on the creation of the units in a project that will involve several ministries and agencies. “The most professional servicemen” have already been chosen to lead the companies, each of which will receive drones and ammunition, Starlink terminals and other equipment, it said on Facebook. “We are doing everything to provide soldiers with modern technologies.” Starlink is a satellite internet system operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company, and widely used both by civilians and the military in Ukraine. It will take about six months to train Ukrainian pilots for combat in western fighter jets, such as the US’ F-16, Kyiv has said, as it steps up its campaign to secure fourth-generation warplanes. Reuters reports that Ukraine got a huge boost this week when Germany and the US announced plans to provide heavy tanks to Kyiv, which is now hoping the west will also provide long-range missiles and fighter jets. Western military support has been vital for Kyiv and has rapidly evolved. Before the invasion, even the idea of supplying lethal aid to Ukraine was highly controversial, but western supplies have since shattered taboo after taboo. Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuri Ihnat said F-16s may be the best option for a multi-role fighter to replace the country’s current fleet of warplanes, which are older than modern Ukraine itself. He said Kyiv was using four types of Soviet-era planes. The pilots are saying it is not a problem to fly the F-16, they could learn it within several weeks. To fight with these planes is a very different thing, to use all types of weapons. Pilots say they could master it in about half a year. Ukraine uses its warplanes for intercept missions and to attack Russian positions. Germany’s €100bn (£87.7bn, $108bn) special defence fund is no longer enough to cover its needs, the country’s new defence minister Boris Pistorius has said during an interview with Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Pistorius, who took office last week after the resignation of his predecessor, said Germany would also need to raise its annual regular defence spending from the current level of around €50bn. Germany also needs to replenish its military hardware stocks, including replacements for the 14 Leopard tanks that Berlin agreed to send to Ukraine to help repel Russia’s invasion, the new defence chief said. Germany’s decision to suspend compulsory military service in 2011 was a mistake, he added, saying he was hesitant to place a burden upon young generations but was open to discussing a new model to strengthen the relationship between citizens and the state. Asked whether Germany would sent fighter jets to Ukraine, the next request from Kyiv after Germany approved earlier this week the delivery of Leopard 2 tanks, Pistorius said this was “ruled out”. Fighter aircraft are much more complex systems than main battle tanks and have a completely different range and firepower. We would be venture into dimensions that I would currently warn against. Ukraine will need an additional $17bn (£13.7bn) in financing this year for energy repairs, de-mining and to rebuild infrastructure, Reuters quotes the country’s prime minister Denys Shmyhal as saying. He told a government meeting five high-voltage substations in the central, southern and south-west regions were hit during Russia’s air attacks on Thursday. The energy sector has been severely damaged following four months of Russian missile and drones attacks. Shmyhal said the government hosted a meeting with western partners this week to coordinate financial support in a transparent and efficient way. This year, we need to finance a huge budget deficit of about $38bn. Another $17bn this year will be needed for fast reconstruction of the energy, humanitarian de-mining, rebuilding of the housing, critical and social infrastructure. The government also said it was setting up a state agency for infrastructure recovery and development. Mustafa Nayem, a prominent former journalist who had been a deputy infrastructure minister since 2021, would head the newly-created agency. Moscow has ordered Latvia’s envoy to leave Russia within two weeks, the former’s foreign ministry has said – following a similar decision by Riga earlier this week, Reuters reports. The ministry said it had summoned the Latvian chargé d’affaires to protest Riga’s decision to downgrade relations with Russia. Latvia has said it acted out of solidarity with Estonia after Tallinn also ordered out Russia’s envoy. The three Baltic states, which also include Lithuania, have been among a group of Nato allies arguing strongly for more western tanks to be sent to Ukraine. A new barrage of Russian shelling has killed at least 10 Ukrainian civilians and wounded 20 others in a day, the Associated Press (AP) reports, citing the office of Ukraine’s president. Regional officials said towns and villages in the east and in the south that are within reach of the Russian artillery suffered most. Six people died in the Donetsk region, two in Kherson, and two in the Kharkiv region, the AP quotes them as saying. A day earlier, missiles and self-propelled drones that Russian forces fired had hit deeper into Ukrainian territory, killing at least 11 people. Donetsk governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said the Russian military used fiercely-burning phosphorus munitions in its shelling of the village of Zvanivka, about 12 miles (20 km) north of Bakhmut; a city that has become the focus of a gruelling standoff in recent months. The shelling also damaged apartment buildings and two schools in the nearby town of Vuhledar, Kyrylenko said. The governor of the neighbouring Luhansk region Serhii Haidai said Ukrainian shelling hit two Russian bases in the occupied towns of Kreminna and Rubizhne, killing and wounding “dozens” of Russian soldiers. The AP said it could not independently verify his claim. Further south, Russian troops resumed shelling the town of Nikopol, across the river Dnieper from the Russia-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, damaging apartment buildings, gas pipelines, power lines and a bakery, the AP quoted officials as saying. A senior EU official has called for a “Radio Free Russia” to help independent Russian media distribute content in their home country and evade heavy censorship. Vĕra Jourová, the European Commission vice-president in charge of values and transparency, said the EU had a moral duty to support democratic ideals in Russia: We should not give up on the Russian society … regardless of how few or how many want to hear the real news, not Kremlin propaganda. During a speech at Estonia’s foreign ministry, Jourová called for a Radio Free Russia project to support independent Russian media that have been expelled or fled their home country. The project did not mean establishing a new radio station, she said, but supporting journalists in the EU, so they could “produce more content and distribute it more widely without any editorial interference”. She added: We need to create the conditions for them to work and tell the story of the EU they see and experience to their Russian audiences. It is not only a moral duty, it is in our self-interest. Ukraine’s army claims to have killed 109 Russian soldiers and wounded a further 188 in one day during fighting around the village of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk oblast. Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern operational command of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the bloody death toll was recorded on Thursday, adding “Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful.” Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine on top of the 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged, the former’s prime minister has said. Mateusz Morawiecki has told CTV News “we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession.” Belgium has announced a package of an additional €93.6m (£84.5m / $104.7m) in military aid for Ukraine. The prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said that, taking into account previous spending, it amounted to the biggest ever military aid package given to another country by Belgium. The package will include surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, machine guns, grenades and munition. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reported that ten regions of Ukraine are using emergency power outages due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” he added. Lynne Tracy, the new US ambassador to Russia, will not improve ties between Washington and Moscow because the former is engaging in a “hybrid war” against the latter, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Friday. Zakharova said Tracy’s room for manoeuvre would be limited due to what she said was fierce anti-Russian bipartisan feeling in the United States. The European Union wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine, EU justice ministers have said. But the member states differ over how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs. The bloc’s 27 justice ministers met in Stockholm, where they discussed collecting evidence as well as setting up a new international tribunal to prosecute Moscow’s aggression. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukrainian government officials who shirk their duties during wartime will be quickly removed, a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday amid a crack down on corruption. More than a dozen officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief Filippo Grandi has said. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. A 74-year-old Spanish man arrested over a spate of letter bombs sent to institutions including the prime minister’s office and the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid in late 2022 was trying to pressure Spain to drop its support for Ukraine, an investigating magistrate said on Friday.

Belgium has announced a package of an additional €93.6m (£84.5m/$104.7m) in military aid for Ukraine. In a press conference the prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said that, taking into account previous spending, it amounted to the biggest ever military aid package given to another country by Belgium. VRT, the public service broadcaster for Belgium’s Flemish community reports: Federal defence minister Ludivine Dedonder gave details about the nature of the military aid that Belgium is giving to Ukraine. This will include surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, machine guns, grenades and munition. Some of this will come from stocks held by the Belgian army, while the rest will be bought from Belgian arms manufacturers. Dedonder would not go into specific details about the quantities of arms that will be sent. The defence minister went on to say that armoured jeeps and lorries will also be given to the Ukrainians. All of the vehicles that will be sent to Ukraine are all in working order and in a good state of repair or will soon undergo a full service. A 74-year-old Spanish man arrested over a spate of letter bombs sent to institutions including the prime minister’s office and the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid in late 2022 was trying to pressure Spain to drop its support for Ukraine, an investigating magistrate said on Friday. Pompeyo Gonzalez Pascual is under formal investigation over two possible aggravated terrorism charges and four terrorism charges, the magistrate said during his first court hearing. Reuters reports he was ordered to be detained pending any formal charges and further hearings. The suspect used Russian messaging apps such as VK and the Swiss end-to-end encrypted email service Protonmail, which could indicate a risk of him fleeing to Russia, the magistrate added. The evidence suggests Gonzalez acted alone, the judge wrote. He said the suspect’s alleged actions showed his intent to give the impression they were carried out by people with ties with Russia as retribution for Spain’s and the United States’ support for Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion of the country. “There is no indication that the person under investigation belongs to or collaborates with any terrorist gang or organised group,” the statement said. Ukraine’s ruling party has kicked out a lawmaker as reports he travelled to Thailand during the war spark a public outcry. Mykola Tyshchenko was expelled from Servant of the People’s voting bloc after an announcement appeared briefly on the website of the Ukrainian embassy in Thailand saying he would meet members of the diaspora at a hotel there, according to the party’s spokesperson Yulia Paliychuk. Tyshchenko said on Facebook he had been on a business trip in Asia with approval of party leaders, “acting exclusively in the interests of Ukraine”. Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said he had approved no such trip. According to Reuters, the winter visit to south-east Asia came amid a crackdown by the president Volodymyr Zelenskiy aimed at projecting an image of greater accountability for officials. More than a dozen senior officials were fired or resigned this week – including a deputy prosecutor who had come under fire in the press for a holiday in Spain – in the biggest shakeup of the Kyiv leadership since the war began. Zelenskiy has announced a ban this week on private trips abroad by officials. Most Ukrainian men aged 18-60 have already been barred from leaving the country under martial law since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February last year. Ukraine’s army claims to have killed 109 Russian soldiers and wounded a further 188 in one day during fighting around the village of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk oblast. Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern operational command of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the bloody death toll was recorded on Thursday. Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful. The information could not be independently verified. Russia has said its forces have made significant advances in the region in the last six days but UK military intelligence poured doubt on the claims in a briefing on Friday. It was suggested the Russians may have “conducted local, probing attacks” but added that it was “highly unlikely that Russia has actually achieved any substantive advances”. No evidence was provided for the UK military intelligence statement. Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine on top of the 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged, the former’s prime minister has said. Warsaw, which has positioned itself as one of Kyiv’s staunchest allies, has pressed hard for Germany to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and to allow other countries to do so as well; a demand to which Berlin agreed on Wednesday. Now, Mateusz Morawiecki has told CTV News: Poland sent 250 tanks as the first country half a year ago or even more than that. Right now, we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession. Lynne Tracy, the new US ambassador to Russia, will not improve ties between Washington and Moscow because the former is engaging in a “hybrid war” against the latter, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson Maria Zakharova has said. Reuters reports the ambassador’s appointment comes as relations between Russia and the US are at historical lows because of Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Zakharova said Tracy’s room for manoeuvre would be limited due to what she said was fierce anti-Russian bipartisan feeling in the United States. She said she thought it would be progress if US-Russia relations did not sour even further, but said Moscow did not believe it would be possible to prevent a further deterioration. Last week, the Kremlin dismissed the idea that Washington and Moscow could turn their relationship around halfway through the US president Joe Biden’s term in office, adding that there was “no hope” for improvement in the foreseeable future. Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor says it has blocked the websites of the CIA and FBI, accusing the two US government agencies of spreading false information, the state-run Tass news agency reports. In a statement carried by Russian news agencies and relayed by Reuters, it said: Roskomnadzor has restricted access to a number of resources belonging to state structures of hostile countries for disseminating material aimed at destabilising the social and political situation in Russia. Tass quotes Roskomnadzor as saying the two US websites have published inaccurate material and information that had discredited the Russian armed forces. There was no immediate comment from Washington or from the US embassy in Moscow. Reuters noted that the reports were produced in Russia, where the law restricts coverage of the military operations in Ukraine. Russia has made it a criminal offence to discredit its armed forces, a crime punishable by up to five years in jail, while knowingly distributing “false information” about the military carries a maximum sentence of 15 years. Since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February last year, Roskomnadzor has blocked a host of independent media outlets, some foreign news websites and social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. The European Union wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine, EU justice ministers have said. But the member states differ over the methods in a debate about how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs, Reuters reports. The bloc’s 27 justice ministers met in Stockholm ahead of the 24 February anniversary of Russia’s full-scale attack on Ukraine – a former Soviet republic and Moscow satellite that has sought to join the EU and Nato in recent years. Kyiv reports heavy fighting in the east of the country on Friday, capping a week when the west promised to provide Ukraine with modern battlefield tanks for the first time to help it fight back against Moscow. Reuters quotes Ireland’s Simon Harris as saying: There absolutely will have to be accountability for horrific international crimes and the brutality of what we’re seeing in Ukraine ... the clear and apparent war crimes. The ministers discussed collecting evidence as well as setting up a new international tribunal to prosecute Moscow’s aggression. Gunnar Strommer, Sweden’s justice minister, said: Nobody doing this kind of war crimes shall go free. It’s very, very important that we will find a way to hold responsible people accountable. The question is, how can we deal with this in a practical and efficient way. As the 27 EU countries debated the options, the Slovak minister spoke against starting a new body to carry out prosecutions, something his Belgian colleague Vincent van Quickenborne specifically called for. The latter was quoted as saying: These acts of aggression should be condemned not only by European countries or by the United States, but by a large majority of countries ... in Africa, Latin America and other places. The European Union hopes South Africa will use its good relations with Russia to convince it to stop the war in Ukraine, Reuters quotes the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell as saying. Speaking alongside South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, in the capital Pretoria, he told reporters: The EU isn’t asking South Africa to choose sides, just asking countries across the world to stand with the UN charter. The EU considers South Africa an important partner in the rules-based international order, he added. Pandor said: It is not just South Africa and other African countries that must play a role at seeking peace. The German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has repeatedly sought to make clear that Nato must not become party to the war in Ukraine, says a ministry spokesperson, in response to uproar over a comment she made earlier in the week about fighting against Russia. At an event in Strasbourg on Tuesday, Baerbock said in English: “We are fighting a war against Russia, and not against each other.” Now, Reuters quotes the German ministry as saying: Russian propaganda continually takes statements, sentences, stances, positions of the government, our partners and uses them to serve their purposes. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has met the Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, during a tour of African nations to shore up support for Russia, focusing on the “dynamics of the war in Ukraine”, Eritrea’s information minister has said. Lavrov has been on a week-long charm offensive on the continent, starting in South Africa, which is planning joint military drills with Russia and China, and finishing off with a surprise trip to the reclusive Horn of Africa nation of Eritrea. South Africa is one of Russia’s most important allies on a continent divided over the invasion and western attempts to isolate Moscow because of its military actions. Eritrea is one of the few African countries that voted against a UN resolution condemning Russia’s 24 February invasion of Ukraine; although many abstained. hee Russian state news agency Tass quotes Lavrov as saying: We are thankful to Eritrean friends for their consistent support of Russian initiatives in the UN. He said Asmara had taken a “principled and balanced position on issues regarding the events in Ukraine and around it”, TASS reports, adding that he also invited his Eritrean counterpart, Osman Saleh, to visit Moscow soon. The talks in Eritrea also explored ways of enhancing ties in energy, mining, information technology, education and health, the information minister Yemane Meskel says. Both sides will conduct a joint study to establish the logistical and transit opportunities presented by the Red Sea port of Massawa and its airport, Tass reports, quoting Lavrov as saying: I would like to mention the possibility of using the logistical potential of the Massawa port and the city’s airport. The airport of Massawa looks interesting from the point of view of its transit possibilities. Lavrov’s visit to Africa coincides with others by senior US officials, who are crisscrossing the continent to shore up ties with its allies there. Speaking when he met Lavrov’s delegation on Thursday, the foreign minister Osman blamed the crisis in Ukraine on what he described as the United States’ “reckless policy of hegemony and containment” over several decades, Reuters reports. The sad fact is that Ukraine is both a pretext and victim of this policy. There was no mention of the conflict in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, where Eritrean troops fought alongside their Ethiopian federal counterparts against rebellious Tigrayan forces. A deal to end the fighting was signed last November but Eritrea was not party to the truce. Eritrean troops have started to leave some parts of Tigray, witnesses said. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reported that 10 regions of Ukraine are using emergency power due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. Ukrainian civilians had raced for cover on Thursday as Russia fired a barrage of missiles and drones across the country, killing at least 11 people, a day after Kyiv won pledges of battlefield tanks to combat Moscow’s invasion from western countries. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” he added. Ukrainian government officials who shirk their duties during wartime will be quickly removed, a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday amid a crack down on corruption. More than a dozen officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief Filippo Grandi has said. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. “This is something that is happening in Russia and must not happen,” he added. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. Tass is reporting that the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are to be ordered to use Moscow time instead of Kyiv time. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukraine has called on the 27-nation EU to include Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom in sanctions but Hungary, which has a Russian-built nuclear plant it plans to expand with Rosatom, has blocked that. Reuters reports that Orbán reiterated in an interview that sanctions on nuclear energy “must obviously be vetoed”. “We will not allow the plan to include nuclear energy into the sanctions be implemented,” the Hungarian premier said. “This is out of the question.” Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said. Plans by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to look at ways for those athletes to return to international competition would be opposed, the minister, Vadim Guttsait, said on social media late on Thursday. “Our position is unchanged: as long as there is a war in Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian athletes should not be in international competitions,” Guttsait wrote on his Facebook page. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Kevin Rawlinson will be with you for the next few hours. Ukraine’s Marta Kostyuk said on Friday it “hurts a lot” to see Russian flags at the Australian Open despite the ban on them and was surprised by the lapse in security that allowed spectators to display the flags in and around Melbourne Park. Novak Djokovic’s father, Srdjan, said earlier on Friday he would not attend his son’s semi-final against Tommy Paul after a video emerged showing him posing at Melbourne Park with fans holding Russian flags. “It hurts a lot because there were specific rules, they were printed out outside that this is not allowed to bring flags,” Reuters reports Kostyuk told reporters after bowing out of the women’s doubles competition with Elena-Gabriela Ruse. “It’s not impossible, but you’re not allowed to bring out the flags and so on. It really hurts that they were there for quite some time. “They were there on the court, in the stands as well and I just don’t understand as well. It really hurts and I don’t understand how this can be possible.” Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief told Reuters in an interview. Speaking at the UNHCR offices in Kyiv following a six-day tour of the country, Filippo Grandi said Ukraine’s president had asked his agency to “do more” to help children from occupied regions to whom this was happening. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. “This is something that is happening in Russia and must not happen,” he added. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. “We are seeking access all the time, and access has been rather rare, sporadic and not unfettered, if you see what I mean.” Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. “We categorically reject unfounded allegations that the Russian authorities are kidnapping children,” Russian diplomat at the United Nations Dmitry Polyansky said in July. Tass is reporting that the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are to be ordered to use Moscow time instead of Kyiv time. It writes: According to the official Telegram channel of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation “Step-by-step synchronisation of Russian legislation continues after the admission of four new entities to it. In the near future, the Dontesk People’s Republic, Luhansk People’s Republic, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions will become part of the second time zone, where Moscow time operates,” the message says. The relevant bill has already been submitted to the government of the Russian Federation. “Recall that earlier all four regions lived according to Kyiv time, UTC + 2 (one hour less than in Moscow) and UTC + 3 in the summer. Currently, Moscow time de facto operates in the new regions, and the new bill fixes this. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” Reuters reports he added. Here are some images of people ice fishing in Ukraine’s occupied region of Luhansk, which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne has reported on the latest energy situation. It writes on its official Telegram channel: Currently, ten regions of Ukraine are already using emergency power outages due to a power shortage in the network after yesterday’s Russian shelling, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said. Plans by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to look at ways for those athletes to return to international competition would be opposed, the minister, Vadim Guttsait, said on social media late on Thursday, Reuters reports. “Our position is unchanged: as long as there is a war in Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian athletes should not be in international competitions,” Guttsait wrote on his Facebook page. “Work is currently underway on further possible steps and first steps to continue sanctions and prevent Russians and Belarusians from international competitions,” he said. “If we are not heard, I do not rule out the possibility that we will boycott and refuse participation in the Olympics.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted a message to his official Telegram channel on Holocaust Memorial day. 27 January marks the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. In the message, Ukraine’s president writes: Today, as always, Ukraine honors the memory of millions of victims of the Holocaust. We know and remember that indifference kills along with hatred. Indifference and hatred are always capable of creating evil together only. That is why it is so important that everyone who values life should show determination when it comes to saving those whom hatred seeks to destroy. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Stefano Sannino, secretary general of the European Union’s European external action service, has defended German and US provisions of military equipment to Ukraine, and criticised Russia’s President Vladimir Putin for waging a war on Nato and the west. Associated Press report that Sannino, speaking at a news conference in Tokyo as part of an Asia-Pacific tour, said Putin had “moved from a concept of special operation to a concept now of a war against Nato and the west.” He said German and US tank provisions are meant to help Ukrainians defend themselves in the war, rather than making them attackers. “I think that this latest development in terms of armed supply is just an evolution of the situation and of the way Russia started moving the war into a different stage,” Sannino said. He added that Russia is making “indiscriminate attacks” on civilians and cities and no longer military targets. The EU is not moving the war into a different stage but is “just giving the possibility of saving lives and allowing the Ukrainians to defend from these barbaric attacks,” Sannino said. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukraine has called on the 27-nation EU to include Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom in sanctions but Hungary, which has a Russian-built nuclear plant it plans to expand with Rosatom, has blocked that. Reuters reports that Orbán reiterated in an interview that sanctions on nuclear energy “must obviously be vetoed”. “We will not allow the plan to include nuclear energy into the sanctions be implemented,” the Hungarian premier said. “This is out of the question.” Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne reports that the night passed in Sumy region without any shelling. The UK’s ministry of defence has published its latest intelligence briefing on how it sees the situation in Ukraine. It casts doubt on recent Russian claims of military advances in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk, writing: Over the last six days, Russian online commentators have claimed Russian forces have made significant advances, breaking through Ukrainian defences in two areas: in Zaporizhzhia Oblast near Orikiv, and 100km to the east, in Donetsk Oblast, near Vuhledar. Russian units have probably conducted local, probing attacks near Orikiv and Vuhledar, but it is highly unlikely that Russia has actually achieved any substantive advances. There is a realistic possibility that Russian military sources are deliberately spreading misinformation in an effort to imply that the Russian operation is sustaining momentum. The claim is presented on social media without any supporting evidence being published. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. I will be with you for the next few hours. Oleskandr Musiyenko, head of the Military and Strategic Research Centre of Ukraine, says Russia is sending in more reinforcements to block Ukrainian advances. “They are mostly sending infantry and artillery forces into battle, made up mainly of conscripts. But they do not have the level of artillery and tank support they had on Feb. 24,” Musiyenko said in an interview with Ukrainian television. “They have fewer resources. They are relying on the numerical superiority of their troops.” Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese on Friday reiterated Australian support for Ukraine and criticised supporters of Russia’s invasion after a video emerged showing Novak Djokovic’s father posing at the Australian Open with fans holding Russian flags, Reuters reports. Police questioned four fans seen with “inappropriate flags and symbols” after a quarter-final match on Wednesday between Russia’s Andrey Rublev and favourite Djokovic, organisers Tennis Australia said. “I will make this point, that Australia stands with the people of Ukraine. That is Australia’s position and Australia is unequivocal in our support for the rule of international law,” Albanese told a news conference after a reporter asked if Djokovic’s father, Srdjan, should be deported after he was seen posing for pictures with fans holding Russian flags. “We do not want to see any support given to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, that is having a devastating impact on the people of Ukraine.” Albanese did not respond directly to the question about whether Srdjan Djokovic should be deported. Djokovic’s father could not be reached for comment by Reuters. An adviser to president Zelenskiy has issued a warning to fellow Ukrainian officials which appears to be related to the ongoing drive to stamp out corruption. More than a dozen Ukrainian officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. “Everyone should understand their level of responsibility to the country and nation during the war. Whoever forgets about it receives a quick reaction,” said Andriy Yermak, head of Zelenskiy’s office. “This will happen to everyone who allows themselves to forget (their duties), regardless of names and offices,” Yermak wrote on Twitter. Among the most high-profile cases was that of a deputy defence minister who resigned following a report, which he denied, that his ministry paid inflated prices to feed troops. A presidential adviser who had been called out by local media for driving flashy cars also quit, as did a senior prosecutor who Ukrainian media reported had gone on holiday to Marbella in Spain, flouting martial law. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. But Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the head of Rosenergoatom, the company operating Russia’s nuclear plants, said the comments were unfounded and called it a “provocation”. Russia has in the past reacted to Ukrainian successes with massed airstrikes that left millions without light, heat or water. On Thursday, it appeared to follow that pattern. Prime minister Denys Shmyhal said Russia’s attacks targeted energy plants. “I held an urgent meeting today about the energy situation – about the shortages that are occurring and repair work after the terrorists’ strikes. Repair teams are working in those sites,” Zelenskiy said on Thursday. The Kremlin said it saw the promised delivery of western tanks as evidence of growing “direct involvement” of the United States and Europe in the 11-month-old war, something both deny. In his nightly address following Thursday’s deadly missile strikes across, Zelenskiy called for further sanctions on Russia and for allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons. Ukrainian civilians raced for cover on Thursday as Russia fired a barrage of missiles and drones across the country, killing at least 11 people, a day after Kyiv won pledges of battlefield tanks to combat Moscow’s invasion from western countries. Zelenskiy said: This Russian aggression can and should be stopped only with adequate weapons. The terrorist state will not understand anything else. Weapons on the battlefield. Weapons that protect our skies. New sanctions against Russia, i.e. political and economic weapons. And legal weapons - we need to work even harder to establish a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments as they happen. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for further sanctions on Russia and more weapons for Ukraine, after Russian strikes on Thursday left 11 dead and 11 wounded. We’ll have more from Zelenskiy’s latest address shortly. In the meantime here are the other key recent developments: Ukrainian civilians raced for cover on Thursday as Russia fired a barrage of missiles and drones across the country, killing at least 11 people, a day after Kyiv won pledges of battlefield tanks to combat Moscow’s invasion from western countries. Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych criticised the International Olympic Committee on Thursday for considering allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to international competitions. Russia’s finance ministry has proposed scrapping liquidity restrictions for spending on “anti-crisis” investments from its national wealth fund (NWF), citing the need to support key sectors amid challenging geopolitical conditions. The UK hopes the Challenger 2 tanks it is supplying to Ukraine will arrive in the country at the end of March, defence department minister Alex Chalk said on Thursday. Russian authorities designated the independent news outlet Meduza an “undesirable organisation” on Thursday, effectively outlawing the site from operating in Russia and banning any Russian from cooperating with Meduza or its journalists. The Ukrainian central bank’s foreign currency reserves will stand at about $30bn at the end of January, Yuri Heletiy, the deputy governor told reporters on Thursday, according to Reuters. The arrest of a high-ranking Ukrainian intelligence agent accused of spying for Russia has highlighted the urgent need for a cleanout of the country’s key security service, a former deputy head of the agency has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
