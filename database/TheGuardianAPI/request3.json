But Bristol-Myers Squibb's move, which will transform its products from a niche market to a need market for the millions of people who could never have afforded them before, highlights the way in which forward-thinking multinational companies (MNCs) are now targeting the 4 billion people, two-thirds of the Earth's population, who have until now been written off in terms of market potential. Stuart Hart, director of the Sustainable Enterprise Initiative at the University of North Carolina, says it is not surprising that companies have traditionally overlooked the rural poor - what he calls the 'bottom of the pyramid' - as a fertile market. 'The bottom of the pyramid is chaotic and almost totally lacking in infrastructure. Not only that, to buy products and services - one must have money - and these people have little.' He defines the bottom of the pyramid as people with per capita incomes of less than $1,500 a year. But companies are beginning to dip their toes into these turbid waters. Shell Solar, in a joint venture with South Africa's national power company, Eskom, is bringing affordable solar power to the impoverished and isolated communities of the Eastern Cape for the first time, and with it the first social development many of them have ever experienced. But this is a strictly for-profit business. Shell Solar also operates in Sri Lanka, India, and the Philippines, and has ambitions to break into the mass markets of China and Indonesia. Dupont, Unilever, Hewlett-Packard and Johnson &amp; Johnson have also recently been experimenting with rural poor markets. Hart predicts that in five years' time this toe-dipping will develop into a substantial element of companies' global strategy. 'It's clear to many multinationals that if they are to grow and prosper in the future there isn't growth potential at the top of the pyramid,' he said in an interview. 'It's also increasingly evident, as a result of the pushback against globalisation, that the traditional business model won't be acceptable in the future.' Unlike with newly industrialising markets such as Malaysia or Thailand, where MNCs could make small adjustments to the business models they use in Europe or North America before jumping in with both feet, reaching the rural poor involves throwing out the rulebook and rewriting it on the ground - often in close partnership with local companies or non-governmental organisations. The MNC furthest along this track is Unilever which, under the chairmanship of Niall FitzGerald, has espoused a multi-local, multinational approach across all its operations. Nowhere has this worked more successfully than in India, where its subsidiary Hindustan Lever is, as FitzGerald says, 'totally integrated into Indian society and dedicated to meeting the specific needs of millions of Indian consumers'. It wasn't always thus. For 50 years, like most multinationals in India, Hindustan Lever catered to India's elite. But when a low-end local company, Nirma, began to threaten Hindustan Lever's detergents business from below, it had to drastically rewrite its business plan. In order to offer a cheaper product, in small individual packaging, through the thousand tiny outlets where poor people shop, it had to decentralise its production, marketing and distribution to take advantage of India's abundant labour pool and change its cost structure. Its margins were lower, but this was more than compensated for by soaring unit sales. For a rupee or two, Indians can now buy shampoo in single sachets, handcream in pots the size of a thimble and toothpaste in small disposable sachets. Single rupee sachets comprise about 70 per cent of the company's shampoo sales. It's a business model that Unilever was able to replicate when the Asian economic crisis brought hardship to the newly industrialising south-east Asian countries. 'When South East Asia was hitting economic difficulties, we were able to adapt by tailor-making smaller-quantity products for those markets, says a Unilever spokesman. 'We came out the other side of the crisis stronger.' One of the reasons why the very poor are becoming a market is that more and more now have access to credit. Microcredit, the lending by banks of tiny sums to the poor, is catching on all over the world, particularly in the sub-continent. An estimated 2 million families in India have access to financial services, and the Indian government has pledged to reach 25 million families by 2005. In Bangladesh, Grameen Bank, the oldest and most successful microcredit institution, with 2.5 million borrowers, has spun off into a host of other enterprises providing services to the poor, including GrameenPhone, which is 51 per cent owned by Telenor Invest AS of Norway and aims to finance a network of mobile phones in 68,000 rural villages. Damien Miller, Shell Solar's business manager for India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines, says partnership with a micro-credit organisation is a prerequisite to entering a market, for it is only through credit that someone earning $1,000-$2,000 a year can afford the $500 energy system. 'There has to be capacity to pay. You can get to a lot of paddy farmers who can give a down payment of 20 per cent and pay the rest over five years.' But isn't there a risk of people taking on debt they cannot sustain? In Sri Lanka, he says, the repayment rate is 95 per cent. More importantly, solar panels are a good investment for customers, who would otherwise use kerosene or rechargeable batteries for electricity. Economic payback ranges from two to five years - compared with a 20-year payback in countries such as the Netherlands and Germany, where solar energy remains a niche market. 'There [in the West] they are doing it for environmental reasons,' says Miller. 'In developing countries it's a need market. They really need your product.' But not all companies operate so responsibly. One has only to look at Nestlé, which pedalled its dried baby milk formula to Third World mothers who had no access to clean drinking water as the 'healthy' alternative to breast milk, to see what harm can be done by irresponsible corporate behaviour. Hart acknowledges the risk of exploitation, but says that with the rise of the internet and the global power of pressure groups, companies won't get away with socially irresponsible behaviour for long. 'I'm sure there will be plenty of mistakes, but I'm also confident they'll be ferreted out quickly. Increasingly we live in a fishbowl.' Hart instead sees the developing world as an incubator for sustainable technologies of the future - providing an early market 'pull' for ideas that will one day replace entrenched but ultimately unsustainable technologies in Europe and North America, such as fossil fuels. He points to micropower technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines and solar power, which have found early markets in places such as India. Some villages in Africa will soon have access to solar powered multi-media modems that will be enable them to access the internet. 'This extends far beyond good PR and corporate social responsibility,' he says. 'MNCs are acting from enlightened self-interest.' terry.slavin@observer.co.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2001/mar/09/guardianletters3","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2001-03-09T02:27:18Z","webTitle":"Letters: Pidgeons and a duck","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/mar/09/guardianletters3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2001/mar/09/guardianletters3","fields":{"headline":"Pigeons and a duck","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Perhaps Ken Livingstone could purchase the Sky Mirror sculpture from Nottingham Playhouse (Letters, March 8) and site it on Nelson's column?

The Jessica had been on its way to refuel the very same Explorer II when it struck rocks last month and regurgitated its filthy load into this priceless marine paradise. This was the first trip by the Explorer II since the accident. For tourists visiting the area there is no sign of oily waters, black beaches or dead wildlife. Conservationists estimate just one pelican perished, while several sea lions and 100 birds had to be rescued from the oil and cleaned up. Millions of invertebrates at the bottom of the fragile food chain were destroyed and the marine iguanas' food source of algae was contaminated. The near catastrophe has raised questions about ecotourism in this supposedly pristine marine reserve. The debate is particularly pertinent for Ecuador which contains part of the stunning Andes mountain chain and is blessed with ownership of the Galapagos Islands as well as a large chunk of virgin rainforest at the top of the Amazon basin. The passengers on board the Explorer II earlier this month spoke of their relief at arriving to find clean seas. Quiet relief turned to excitement as they caught the first glimpse of the islands' unique creatures. Blue-footed boobies flew within feet of the dinghies, while pelicans skimmed heads as they dived like combat aircraft into shallow water in search of fish. People tripped over sleeping sea lions on the curved white beach and had close encounters with others staring into their masks while out snorkelling. Lurid green and red marine iguanas basked on rocks like prehistoric statues while visitors snapped away on their cameras. The Galapagos's animals are famously fearless of humans. Only the bright orange ghost crabs ran away: they are one of the few creatures in this isolated archipelago that have natural enemies. On Genovesa, just to the north of the Equator , groups from the Explorer II climbed the steep laval outcrops to find hundreds of masked boobies whistling their haunting mating calls to the sky, and frigate birds puffing out their red chest pouches. The unique giant tortoises that helped inspire Charles Darwin's breakthrough work on evolution in 1859, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , were to be seen in the captive breeding programmes at the Charles Darwin station on Santa Cruz island or, in a more natural setting, up in the hills nearby, where they creep freely through the trees. A short woodland trail ends suddenly in a vast lagoon, where the tortoises paddle in slow motion surrounded by huge ferns in a scene straight out of Jurassic Park . Unfortunately, on this particular expedition, the tour bus bumped into one of the giant creatures blocking the track. The guide jumped down from the bus and heaved the tortoise by its shell on to the verge. And this is where the foundations of ecotourism start to look a bit shaky. Despite warnings from nature guides not to disturb anything at all, one passenger snapped her fingers at preening birds to get a good camera shot; another pocketed a crab shell; one hugged a tortoise; and there was frequent spillage of suncream, which harms the coral and seals. Meanwhile, the ship itself makes much of its use of biodegradable soaps, while its engine uses a vile mix of diesel and so-called bunker - a heavier, low-grade fuel - and its 105-passenger capacity makes it the largest of the 82 cruise ships allowed here. With sealed window cabins and 24-hour air conditioning, it con stantly pumps black smoke from its funnels and admits to dumping the contents of its toilets out at sea in the dead of night. The Explorer II's expedition leader and naturalist guide Billy Chiquito said: 'In the beginning, tour boats had saltwater showers and no air conditioning, but tourists demand more luxury. It would cost a lot to convert our engine but we are looking at putting electric engines on the dinghies.' Annual tourist limits in the Galapagos have soared in the last five years from 45,000 to 70,000, and the mostly fifty-something visitors fly in on 30-year-old jets. Chiquito said that only 8 per cent of the 4,500 square mile land mass of the islands is accessible to tourists on controlled itineraries, while only 3 per cent of the land is inhabited. Tourists' main contribution to the region is the $100 compulsory visitor tax paid by each one. Chiquito complained that most of the money was siphoned off by the Ecuadorian government. But Jennifer Stone, of the London-based Galapagos Conservation Trust, which is linked to the Charles Darwin Foundation, said she was confident, since the rules were tightened up in 1998, that 95 per cent of the tax reaches the islands. Stone and other conservationists believe the Galapagos environment is less under threat from tourism than from the fishing industry, the invasion of 'alien' species, such as goats, horses and rats, and the permanent community of 16,000 Galapagos residents. One local guide said: 'There are little oil spills and diesel dumping from cruise boats and fishing boats around here all the time - but they never tell you about that.' Oil may be a dirty word in the Galapagos but it is regarded as black gold on the mainland, where it is the chief earner of export revenues since Texaco struck rich reserves in the north-east of Ecuador in the Seventies. Vast areas of jungle and the culture of many indigenous communities have been destroyed in the pursuit of wealth - a familiar story across the Amazon. Now several oil companies from North America and Europe are closing in on the glorious rainforest in the south-east of Ecuador, where nature and the blow-gun hunting lifestyle of the Shuar and Achuar indigenous people have remained relatively untouched. In the heart of this region on the Peruvian border and at least 20 days' walk from the nearest town is the Kapawi Eco Lodge, a tourism venture created in a pact between the Achuar community and the same Ecuadorian business venture, Canodros, that owns the Explorer II cruise ship. Up to 40 tourists a time are flown in on tiny planes, landing on mud air strips. The Kapawi lodge runs on solar energy, log cabins (built with wooden nails) and rules of one five-minute shower for each person a day under dim lighting. The lack of concrete, Tarmac and mechanical noise is a tonic, the air instead being filled with the sounds of whooping birds, cicadas and howler monkeys, and the scent of steamy undergrowth. Visitors can go kayaking, camping, bird and alligator-watching and, most controversially, visiting Achuar villages, which elicited mixed reactions, with some groups loving it, others squirming at the intrusion. The main activity, though, is forest treks, with an English-speaking Ecuadorian and an Achuar guide. But hasn't the replacement of nudity with jeans and T-shirts and the arrival of aeroplanes, Christianity, school and dollar-wielding tourists blighted the character and culture of the rainforest? Achuar workers at Kapawi argue that leaving everything in the rainforest untouched is not an option. Some want to travel to the capital Quito or abroad to work and study. Others want to stay in the forest living traditionally in huts but with access to schools and air evacuation for medical treatment. That means dollars, which means saying yes to oil, logging or tourists. It took a year of intense negotiations before the Finae, the representative body of the 80,000-strong Achuar community, agreed to admit Kapawi in 1994, on the basis that lower-impact, lucrative tourism is the lesser of the evils. Kapawi pays the Achuar $2,000 a month and has a deal to hand over ownership of the lodge to them entirely in 2011. But all the time, the oil companies, with the Ecuadorian government's blessing, visit the Finae and offer them untold billions to let them tear up the forest. Senior Achuar guide and community leader Irar Washike, said the pressure from the oil industry was immense. 'But we have heard what has happened in the north and we will not let them build roads and bring contamination here,' he said. He believes that projects such as Kapawi are conservationist and he is desperate for the Finae to resist selling out to Big Oil. 'Most Achuar feel the same about this. Even if it was my own brother who got bribed, I would kill him to stop the oil companies getting in here.' Many believe the concept of ecotourism is at best a complex solution in a consumers' world, at worst an oxymoron. The dilemma is keenly felt in a country as vivid but fragile as tiny Ecuador. Back on board the Explorer II, one of the local naturalists remarked ruefully that the Jessica accident was an early warning of what could happen if Ecuador was careless with its priceless inheritance. 'But we haven't done so badly, despite being a poor country,' he remarked. 'If America or Europe owned the Galapagos islands or our rainforest I believe they would be covered in Holiday Inns and freeways by now.'

There is sadness for the wreck of his country under a regime which has driven him out and destroyed the university he was proud of.

They were being interviewed in Pakistan that day by the British High Commission about a visa. \"My mind is not here,\" he apologises. The professor of engineering from Kabul is one of 27 people now being helped by the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara), a body which started in 1933 to help Jews and other victims of the Nazi purge of universities. The formation of what was then called the Academic Assistance Council was kick-started by a tumultuous meeting at the Albert Hall addressed by Albert Einstein. Today the centres of persecution have shifted via South Africa and Latin America to Iraq, Sudan, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Somalia, but the job of helping university teachers and researchers to pick themselves up after persecution and establish themselves in this country remains the same. The climate of hatred and distrust of asylum seekers is perhaps even worse than in the 1930s, although over the years Britain's reward for sheltering scholars has been out of all proportion to the tiny investment - 18 Nobel prizewinners, 71 fellows of the Royal Society, 50 fellows of the British Academy. The council campaigns on refugee issues and criticises what it sees as the worst excesses of government policy, such as the demeaning vouchers system. Its president, Sir Raymond Hoffenberg, who himself was a political exile from South Africa, has attacked the \"wholly unacceptable\" Immigration and Asylum Act and the current wave of bigotry at a time of unprecedented prosperity: \"It is difficult to imagine the implications for the UK and the world had Karl Popper or Max Perutz - two of the scholars we supported - been dealt with in the demeaning way envisaged by the current legislation: in isolation from other scholars, dumped far from cen tres of learning and forced to live on benefits provided by vouchers.\" But most of the council's work is practical: advice about the labyrinthine asylum and social security regulations, making contact with university departments where they might be welcome, small grants for fees and travel. Cara limits its scope to helping genuine academics but even for this small section of the overall refugee population it could do a lot more if it had more funds. Professor Lalzad's case is typical. A specialist in thermal engineering with a Russian masters degree, he taught in the department of mechanical engineering at Kabul University. He had five textbooks and more than 30 published articles to his credit and had held senior university positions. When the victorious Taliban closed the university, he worked for the Red Cross, in charge of distributing thousands of tonnes of food to 40,000 widows and disabled people. He was arrested, beaten with Kalashnikovs and thrown in prison on suspicion of giving information to anti-Taliban forces. The influence of the Red Cross got him released, but his life was in danger and he fled to Pakistan, where his wife and children were eventually able to follow. He arrived at Heathrow in December 1998, to be grilled for hours by immigration officials who believed he was Pakistani because his English was so good. (It was the medium of instruction in his department.) Lalzad concedes that Pakistanis do try to enter the UK by claiming to be Afghan refugees, and is sure he would have been deported had he not produced his Red Cross identity card. Then came a frustrating wait while his application for asylum was considered (it took 18 months) and he tried to get work. \"I felt ashamed sitting at home. It is a morally bad way of living for someone with education and knowledge not to work.\" Letters to universities produced no result, though he was encouraged by a short course at the University of North London, where he made contacts.

At the moment he is doing mathematical modelling with the aim of building an experimental model of a solar-powered desalination plant. Desalination technology is well advanced in the oil-rich Middle East states, but across a wide zone of northern Asia, the Middle East and North Africa there is a pressing need for small, cheap plants. The goal is a gadget consisting of a small box and a condenser. \"I hope it will be a very low cost and efficient technique for desalinating water that can be used in poor developing countries, especially where they have a lot of solar energy.\" He hopes to be able to resume teaching at his new university. Meanwhile he waits for news of his family. The potential benefits of Professor Lalzad's research are obvious. John Akker, secretary of Cara, says his case is repeated many times over among the academics on their books. There is the Iraqi paediatrician, a consultant at Salahaddin University, forced to leave because of the help he gave to the Kurdish population. He has been given small grants for books and fees to enable him to pass the level of English that would allow him to practise in this country. Another Iraqi doctor is currently doing medical research at Manchester, while a bacteriologist identified only as Ms L is doing a PhD at Brighton University. Also receiving grants from the council are academics from Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda and Sierra Leon, and a Chinese economist who suffered long-running harassment and was dismissed from his university post after taking part in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. He is now doing an English course to enable him to pursue a masters. Until the council paid for travel expenses (£697 last year) he was walking ten miles to college. Yet he has not left all harassment behind: now it's racial. Akker is angered by current hysteria against asylum seekers, and worried by Home Secretary Jack Straw's proposals to process applications in neighbouring countries: \"These people are seen as scroungers living off the state, but they want to contribute here actively, and want to go back to their countries to change the things that brought them here in the first place.\" Cara: giving hope when hope has fled Albie Sachs, an academic who became a judge in South Africa's constitutional court, was twice helped by Cara's predecessor body, the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning - once when he fled the apartheid regime in 1966 and then again when he was nearly killed by a bomb in Mozambique. In a lecture he expressed his warm feelings for the body and its quiet unobtrusive work. \"It is not one of those bodies which takes out adverts in the bottom right hand of the front page of the Guardian,\" he told his audience in London in 1997. \"It was people helping people in need simply because they were in trouble, because they got into trouble because they were trying to do research in an intolerant society where persecution became the name of the game.\" This altruism did have enormous benefits to Britain in the contributions these outsiders made in teaching and research, and the effects did not stop there, he said. \"When the causes of persecution have been removed and we go back to our countries, we take so much of Britain with us. The positive and negative lessons which we learnt here. The things to avoid, the mistakes that are made, the good things that are done, and we help to rebuild our own countries and to develop democracy, science and learning and culture.\" Sachs listed a series of ministers in the first post-apartheid government in South Africa who had spent time in Britain, from Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela's successor, who has an MA in economics from Sussex, to finance minister Gill Marcus, who set up a sandwich kiosk in Holborn, London, while in exile, and Frene Ginwala, speaker of the South African parliament. There might be spin-offs for Britain, he added, \"but what really matters is that some things are good in themselves, they do not need extra justification.\" The council is launching an appeal this spring.

There is the Iraqi paediatrician, a consultant at Salahaddin University, forced to leave because of the help he gave to the Kurdish population. He has been given small grants for books and fees to enable him to pass the level of English that would allow him to practise in this country. Another Iraqi doctor is currently doing medical research at Manchester, while a bacteriologist identified only as Ms L is doing a PhD at Brighton University. Also receiving grants from the council are academics from Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda and Sierra Leon, and a Chinese economist who suffered long-running harassment and was dismissed from his university post after taking part in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. He is now doing an English course to enable him to pursue a masters. Until the council paid for travel expenses (£697 last year) he was walking ten miles to college. Yet he has not left all harassment behind: now it's racial. Akker is angered by current hysteria against asylum seekers, and worried by Home Secretary Jack Straw's proposals to process applications in neighbouring countries: \"These people are seen as scroungers living off the state, but they want to contribute here actively, and want to go back to their countries to change the things that brought them here in the first place.\" Cara: giving hope when hope has fled Albie Sachs, an academic who became a judge in South Africa's constitutional court, was twice helped by Cara's predecessor body, the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning - once when he fled the apartheid regime in 1966 and then again when he was nearly killed by a bomb in Mozambique. In a lecture he expressed his warm feelings for the body and its quiet unobtrusive work. \"It is not one of those bodies which takes out adverts in the bottom right hand of the front page of the Guardian,\" he told his audience in London in 1997. \"It was people helping people in need simply because they were in trouble, because they got into trouble because they were trying to do research in an intolerant society where persecution became the name of the game.\" This altruism did have enormous benefits to Britain in the contributions these outsiders made in teaching and research, and the effects did not stop there, he said. \"When the causes of persecution have been removed and we go back to our countries, we take so much of Britain with us. The positive and negative lessons which we learnt here. The things to avoid, the mistakes that are made, the good things that are done, and we help to rebuild our own countries and to develop democracy, science and learning and culture.\" Sachs listed a series of ministers in the first post-apartheid government in South Africa who had spent time in Britain, from Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela's successor, who has an MA in economics from Sussex, to finance minister Gill Marcus, who set up a sandwich kiosk in Holborn, London, while in exile, and Frene Ginwala, speaker of the South African parliament. There might be spin-offs for Britain, he added, \"but what really matters is that some things are good in themselves, they do not need extra justification.\" The council is launching an appeal this spring.

To control and reduce the threat requires that the planet as a whole balances its use of fossil fuel as a source of energy with the ability of the planet to safely absorb the byproducts. Solar energy provides about 1,000 times as much energy as the fossil energy used at present and 170 times as much as would be required to maintain all at the same level of consumption as the developed nations. The sensible way is to introduce a UN-managed world wide levy, at source, on the extraction of primary energy products. A levy of 10p per kilowatt-hour would result in fossil energy costing six times as much as renewable forms of energy. The market would then ensure massive research and development of renewable sources. As fossil fuel use is gradually switched to renewable use, the levy would be increased to make replacement even more financially attractive and to conserve the diminishing fossil stocks. This international income, disbursed by the UN, would allow each nation to abolish all forms of taxation which increase the cost of labour. With tax barriers removed, each nation's economy would be able to benefit from the release of the ingenuity and creativity of its own citizens. Of course it won't happen because it requires cooperation between nations and leaders.

Woke up dreaming that I was lying on a beach in California: now I know that I'm not. For 45 minutes, the discussion is a genteel digest of various books Paxman's guests have written. Then, abruptly, the mood darkens as the presenter introduces Professor Kevin Warwick of the Cybernetics Department at Reading University. His tone is terse as he describes how Warwick had an operation to insert a small remote sensor into his arm, which was then linked to his computer, and how next year he plans to have another implant connected to his central nervous system, potentially enabling the machine to interact with his body, to send and receive instructions as a kind of surrogate brain. Warwick's fellow guests discuss some of the alarming issues raised by his work, but Paxman seems thrown. He can't believe what he's hearing. 'Well,' he tells them at the end, 'you're all either credulous or I'm... I'm benighted somehow.' The toaster clangs off and I find myself smiling. A few months ago, this stuff sounded like science fiction to me, too. The Intel building looms inscrutable white in the perfect Silicon Valley sun, just off Highway 101 at Santa Clara, near San José. Gathered around it is a leafy campus, through which a few of the 6,000 staff stride in short sleeves and skirts. It is pleasant, but almost freakishly undramatic in presentation and appearance; like the suburban, Stepford-wife sprawl of the Valley as a whole, in fact. It takes an effort to remember that decisions taken here will have a more profound effect on the shape of things to come than all but a few acts of government over the coming decades. I've driven down from San Francisco because I want to know if and when computers will become capable of intelligent thought, and in all the world, few people can be better equipped to tell me than Justin Rattner, the Intel director who heads its Microprocessor Research Laboratories. In a blue suit and matching tie, with wire specs, he is a jocular textbook image of the grown-up geek, and he self-evidently loves his job. In a featureless grey and white seminar room, we begin by discussing Moore's Law, the projection which has computer processing speeds doubling every 18 months and which he expects to hold good for the next 10 years at least, adding with a chortle that, 'given the way of these things, that's almost like saying we don't see any end to it.' Could the machines exhibit behaviour which we would recognise as intelligent? Could we build machines that were smarter than us? 'There is no question that an extraordinary amount of computing power is required to do that. No one really knows how much. All of our past attempts have fallen well short. But you have to assume that, yes, the day is foreseeable when that would be possible.' Once, thoughts such as these would have been little more than something to kick around down at the wine bar, but that changed in April, when the US internet culture magazine Wired ran a long and detailed article called 'Why the Future Doesn't Need Us', by the co-founder and chief scientist of Sun Microsystems, Bill Joy. The sub-heading read: 'Our most powerful 21st-century technologies - robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech - are threatening to make humans an endangered species.' Anyone who has spent much time on the internet, or hanging around geeks, is familiar with such shrill prophesies, but not from a man like Bill Joy, the billionaire co-author of the Java computer language, who recently co-chaired the Presidential Commission on the Future of IT Research and is reputed to be a profoundly sane, socially conscious man. Wired editor Katrina Heron had chosen him to write the article for these very reasons, and it made an immediate and lasting impact in the US. Taken on its own, Joy's thesis sounded a little alarmist, but plausible. Until recently, he observed, he had expected Moore's Law to hold only until 2010 or so. Yet, thanks to the unexpectedly rapid progress in molecular electronics, it has become clear that 'we should be able to meet or exceed the Moore's Law rate of progress for another 30 years.' By 2030, then, we may be able to mass-produce machines that are a million times more powerful than the personal computers of today. No one knows whether this could ever give rise to consciousness - many of our more intractable existential questions will be answered at this point - but it could certainly allow machines to process information and make decisions with a rapidity and efficiency way beyond our own capabilities. In combination with rapid advances in genetic engineering and nanotechnology, Joy concluded that 'enormous transformative power is being unleashed... these advances open up the possibility to completely redesign the world, for better or worse.' The tiny nanotechnological machines are already being built, but are not yet amenable to remote control. That breakthrough is now expected within 30 years. Of necessity, these devices would be under the direction of computers, which almost anyone could own. They would also, by definition, have the potential for self-replication and thus some form of independence. In Engines of Creation (£7.99, Fourth Estate), Eric Drexler's seminal work on the nanotech revolution, the author detailed the many ways in which it would improve our lives, but he also identified what has come to be known as the 'grey goo problem' - millions of microscopic 'assemblers' running amok, either by accident or design, with enormous and unstoppable destructive force. And, in contrast to industrial, 20th-century technologies, the final, enabling steps in these new ones will not necessarily be the most problematic and ponderous. 'The breakthrough to wild self-replication in robotics, genetic engineering or nanotechnology could come suddenly, reprising the surprise we felt when we learned of the cloning of a mammal,' claimed Joy. He invoked the atomic bomb and the antibiotic-resistant superbugs which haunt modern medicine to remind us that our husbandry of new science has been imperfect before. He might have added BSE and, according to some theories, HIV. The threat being described still felt rather abstract and unreal. Then I went off and did some research of my own, at which point it became clear that Bill Joy was not the only techno boffin serving notice of big and impending change. There was Professor Rodney Brooks, director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT offering the thought that, a few generations hence, 'I don't think we're going to be the same species any more.' There was Freeman Dyson, a distinguished contributor to the Standard Theory of Quantum Electrodynamics, declaring that 'humanity looks to me like a magnificent beginning, but not the final word'; the equally distinguished inventor Ray Kurzweil giving us 'a 50 per cent chance of survival', before adding, archly. 'But then, I've always been accused of being an optimist'; and Hans Moravec, director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania casually observing that 'the robots will eventually succeed us: humans clearly face extinction.' And there is the question of who is going to have access to these powerful forces. Christine Peterson, president of the pro-new technology Foresight Institute just up the road from Intel at Palo Alto, had bluntly told me that, 'any military establishment looks at this stuff and says, \"We need this now.\" There is a race going on, no question. There is also a commercial race.' So, wanting to know whether there were strong links between the private capitalists of Silicon Valley and the military establishment, I contacted Michael Geyer, a professor of Contemporary History at the University of Chicago, who has a particular interest in this area and has written on 'infowar' in the past. The simple answer, he said, is that we can't be sure. 'Every large-scale 20th-century technology had a strong military component,' he began. 'There has been a general view that this is not true of the electronic revolution, but it's still an open question. What we can say is that there is a huge discussion going on about a complete re-making of the military body into a primarily electronic force by 2020. Billions of dollars have been spent on this, but it remains unclear how this relates to the multibillions of dollars flowing out of venture capital. We know the military is there, though the wired community in Silicon Valley, who are mostly suspicious of the State, have yet to acknowledge it. Precisely how much crossover there is remains to be seen. 'In any case, the new technology changes the security agenda out of all recognition. Hardware is no longer the primary issue. For the first time, knowledge and ingenuity can be very destructive weapons. And you never know who's got those.' The things Geyer said reminded me of Justin Rattner's commendation of Intel's latest 'star wars' technology, and also of a conversation I'd had earlier with John Leslie, professor of Philosophy at Guelph University in Canada. A few years ago, Leslie published a book rejoicing in the title The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction (£12.50, Routledge), which was favourably reviewed in this and other papers, but which I haven't been able to mention with a straight face up to now. In it, he maps the many possible routes to our destruction as a species, eventually rating our chances of extinction at a sporting 30 per cent. He sees global warming and biological warfare as more immediate causes for concern than superintelligent computers and/or grey goo. In any case, the danger from these areas may not be quite what it seems. 'Two possible scenarios present themselves here,' he says. 'The first is that the machines take over against our wishes. That seems to me less likely than that they take over with our tacit or explicit blessing. My own view is that, if it were all true, and they were conscious, then fine - but if, as is likely, they weren't conscious in the full sense, then that would be a disaster.' The computers taking over with our blessing? It sound preposterous. Until you speak to Professor Hans Moravec of MIT, who will be waving a white hanky and cheering them on. When I catch him, he's been awake writing continuously for 24 hours. He sounds tired at first, but perks up at the prospect of having a pop at Bill Joy. 'I mean, the thing that was notable about Bill Joy,' he offers cheerily, 'was that he actually accepted the possibility of these things. That was the big transition for him. And then he sort of... panicked - ha ha ha!' Can Moravec understand the rest of the world's dismay at his own lack of panic? 'I have no reason to panic. I've accepted the possibility of intelligent, mobile machines for 40 years. I see it as a major transition in the nature of human life. For me, robots are extensions of humanity. Something I'm always pointing out is that we're 99.9 per cent cultural beings now: the information that's passed from generation to generation in our genome consists of a few billion bits, but there are trillions of bits in our libraries. And we would not be who we are if it wasn't for this cultural information. The robots are simply the point when that cultural information takes over from strict biology. Eventually they might develop in their own directions, but that's the normal situation for descendants. They have their own lives.' Quite apart from the presumed inevitability of the machine's dominance, Moravec sounds as though he's looking forward to replacement. 'Well, I think of it as the most mature and potentially full future that we could have. Everything else seems horrible, stagnant, limiting; probably fatal. If we were to stay just in our biological form, sooner or later some biological cataclysm would come along which we couldn't deal with. By combining with machines, going into this form, we at least have a chance. Intelligence now is a rare and unusual thing in the world. Only human beings have it, and they're actually quite... er... what's the word...?' Dumb? 'Ha ha ha. Yeah, since there's no competition, we've never noticed how bad we are at what we do. And computers have already exploited that. They can already do the job of 10,000 clerks, which shows how badly clerks are fitted for the job they do. But we are suited for seeing and moving and so on. Machines can't do that yet as well as we do.' Will he venture a timescale for these prophecies? 'I have four stages of robots, that resemble reptiles, mammals, primates and humans in terms of what they can do and I expect them to be about a decade apart. And we're not yet at the reptile stage. Things we can produce this decade will be like very small vertebrates in their complexity - like fish. In fact, we're only five years away from commercialisation, with the first robots that will be able to clean floors or guard an area without requiring specialist installation. Machines which can learn in any meaningful sense are still a decade off, though.' Does he have no qualms about working on things that, in his own estimation, could one day subjugate or exterminate his own species? 'Well, yeah, but I've decided that that's inevitable and that it's no different from your children deciding that they don't need you. So I think that we should just gracefully... bow out - ha ha ha. But I think we can have a pretty stable, self-policing system that supports us, though there would probably be some machines which were outside the system, which became wild. I think we can co-exist comfortably and live in some style for a while at least.' And I find myself thinking that Professor Moravec should get out more. Yet, at the same time, two projects currently being developed in university labs imply that his pronouncements are more than just self-serving hyperbole. First, two researchers at Brandeis University in Massachusetts have created a computerised system that automatically creates, evolves, improves and finally builds a variety of simple mobile creatures without significant human intervention. Then there is the aforementioned Professor Warwick at Reading, who hopes that his next implant will allow his computer to record motor signals as they pass through his central nervous system, then recreate the corresponding movement by replaying that recording. There is the additional and infinitely more intriguing possibility that this could work for subjective states involving emotions, memories, pain. Like Moravec, he expects computer intelligence to eclipse human intelligence some time in the next 20 to 30 years, but in contrast to the American, he professes to be worried by the prospect. He sees a possible solution - in fact, the only palatable solution - in augmenting our given, biological selves with computer technology. In joining them, as it were. 'If anything, Moore's Law is speeding up, with processing speeds doubling every year or so now,' he explains. 'We know that machines will have phenomenal memory and speed of processing, so I say, \"Why can't I have a bit of that?\" Machines aren't limited to three dimensions the way we are. I'd love to be able to think in 20 dimensions.' As significant as any potential improvement on our flesh and blood inheritance, however, is the sensation Warwick got from being linked to his computer during the first experiment. 'One of the reactions I had to having the implant was a feeling of affinity with my computer. Once that becomes a permanent state, you're not really a human any more, you're a cyborg. Your values and ethics would be bound to change, I think, and you would view unaugmented humans a little differently.' Consider the attitude we have to cows, he adds. Once we were the same, but whereas we might like them now, we wouldn't necessarily elect one as prime minister (an assertion which, in the interest of decorum, we will allow to pass without further comment). 'It's a dangerous game,' he concedes, 'because we're working with things that could change the world, and you can never be quite sure where that might lead. But that's the story of humanity, isn't it?' Unsurprisingly, this set of circumstances supports a healthy fringe of cultish pseudo-philosophies, with names like Transhumanism and Extropianism, which welcome the prospect of biological and neurological augmentation. They also await the coming of 'singularity', or the 'techno rapture', which is expected to happen when the super-intelligent computers we create acquire the capacity to design their successors, at which stage, it is believed, the cycles of Moore's Law will move from human to machine timescales. Given that computers don't eat or sleep and will have the capacity to think progressively more quickly than us, the cycles of invention, while remaining constant in relative terms, would get shorter and shorter in our subjective human terms, until finally they were racing into infinity, leaving us trailing in their wake, as a no doubt rather grumpy and confused rump of 'posthumanity'. Personally, I love this idea. It'd be like living the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey . But it's obviously bunk. Right? Ian Pearson is one of BT's 'futurologists' whom the company hires out to other organisations on a consultancy basis. He tells me that BT Labs has been saying everything you've just read for years and that, while it is easy to dismiss someone like Kevin Warwick as an attention-seeking nutter, what he says is valid: namely, 'that if you start building machines that have the potential to be smarter than people, you're playing a very, very dangerous game.' Going back to something that Jeremy Paxman said on the radio, though - couldn't we reassert our corporeal authority by simply switching the buggers off? 'Perhaps,' he says. 'But imagine machines which make use of solar energy and/or are linked to a grid, with battery backup. Ten years after they've reached human equivalence, we can expect the computers to be millions of times smarter than us, with an infinitely more subtle grasp of physics and responses which, in the context of our slow biological brains, would seem instantaneous. If they were hostile, it would be like us fighting chimps. 'A few years ago, we realised that we weren't far away from having a global telephone network with as many connections as the human brain. We've passed that now. BT tried to explore whether there was any danger of consciousness occurring, but had to give up, because we don't know what makes a thing conscious. Myself, I think we'll muddle through. The biggest fear for me is a big fundamentalist, anti-IT backlash. At some point, governments are going to have to wake up to these possibilities and start planning. I hope they do.' Do we believe any of this? Soft and inadequate-brained as I am, serious concern seemed easier in Silicon Valley, where virtually everyone you meet works in computer-related industries, talks about little else and can easily have you wondering whether the cyborgs aren't already among us. Even there, scepticism is easy to find, though. Confronted with his lead role in our future extinction, Intel's Justin Rattner took a sanguine line. 'Well, you know,' he chuckled, 'those of us who were around in the 50s remember all the visions of what life was going to be like in the year 2000, with flying cars and tourist rockets to the moon. Technology just doesn't advance in this nice, linear fashion. And society represents tremendous back pressure on these things.' So he thought Bill Joy was fretting over nothing? 'I think... that he must have seen The Matrix too many times.' And with that, he was up and off. But was that a bolt I glimpsed in his neck?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2000/dec/20/tvandradio","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2000-12-20T01:31:10Z","webTitle":"Hear this","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/dec/20/tvandradio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/dec/20/tvandradio","fields":{"headline":"Hear this","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Steve Lamacq - The Evening Session (8.0pm, Radio 1) sees Steve having a chat with Radiohead in their local pub, where they later perform a set.

Al Maha is an exclusive oasis located 45 minutes from Dubai within a 25 sq km desert conservation reserve. The preservation of desert ecology is the basis of the Al Maha ecotourism project, along with the reintroduction of indigenous wildlife and flora: the concept was initiated by His Highness General Sheikh Mohamed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai. What sort of animals are there? Currently we have 124 Arabian oryx, four varieties of gazelle, eight falcons, Arabian horses, camels and 17 eland. Do the guests rough it too? Not at all. The resort is designed to resemble a Bedouin encampment around a date palm plantation. The guest suites look like tents and each is surrounded by a deck and has its own plunge pool. The bathrooms are particularly spacious and all the furnishings are based on traditional items - we have over 3,000 antiques and art pieces. But there can't be much water in a desert? Al Maha is located on the largest natural water reserves of Dubai. A water recycling plant on the site purifies, recycles and refilters ground water. All waste water is recycled and used in irrigation. We use solar energy to heat water for the staff quarters. What has been your most memorable experience? The success rate of the wildlife breeding programmes has been great and on several occasions guests have witnessed the birth of Arabian oryx calves from the decks of their suites. Our biggest challenge is meeting the expectations of luxury-seeking guests while making the whole experience relevant to the desert location and the region's heritage. Our menus, for example, are international but we also try to introduce typical Gulf food. There are also perceptions of 'Arabian' culture which may not be appropriate in Bedouin culture: what is largely thought of as Arabian in Europe is often Moroccan or Lebanese. What about about a day out in the desert? Activities included in the basic package are falconry, guided 4x4 safari, archery and camel and horse-riding.

Surely solar power is the most intermittent source there is, being unavailable just when you most need it - on a cold winter's night. The two ecologically-sound power sources are waves (almost always) and the tides (unstoppable), both of which we have in abundance in the UK. Both of these can be harnessed in environmentally-friendly ways, including the necessary element of energy storage. However, if power is to be generated locally, then there is a good case for using solar power for air-conditioning, particularly in the tropics. It needs little more than an ammonia-cycle refrigerator, which is low-maintenance and non-polluting. Tim Gossling Cambridge • Wind farms are an important part of future energy generation. I agree that we need large-scale subsidisation and investment in solar power. However, being geographically challenged as we are in the UK, when we most need solar energy the sun is not shining. The current technology would be hard pushed to provide us all with sufficient heating in winter. Conversely, the wind resource is often largest in winter. If we are going to continue using energy at the current rate, we need to utilise the range of renewable resources at our disposal. Regarding the aesthetics of wind turbines, they should be judged within the context of their industrial counterparts. I personally believe they are rather beautiful compared to a nuclear or coal-fired power station. Ag Stephens Norwich • When we wanted to erect a turbine to provide power for our Welsh home in the Black Mountains, we were mortified at the distorted and malicious criticism levelled at us by a vocal faction in the valley. Luckily, we canvassed opinion locally and were delighted to find a large majority in favour of our turbine, and the planners gave their support too. In our case, a mains connection would have been too expensive. Our photovoltaic panels are of limited benefit, especially in winter (and at night), but linked to our new turbine they will help us make a small contribution to saving fossil fuel. The wind power output is indeed intermittent, like other natural forces, but certainly not pitiful nor pointless industrialisation. How about some positive thinking, you nimbys? Such hatred helps no one with an eye to global warming. Simon Marr-Johnson London A climate of blame While the rise in racist crime you report is disturbing (Forward march, November 22), I am concerned that you do not indicate whether there has been any increase in the incidence of racial harassment by individuals from the ethnic minority population on members of the indigenous one. I live in a borough where many of the indigenous population feel threatened by the growth of the ethnic minority community, and point to a significant number of assaults by ethnic minority youths on their indigenous peers as reported in the local press (which is a rising problem recognised by the local police). This is so much so that many in the indigenous community perceive areas of the borough where ethnic minorities are concentrated as \"no go\" areas, even though the reality does not bear this out. All racially-motivated crime is unacceptable and unforgivable, but while the tenor of reporting appears to lay the onus on the indigenous community only, it carries the danger of creating resentment among the indigenous community and unintentionally promoting resistance to the acceptance of living in a multicultural society. Jeremy Sutcliffe Oldham Charity checks As the author of the research into cancer charities at Manchester Business School, I would like to respond to Stuart Etherington's letter (November 22). By necessity, only the highlights of my 275-page research into the changes in the top 25 cancer charities in the period 1992-97, including the \"charitable efficiency\" ratio, have been publicised. The majority of feedback from the charities able to take time to listen to, and discuss, more than just the highlights has been that the research is a worthwhile contribution to the debate on the future of cancer charities. The level of reported cooperation between cancer charities formed part of my research and I would certainly agree with Etherington that all charities could do more to publicise how they work together. One of my main conclusions is that more cooperation would be beneficial to the patient. This would also reassure the public that the money they donate is being used to maximum impact, while minimising confusion over the proliferation of brands. We hope to organise a seminar to present the research to London-based cancer charities and representatives of umbrella organisations. If the National Council for Voluntary Organisations would be prepared to host such an event, I believe the benefits of joint working would continue to be seen, supported by more detailed research than appears to have previously been undertaken. Hugh McDonnell Manchester • While the principle of charities grouping themselves under a general cause is a sensible one, it would not work in the cases of mental health charities Mind and Sane, which have differing views on many issues - particularly care in the community. Richard Kidd Andover Mind But if the figures are correct and there are 37 charities to help seafarers and their families, then that is, by far, too many and the charity commission should inquire into it. • Write to Guardian Society, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER; or fax 020-7713 4154 or email society@theguardian.com Please supply your full address.

My point is simply this. We must work at resolving these conflicts or finding a way through. And we should recognise that to be environmentally conscious isn't a punishment. It is indeed in our long term interests; and it can also be of benefit, short and medium term too. What's more there is a real concern and desire amongst our people, within realistic bounds, to do the right thing. We have children and granchildren. We care for them. We know that despoiling the environment today will mean hardship, even death for them tomorrow. Call it idealism or even just family values: there is an energy and commitment there we can harness. Where 15 years ago many thought that there would always be a trade-off between progress and the environment, we can now see a way through. What becomes clear is that to preserve what we value most - our local environment, the countryside around us - we must protect the whole earth, and do so by pioneering new ways of building, working, living. New technologies to deliver a low carbon economy; to use our finite resources more efficiently, to reform national and international institutions and create positive incentives to be green. In short, we don't halt progress and retreat into the past, nor do we carry on regardless. Instead we take pride in our progress. Using our creativity in partnership to protect the environment. The threat We have made a lot of progress over this Parliament. Through John Prescott's leadership, and the hard work of Michael here on the platform with me, we can point to measurable achievements. We are on track to meet our Kyoto targets. Air quality is improving. London now has the cleanest river of any major city. But we have to face a stark fact. Neither we here in Britain, nor our partners abroad, have succeeded in reversing the overall destructive trend. The environmental challenge continues to grow and become more urgent: • There are alarming changes in our atmosphere, in global temperatures, in weather patterns, in sea levels and in the protective ozone layer. As a result, across the world millions face drought, flooding, disease. Here in the UK we too face threats - the prospect of exotic diseases becoming commonplace, of increased levels of skin cancer, of floods in some years, droughts in others, of low lying areas being swallowed by the sea. • Global population growth will put increased pressure on natural resources. The world pop is set to rise from 6bn to 9bn by 2050. So that economies across the world have the opportunity to develop, we must all use resources far more efficiently and switch to clean technologies. • Fresh water is being polluted or simply used up. Demand is doubling every 21 years while supply is broadly unchanged. • Soil degradation has affected two-thirds of the world's agricultural lands over the last 50 years, and the situation is getting worse. • Half the world's wetlands have been lost over the past century and with them their unique plants and animals; and this is accelerating • One in ten of the world's tree species are at risk of extinction, and increasingly whole forest systems are under threat • Fishing fleets are still 40 per cent larger than the oceans can sustain and yet it still benefits from subsidies, world wide • Here in the UK farmland birds are disappearing, the house sparrow, once more cockney than the Cockneys, is now a rarity in London, and congestion means that urban traffic moves at the same speed as in 1890. Of two things I am certain. We are not going to turn this round unless we re-engage the political system on the importance of the environmental challenge. We are not going to be able to engage consumers and business unless we offer them a positive agenda. A new approach to the environment We need to build a new coalition for the environment, a coalition that works with the grain of consumers, business and science, not against them. A coalition that harnesses consumer demand for a better environment, and encourages businesses to see the profit of the new green technologies. and a coalition that stretches across national frontiers. The central theme of our approach is a more productive use of environmental resources. It is clear that if we are to continue to grow, and share the benefits of that growth; we must reduce the impact of growth on the environment. Some commentators estimate that we'll need a tenfold increase in the efficiency with which we use resources by 2050 only to stand still. Above all, we need to be clear about our priorities, and the principles that underlie our approach: • First, the greatest threat to our environment today is climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution has said that the UK will have to cut the CO2 we produce by 60% by 2050 if we are to slow down the pace of change. If there is one immediate issue that threatens global disaster, it is the changes in our atmosphere. • Second, problems need to be addressed at the right level. A problem like climate change requires international as well as national action. The reason for taking the lead in cutting national emissions, as we have in the UK, is to give us the standing and authority in international negotiations. And developed countries, as the principle producers of greenhouse gases, should set an example for developing ones. • Third, we should harness consumer demand, not stifle it. We should not be trying to reduce people's aspirations, but rather find innovative ways of satisfying those aspirations. As our societies become more prosperous, so people's demand for a better environment is growing. More and more people want to buy green. We should encourage that, and harness that green consumer power in our environmental policies • Fourth, we must stimulate science and innovation. I reject the pessimistic notion that most environmental problems can only be managed, not solved. Technological advance does offer opportunities, particularly to counter climate change and provide alternatives to finite energy resources. • Fifth, we need to use environmental resources more efficiently and to become a low-carbon, recycling economy. We need to become much more effective about how we use finite resources. Stephen Byers set out a radical new direction in his speech to Greenpeace's Business Conference earlier this month, focussing on resource productivity and the Government's programme to boost renewable energy. • Lastly, we should see protecting the environment as a business opportunity. There is a growing market for environmental goods and services - currently worth an amazing US$335 billion - as large as the world market for pharmaceuticals or aerospace. I am not saying that the interests of business and the environment have become identical. But we should exploit them and develop them when they are. Otherwise, history shows us the environment risks being the loser. New Labour's Green Agenda I make no apology for the priority we have given education, health and crime. Yet no other British Government has had a Deputy Prime Minister in charge of environment policy. And no other British Government has put the environment at the heart of its policy-making across the board - from foreign affairs to the national curriculum - in the way this Government has. Since 1997, we have: • Taken a lead internationally, as at Kyoto. • Introduced an air quality strategy going beyond even the tough new European standards • Cleaned up decades of pollution of our beaches and rivers, and given greater protection to important wildlife sites • Factored environmental considerations into all our legislation and policy, from the Utilities Act to innovative fiscal measures such as incentives and hypothecation • And as a result of the Comprehensive Spending Review, started to invest billions in transport to increase choice and cut congestion and pollution Yet I would be the first to say that there is still a lot more we could and will do. John Prescott will shortly publish the final version of our strategy on Climate Change. It will set out how Britain plans to deliver its international obligations to cut greenhouse gases by 12.5% and move towards a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions. This will include a 10% target for energy from renewables by 2010. As part of the Climate Change Levy package, businesses will be able to claim capital allowances for investments they make in energy-saving technologies from next April. I can also announce that we will shortly be launching a new Carbon Trust in Britain that will channel up to £50 million a year developing low-carbon technology, partly funded from the Climate Change Levy. We have worked closely with business and the research community since their participation is vital to the Trust's long-term success. The Trust will take the lead on low-carbon technology and innovation in this country, and put Britain in the lead internationally. We will also be setting up an office to export Britain's low-carbon technologies, the Kyoto Mechanisms Office. This was suggested to me at a meeting I had on climate change with business leaders earlier this year. By encouraging the private sector to invest in innovative energy projects abroad, it will help tackle climate change and allow British business to seize new opportunities. The Office will start work in April 2001. Next Spring, we will be launching the first national CO2 emissions trading system anywhere in the world. Emissions trading is one of the most powerful ways of harnessing the market to cut greenhouse gases. The trading system will set overall limits on emissions for CO2 producers entering the system, and allow them to trade \"emission allowances\" amongst themselves, to the profit of the cleanest factories and companies. If we are to reduce our dependence on oil and high-carbon energy, we will need to develop commercially viable renewable energy. I believe government has a key role to play in assisting business build up the economies of scale in these new technologies so that they can compete effectively. Today, we are announcing proposals for £50 million from the New Opportunities Fund to support offshore wind and biomass. The DTI is already providing £39 million for new offshore wind turbines, and the first are about to go into operation off Blyth. Helen Liddle has set up a task force to examine ways of promoting solar energy. And I have also asked the Performance and Innovation Unit to undertake a comprehensive study into the future of renewable energy, with a view to increasing substantially our long-term investment. Any environmental policy has to address the implications of the car. Transport produces around 25% of global CO2 and rising. Making public transport more attractive will take us only so far. The long-term solution is to make vehicles cleaner and more fuel efficient. That is why we have used the tax system to roll out cleaner fuels. Lead in petrol is now a thing of the past, and we are now using tax incentives to promote ultra-low sulphur petrol. Through the EU, we have persuaded manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency by 25%. Vehicle Excise Duty is now linked to vehicle emissions for the first time. Toyota and Honda are now selling \"hybrid\" cars which are twice as efficient as conventional models. Honda's Insight does 80 mpg. Fuel cell powered electric cars will offer even more - truly pollution-free motoring. Both Mercedes and Ford plan to have them in the showrooms by 2004. We will also be doing more to protect Britain's urban and rural environment. Our Countryside and Rights of Way Bill will protect wildlife and sites of special scientific interest. In our forthcoming Rural White Paper we will set out policies for a living countryside which is economically vibrant, conserves wildlife and landscapes and which everyone can enjoy. And the Urban White Paper will set out our National Strategy for Neighbourhood renewal. We are also proposing that the New Opportunities Funds should invest another £50 million for quality of life in urban and rural settlements and for green spaces. On recycling, we want to do more to harness the power of the market. The new Waste Resource Action Programme, led by business, will develop markets for recycled materials. A proposed further 50 million pounds from The New Opportunities Fund will help provide kerbside recycling for 700,000 households. I want to see every local authority offering doorstep recycling to take advantage of these new markets. And the office co-ordinating government procurement will soon begin trialling the purchasing of recycled products, using government purchasing to expand the market. On regulation, our aim must be to raise environmental standards without imposing unnecessary burdens on business. Often, the most effective approach to raising standards is a cross-border one. That is why we are working with the European Commission and other member states to improve the regulatory process in Europe. This brings me to environmental diplomacy. The international climate change negotiations remain a key government priority, and we will be taking a leading role in The Hague next month. I also want to extend the EU's economic reform agenda to new energy saving technologies. And I can announce today that I plan to attend the next Earth Summit in 2002, and I will be encouraging other world leaders to join us there. Business, technology and the environment Fifteen years ago, if you said business will help save the environment people would have laughed at you. Today, I believe that is a serious proposition. As BP's John Browne has said, the enlightened company increasingly recognises that there are good commercial reasons for being ahead of the pack when it comes to issues to do with the environment. Environmentally-aware oil companies are finding ways to recapture the CO2 produced by plant and equipment and pump it back underground to enhance the recovery of oil. They are working with car manufacturers on new technologies, from developing fuel cell cars, to putting hydrogen-powered buses on the road in Europe. Shell is playing a major role in the move away from oil in power generation. Like its competitor BP, it is investing heavily in solar power. ABB recently shifted its focus from being a builder of traditional large-scale power plants to focus on small scale renewable technologies. It expects alternative energy solutions to account for US$1 billion worth of business for the company within the next five years. It is increasingly clear that energy generation in the future will become a spectrum: from the cleaner extraction of energy from fossil fuels; through the move from liquid to cleaner gas fuels; new technologies that convert hydrocarbon fuels into energy without combustion; to, at its greenest end, the carbon free technologies of wind and solar. The City and investment community is beginning to recognise the new commercial and environmental realities, and to make money out of them. The return on equity of the new Dow Jones Sustainability Group Index averaged 15%, compared to 8% for the regular index for the first half of this year. And more individual investors are choosing ethical investment portfolios which reflect their values. Legislation earlier this year on Statements of Investment Principles required pension funds for the first time to disclose whether they take ethical, environmental or social factors into account in their decisions. The World Business Council on Sustainable Development, of which many of you here today are members, is driving forward the agenda to increase the efficient use of resources. I would also like to see more reporting on environmental and social performance. The pioneers of environmental reporting - companies like BA, BT, British Gas, and BP - are seeing increasing benefits from both improved efficiencies and public image as a result. This is something that all companies should be doing, and I am issuing a challenge, today, to all of the top 350 companies to be publishing annual environment reports by the end of 2001. The role of civil society Increasingly, NGOs are also putting more and more energy into offering solutions in partnership with business and government. For example, the Worldwide Fund for Nature and Unilever have set up the Marine Stewardship Council to protect our endangered fish stocks. Thames Water and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust have converted redundant reservoirs and treatment at Barn Elms into a fantastic new wildlife habitat. Fourteen companies, eight NGOs and three Government departments are working together on the Digital Futures project, to try to ensure that the e-commerce revolution happens in the most environmentally friendly way possible. And eight years ago Greenpeace began research on Greenfreeze refrigeration technology to reduce the destruction of the Ozone layer. It is now a highly successful example of green organisation and industry working together for the benefit of the Ozone layer. Coca Cola and Unilever have just announce they will move towards such alternative refrigerants such as Greenfreeze by 2005. Government, business, the NGOs and the public need to move forward together. That is why we have set up the new Sustainable Development Commission. I have asked Jonathan Porritt to chair it and I am very pleased to launch it today. The members, drawn from business, local government, pressure groups and academia, will build a consensus, monitor our progress, and suggest ways we can reconcile the needs of the environment, the economy and society. Conclusion So the outlook is not all bleak. There is real progress. But it is a race against time, lethargy, and indifference. It is an urgent issue. People feel it; but they don't always know how to make a difference. Millions of people around the country are \"green\" in their actions, their beliefs, what they care about. They want the air they breath to be fresh. They want the countryside they live in or visit to be protected. They have respect for the world around them - hate cruelty to animals, hate the destruction of natural beauty. They want their neighbourhoods to have parks and be free from litter, grafitti, kids with nothing to do, and crime. Millions recycle, more would like to. Millions of children care passionately about the environment. That is their politics. But they need to know the \"how\" as well as the \"why\". The root of my political beliefs is the idea of community: of solidarity. Today such an idea can only live on, based on mutual rights and responsibilities. The essence of environmental politics is the notion of responsibility to nature and future generations to protect and enhance the environment. Its why we wrote it into the new Clause IV of our Party Constitution. We have to show how this strongly held belief can translate into practical action. To do that, we need a partnership between government, business and the environmental movement, to extend the frontiers of progress, to show the way through. We need more understanding, more dialogue, a healthy recognition of areas of disagreement, and then a common campaign of explanation, to put across the urgency of the problems and the viability of the solutions. We have one common aim: to show how by doing good to the environment, we enrich our lives, in quality and prosperity. Concern for the environment is not a yoke on our necks. It is the lifting of the yoke. The burden is lighter. The way is clearer. I believe it can be done. Let's sell the new insight - we can be richer by being greener; and by being greener we will enrich the quality of our lives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
