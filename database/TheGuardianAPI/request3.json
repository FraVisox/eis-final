The huge investment, calculated by Aurora Energy Research, an Oxford-based consultancy, would increase the UK’s offshore wind power capacity by four times what it is today, to reach 40GW by 2030. The wind energy industry has become one of the country’s most prized industrial success stories. In the past 10 years the capacity of the UK’s offshore turbines has grown from 1GW to almost 10GW at the start of 2020, and building costs have been driven down by almost two-thirds. The government’s new plan has emerged as central to Britain’s aim to “build back better” after the coronavirus crisis towards its 2050 climate goals. But the prime minister’s green agenda will still need to clear multiple hurdles to prove that the promise of billions in investment and much-needed green jobs can be delivered. Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, one of the largest investors in Britain’s renewable energy industry, said there is “no shortage of capital or investor appetite in offshore wind” but the pace and scale of the industry’s growth will depend on the government’s ability to grant new seabed licences and project contracts at record speed. The government plans to attract investment from the private sector through a major contract auction next spring, which will also include support for onshore wind and solar power projects for the first time in four years. This upcoming auction alone could secure more than £20bn of investment and create 12,000 jobs, mainly in the construction sector, according to RenewableUK. “I am absolutely confident that the industry can achieve this,” said Anderson. “My only nervousness is that people will start to see the 40GW as a cap. We should achieve that, and power past it. We are going to need far more clean electricity.” The government is under pressure to produce a programme of measures that will show the UK is taking its net-zero target seriously, as host nation of the crunch UN climate talks, Cop26, which have been postponed by a year because of Covid-19. So far, the only sizeable green measure in the chancellor’s rescue plan has been a £3bn scheme for home insulation. Even with the push to offshore wind, that still leaves a lot to be done to reach net zero. Lady Brown of Cambridge, deputy chair of the Committee on Climate Change, said: “If we’re to reach net zero UK emissions by 2050, we’ll need to see similarly bold commitments to cut emissions from our buildings, industry, transport and land.” There are also doubts about whether the green jobs the government says will accompany the offshore wind expansion will materialise. At least 60% of the “content” of offshore wind farms will be made in the UK, the government has promised. Sue Ferns, from the trade union Prospect, said the prime minister’s desire to kickstart a green jobs revolution has been set out before, but “the reality has never quite matched up”. “There is a long way to go,” she said. “The number of green jobs is still below 2014 levels despite repeated promises from the government, partly due to particular supply chain jobs being created overseas. If the prime minister’s plan for wind is to have anywhere near the promised impact on jobs then it needs a credible plan for a functional UK supply chain.” The government’s £160m investment in upgrading the UK’s ports to manage the size of a new generation of mega-turbines will help to create supply chain hubs in port communities which face economic decline. Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group, said the “much-needed commitment to invest in port infrastructure” should be matched by “a clear focus on low-carbon skills” to help to grow domestic supply chains and create jobs in the sector. But Britain will need to move fast to catch up after the head start clinched by its European neighbours, according to Dennis Clark, a 40-year North Sea oil and gas veteran who chaired Offshore Group Newcastle, a supplier to oil platforms. Clark said the companies building offshore wind farms currently in the UK were sourcing the high-value end of their supply chain from their own countries, including Spain and Norway, and from low-cost countries such as Dubai, where working conditions and standards were lower. “We have missed out on tens of thousands of jobs, which have gone overseas,” he said. “Brexit gives us the opportunity to change that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jan/03/child-labour-toxic-leaks-the-price-we-could-pay-for-a-greener-future","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-01-03T08:15:02Z","webTitle":"Child labour, toxic leaks: the price we could pay for a greener future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/03/child-labour-toxic-leaks-the-price-we-could-pay-for-a-greener-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jan/03/child-labour-toxic-leaks-the-price-we-could-pay-for-a-greener-future","fields":{"headline":"Child labour, toxic leaks: the price we could pay for a greener future","bodyText":"The battle to stave off Earth’s looming climate crisis is driving engineers to develop hosts of new green technologies. Wind and solar plants are set to replace coal and gas power stations, while electric cars oust petrol and diesel vehicles from our roads. Slowly our dependance on fossil fuels is set to diminish and so ease global heating. But scientists warn there will be an environmental price to pay for this drive to create a world powered by green technology. Prospecting for the materials to construct these devices, then mining them, could have very serious ecological consequences and major impacts on biodiversity, they say. “The move towards net zero carbon emissions is going to create new stresses on our planet, at least in the short term,” said Prof Richard Herrington, head of earth sciences at the Natural History Museum, London. “We are going to have to learn how to consider profit and loss with regard to ecosystems just as we do now when we are considering economic issues.” Metals such as lithium and cobalt provide examples of the awkward issues that lie ahead, said Herrington. Both elements are needed to make lightweight rechargeable batteries for electric cars and for storing power from wind and solar plants. Their production is likely to increase significantly over the next decade – and that could cause serious ecological problems. In the case of cobalt, 60% of the world’s supply comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo where large numbers of unregulated mines use children as young as seven as miners. There they breathe in cobalt-laden dust that can cause fatal lung ailments while working tunnels that are liable to collapse. “Men, women and children are working without even the most basic protective equipment such as gloves and face masks,” said Mark Dummett of Amnesty International, which has investigated the cobalt-mining crisis in DRC. “In one village we visited, people showed us how the water in the local stream that they drank was contaminated by the discharge of waste from a mineral processing plant.” Then there is the issue of lithium mining. World production is set to soar over the next decade. Yet mining is linked to all sorts of environmental headaches. In the so-called Lithium Triangle of South America – made up of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia – vast quantities of water are pumped from underground sources to help extract lithium from ores, and this has been linked to the lowering of ground water levels and the spread of deserts. Similarly in Tibet, a toxic chemical leak from the Ganzizhou Rongda Lithium mine poisoned the local Lichu river in 2016 and triggered widespread protests in the region. Nor will these ecological problems be confined to specialist metals, analysts have pointed out. They say that rising demands for traditional materials such as cement – for building hydro-electric dams – or for copper, to provide cables to link wind and solar farms to cities and to build electric cars, could also cause widespread environmental damage unless care is taken. Our growing appetite for copper provides a striking illustration of the issues. Thousands of tonnes are needed to create wind or solar power devices while electric vehicles use two or three times more copper than those powered by a diesel or petrol engine. As a result, the world’s appetite for copper is likely to jump by more than 300% by 2050, according to one recent report. “You need tens of kilograms more copper for an electric car compared with one with a petrol engine,” said Herrington. “That means, if you want to turn all the UK’s 31m cars into electric vehicles you would require about 12% of the world’s entire copper output – just for Britain. That is an unrealistic demand, given that we are hoping to be making electric cars only within a decade.” Harrington said it was inevitable that there would an expansion in mining and in providing energy for refining ores which, combined, would have real environmental impacts. “We are going to have to do that in a way that creates profits but also serves people and the planet.” In addition to these issues, the proposed expansion of nuclear power in the UK – to satisfy demand no longer met by coal or gas plants – is likely to lead to the creation of increased amounts of nuclear waste. However, the UK still has no method for safely storing nuclear waste underground and relies on keeping highly radioactive remnants from power plant operations above ground. These stores may have to be expanded significantly in future. One solution put forward to these green technology problems would be to limit the exploitation of resources on land and turn instead to the sea to gather the materials we need. Several promising marine sources have been pinpointed, with the most attention focusing on metal nodules which litter some parts of the ocean floor. These potato-sized globs of mineral are rich in copper, cobalt, manganese and other metals. According to the International Seabed Authority, some deposits contain millions of tonnes of cobalt, copper and manganese. As a result, several organisations are now surveying the most promising of these deposits, in particular the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in international waters in the Pacific Ocean. These could be hoovered up using robot submersibles that would criss-cross the 4.5m sq km that make up the zone. However, recent research by marine scientists have also revealed that despite the Clarion-Clipperton Zone’s depth – it lies between 4,000 and 5,500 metres below the surface – the ocean floor there is also rich is sea-life. One survey, in 2017, found more than 30 species new to science living on the zone’s abyssal plain, most of them xenophyophores – considered the world’s largest living single-celled organisms. Hoovering up the nodules could devastate these life forms, marine scientists have warned. “At present, we still don’t have enough data about the sea floor to be sure what the impact would be of mining there,” said Adrian Glover, a deep-sea ecology researcher at the Natural History Museum. “However, when we do, it’s going to be a big question for society. If these are environments rich in biodiversity that could be easily damaged, will it be better or worse to exploit them compared with exploiting our rainforests on land? That could be a very difficult issue to resolve.” • This article was amended on 4 January 2021 because an earlier version referred to ‘abysmal plain’ when abyssal plain was the intended reference."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/nov/07/global-investment-in-cutting-greenhouse-gases-fell-by-11-in-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-07T00:01:39Z","webTitle":"Global investment in cutting greenhouse gases fell by 11% in 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/07/global-investment-in-cutting-greenhouse-gases-fell-by-11-in-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/nov/07/global-investment-in-cutting-greenhouse-gases-fell-by-11-in-2018","fields":{"headline":"Global investment in cutting greenhouse gases fell by 11% in 2018","bodyText":"Investment in greenhouse gas emission reduction fell last year despite the growing urgency of the climate crisis, and the benefits of outlays were cancelled out by investments globally in fossil fuels and other dirty industries, finds a report by the Climate Policy Initiative. Global climate finance hit a record high of $612bn (£476bn) in 2017, according to CPI advisers, but fell back 11% after that bumper year to $546bn in 2018. Less public money for low-carbon transport and lower private-sector investment in renewable energy were the causes of the drop. However, the average investment for 2017 and 2018 was 25% higher than for the period 2015 and 2016. “Given the urgency of the climate challenge it is a positive sign that we have passed the half trillion dollar mark of investment towards climate change activities,” said Barbara Buchner, executive director of climate finance at CPI, which published its assessment on Thursday. The study, entitled Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019, found that investment at least more than three times as high as current levels would be needed annually until 2050 to clean up the world’s energy generation systems. On top of that, adapting to the impacts of climate breakdown is likely to cost more than $180bn a year from 2020. However, only $30bn a year was spent in the last two years, an increase of about a third on 2015 and 2016 levels. Buchner said: “[Current investment] is simply not enough, especially as investments in polluting industries continue to effectively cancel out these efforts to address climate change. Leaders should be focused on total economic transformation.” On the plus side, the analysts said, money spent on renewable energy and low-carbon transport now went much further in cutting emissions, as the costs of such technology had dropped rapidly. Investment in cutting emissions in developing countries was $356bn in 2017-18, compared with $270bn for the previous two-year period. More than half of climate finance globally comes from the private sector. Climate finance is one of the key pillars of international climate-change negotiations, and the role of rich countries in assisting poor countries with investment will be a vexed topic of discussion at the COP25 UN climate talks in December, which are in Madrid following civil unrest in Chile. Buchner said: “There are some bright spots, but our study is very clear – governments, development finance institutions and investors need to make a major shift in how they invest if they want to avoid climate change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/may/15/australias-reserve-bank-fuels-call-for-post-pandemic-renewables-push","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-14T17:30:16Z","webTitle":"Australia's Reserve Bank fuels call for post-pandemic renewables push","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/15/australias-reserve-bank-fuels-call-for-post-pandemic-renewables-push","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/may/15/australias-reserve-bank-fuels-call-for-post-pandemic-renewables-push","fields":{"headline":"Australia's Reserve Bank fuels call for post-pandemic renewables push","bodyText":"Research by the Reserve Bank showing renewable energy investment fell sharply last year is fuelling calls for federal and state governments to back changes to help the industry rebound and drive a post-pandemic recovery. Renewable energy surged to make up nearly 5% of non-mining business investment across Australia in 2018, according to the research note by RBA economists, but the number of large-scale clean projects reaching the point of commencement slumped about 50% last year. Investment is expected to fall further over the next year or two, in part due to the national renewable energy target being filled and not replaced and challenges in integrating solar and wind farms in remote parts of the national grid. The Morrison government has defended criticism of its response to the climate crisis in part by saying record levels of wind and solar power were added to the grid last year as investment in 2018 flowed through. It is yet to acknowledge the subsequent fall. The note says the renewable energy industry had supported activity and employment, particularly in regional areas. While most components used in solar and wind farms are imported, the RBA found 25-40% of spending went to local suppliers in some cases, and manufacturing companies had reported stronger demand for locally produced electricity generation equipment. The former Liberal leader John Hewson, now at the Australian National University’s Crawford school of public policy and a director of an energy storage business, said the RBA had “gone out of its way to make a point” about the importance of renewable power to the economy. “There’s no doubt this is more than a nudge and wink. It is saying this is where we should be going,” he said. “With Covid, it’s even more important. It is an opportunity to take a long-term strategic view in the national interest and looking ahead to where the country should be going given its [solar and wind] assets.” The RBA note was published online on 19 March, before the impact of the Covid-19 imposed economic shutdown. Since the pandemic there has been a growing push internationally and in Australia for policymakers to use stimulus programs designed to help the economic recovery to also address the climate crisis. Hewson said the renewable energy industry did not require subsidies, but needed improved regulations and a clear policy framework that made clear fossil fuels would be phased out and the country would move to low greenhouse gas emissions over the next three decades. With renewable energy cheaper than its fossil fuel competitors, he said the grid could run on 100% renewable energy well before 2050 with the right support. Erwin Jackson, policy director with the Investor Group on Climate Change, said the RBA note showed renewable investment had been an important contributor to economic growth but had fallen, in part due to policy paralysis. “The critical implication of the analysis is that the industry faces the risk of a boom-bust cycle,” he said. “Governments can help stimulate new investment, and in turn new jobs and growth, by prioritising a net zero emissions transition and clean energy plans in a sustainable recovery from Covid-19.” The RBA research echoes assessments by industry group the Clean Energy Council and consultants Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which both found investment in renewable energy projects was cut in half last year. Alan Rai, a former senior economist at the RBA, now a director with consultancy Baringa Partners, said the central bank’s focus on the scale and benefits of renewable energy spending was instructive. The bank had been concerned about the level of non-mining investment since the global financial crisis in 2008, he said. “The fact that renewables have become such a big pipeline of non-mining investment and then fallen drew their attention,” he said. “It is important to the country on a macroeconomic level.” The report found the longer-term outlook for clean energy investment was more positive, but would depend on government policy, electricity grid considerations and wholesale electricity prices holding up. Prices have fallen in recent months and are expected to stay low if the economic impact of the shutdown is extended. Prof Frank Jotzo, director of ANU’s Centre for Climate and Energy Policy, said the renewable energy boom has helped bring down electricity prices in the wholesale market and cut emissions. Electricity sector emissions were 7% lower in the first quarter than at the same in 2019. But he said lower electricity prices meant lower revenue for renewable plants, and there were no longer sizeable subsidies. “If the Covid economic trouble turns into a prolonged recession, this could also pull the rug from under planned wind and solar power investments,” he said. “That means a risk that there may not be sufficient renewable power available to easily cover for the next coal plant shutting down. It also means that we would see an end to big annual emissions reductions from the power sector, making it harder to achieve the 2030 emissions target.” Jotzo said federal and state governments should step into the breach and contract for the construction of wind and solar parks in identified renewable energy zones. “Public investments or financial guarantees for developments in the renewable energy zones are a safe bet, because we know that these investments will be needed, and they will be an excellent way to stimulate the economy, especially in the regions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/19/uk-solar-power-growth-halves-for-second-year-running","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T11:47:19Z","webTitle":"UK solar power growth halves for second year running","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/19/uk-solar-power-growth-halves-for-second-year-running","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/19/uk-solar-power-growth-halves-for-second-year-running","fields":{"headline":"UK solar power growth halves for second year running","bodyText":"New solar power installations halved in the UK last year for the second year in a row, as the fallout of government subsidy cuts continued to shake the sector. Labour said the figures showed the government’s commitment to green energy was “nothing but an empty PR move”. The UK numbers were so poor that they caused overall EU solar growth to flatline at a time when record amounts of new solar were added globally. Europe’s solar trade body said the UK had the slowest growth of the world’s top 20 solar markets, the lowest prospect for growth among its European peers in coming years and the worst political outlook. James Watson, the chief executive of SolarPowerEurope, said: “Solar power has been voted the most popular energy source in the UK, it is therefore sad to see the UK government not take advantage of the huge potential of solar.” New solar capacity in the UK declined to 0.95GW last year, down from 1.97GW in 2016 and 4.1GW in 2015. The fall was so steep that the UK acted as a drag on the EU as a whole. “Even though 21 of the 28 EU markets showed growth, this wasn’t enough to compensate for the British losses,” the trade body said in a new report. British solar firms have been hit by a round of subsidy cuts in 2015 and 2016, as well as changes to business rates for buildings with rooftop solar. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: “Tory policies on solar including dramatic cuts to feed-in tariff subsidies, business and VAT rate hikes, and obstruction to clean power auctions have held back one of the cleanest, cheapest forms of energy.” The UK currently sits third in the EU for total installed solar, but growth is expected to lag far behind other member states over the next four years. By 2022, SolarPowerEurope forecasts the UK will add just 2.1GW of solar, while Germany will add 20GW, France 11.7GW and Spain 8.8GW. Turkey was Europe’s brightest solar spot last year, recording “gigantic growth” of 30%, driven by Istanbul’s renewable energy targets. For the first time, China installed more than half of the of solar power capacity added worldwide in 2017. A separate report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicted on Tuesday that the falling costs of wind and solar power would see the technologies grow to provide half of global electricity generation by 2050."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/apr/26/monday-briefing-academy-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-26T05:17:04Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: Oscar wins for Hopkins, Fennell and Kaluuya","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/26/monday-briefing-academy-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/apr/26/monday-briefing-academy-awards","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: Oscar wins for Hopkins, Fennell and Kaluuya","bodyText":"Top story: Hopkins is oldest-ever best actor winner Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today. Anthony Hopkins, Emerald Fennell and Daniel Kaluuya claimed Oscar wins for Britain at the Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles on a night dominated by the on-the-road drama Nomadland. In a surprise victory, Hopkins won his second best actor award for his lead role in the dementia drama The Father, although he did not appear at the strangely subdued ceremony in person or by video link. Fennell was there to accept her Oscar for best original screenplay for Promising Young Woman, which she also directed. “He’s so heavy and so cold,” she said as she accepted the famous statuette, while Daniel Kaluuya’s best supporting actor for Judas and the Black Messiah made it a triple triumph for British talent. It was, however, Nomadland’s night. Its director, Chloé Zhao, started the gold rush by becoming the first woman of colour and only the second woman ever to win best director. Accepting the prize, Beijing-born Zhao said: “This is for anyone who has the faith and courage to hold on to the goodness in themselves and in each other. This is for you; you inspire me to keep going.” The already widely acclaimed film then won best picture, and Frances McDormand claimed a remarkable third Oscar for her lead role. In another first marking greater diversity at the Oscars, Mia Neal and Jamika Wilson became the first black women to win an Oscar for hair and makeup for their work on the Netflix film Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. The South Korean actor Youn Yuh-jung won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Minari, and also contributed some of the night’s pithiest quotes. The Guardian claimed its first ever Oscar by winning best documentary short for Colette, a film about a former French resistance fighter’s visit to the concentration camp where her brother was murdered during the war. Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief, Guardian News &amp; Media said: “This Academy Award is a real honour and a fantastic achievement for everyone behind this powerful and deeply moving documentary.” Check out who wore what on the red carpet at our picture gallery, and here’s the full list of winners. * * * Leaks row – Labour has called on Boris Johnson to clarify what he said to Manchester United boss Ed Woodward about the European Super League plans when they had a brief meeting at No 10 days before the breakaway was announced. As the storm around Dominic Cummings’s accusations of unethical behaviour in Downing Street continued, reports have claimed that Woodward was given the “wrong impression” that the PM supported the idea for a new league of elite clubs. No 10 denied Johnson had any knowledge of the plans. But Labour said Johnson has a case to answer over what “exactly was promised to Manchester United”. The opposition has also called for the Electoral Commission to summon Johnson and Cummings to give evidence about claims the PM sought loans from donors to do up his Downing Street flat. The government has dismissed the claims as a “stream of allegations”. Catch up here on all you need to know about the row and the so-called “chatty rat” leaks. And in more fallout from the Greensill lobbying scandal, the cabinet secretary Simon Case is expected to use his appearance in front of MPs today to announce a new inquiry into civil servants taking second jobs. * * * Covid ‘insult’ – Bereaved families of coronavirus victims have described the government’s decision that it is too busy to start an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic as an “insult”. The people who would be required to give evidence at such a statutory inquiry were “working round the clock” on tackling the virus and the vaccination rollout, the families have been told in a six-page letter, and it would not be “appropriate” for them to be diverted.

The UK has sent ventilators and oxygen to India to help the country deal with its devastating wave of Covid-19. Amid fears that people are hoarding supplies in their homes, India recorded another new global record of 352,991 new cases today. * * * Parent trap – Britain’s shared parental leave scheme is failing to redress gender inequality and should be replaced with a “use it or lose it” period of paid leave for mothers and fathers, according to campaigners, trade unions and economists. Very low take-up rates among eligible couples – estimated as low as 2% – have undermined the system introduced by the coalition government six years ago. Campaigners are proposing a new model of parental leave which would give both parents non-transferable paid leave to care for their child. * * * Refugee lawsuit – Greece has been accused of a shocking pushback against refugees at sea in a lawsuit filed at the European court of human rights. The suit says that after a migrant vessel got into difficulties off Crete last year armed commandos forced the passengers onto lifeboats. They were then towed out of Greek waters and abandoned at sea without food, water, life jackets or any means to call for help. * * * Island story – Mauro Morandi, a man known as Italy’s Robinson Crusoe, is leaving the island off Sardinia where he has lived alone for 30 years after finally surrendering to pressure from authorities to leave and will be moving to a small apartment.

Record high levels of vacancies are also likely to persist for longer than previously expected as the jobs market adjusts to changes in the economy brought on by the pandemic, said Ben Broadbent, the central bank’s deputy governor with responsibility for monetary policy. Economists have cut their forecasts for the UK economy, warning that the Omicron variant and supply chain disruption will weigh on growth. Growth at UK construction companies has hit a four-month high, as builders report that supply chain problems have eased. UK car sales grew in November, led by rising demand for electric vehicles, but were still nearly a third below their pre-pandemic levels. But German factories have suffered a sharp fall in orders, down 6.9%, driven by a tumble in overseas demand. Markets have rallied, with investors hopeful that the Omicron variant will not be severe enough to derail the recovery. But Tesla shares were hit by a report that the SEC has opened a probe into whether it properly disclosed fire risks with its solar power systems. Strike action at Tesco could lead to empty shelves in the run-up to Christmas, the Unite trade union has said, after its members voted to walk out unless they are offered a pay deal that keeps pace with inflation. Tributes have poured in for John Barton, the chairman of the fashion chain Ted Baker and the former chair of easyJet and Next, after his death was announced this morning. As Helena Feltham, the senior independent director at Ted Baker, put it: John combined a generosity of spirit with insight, humility and humour, and we will all miss him. He led the board with great skill and it was a privilege to have worked with him. Our hearts go out to his family. The vice-chair of Yorkshire Building Society is facing a call to resign over her role pushing through the sale of the fellow member-owned firm LV= to a US private equity buyer, amid concerns that it could kickstart a wave of demutualisation. This year is on course to be the strongest for home-buying activity since 2006, according to the main trade body for UK banks. UK Finance said while the first few months of the pandemic, during which the property market shut down for a time, led to predictions that sales would slump, the reality was very different, with “Covid-era activity set to eclipse everything since the credit crunch”. Despite worries about the pandemic, the owner of the Real Greek and Franco Manca restaurant chains has said that business is booming … … as is demand for Hollywood blockbuster Spider-Man: No Way Home. Goodnight. GW European stock markets have ended the day sharply higher, as investors hope that Omicron will not be as severe a threat as feared. The UK’s FTSE 100 index has closed nearly 110 points higher, or 1.5% up, at 7,232, its highest level since the market tumbles over a week ago. Airline group IAG jumped 8%, with gambling group Flutter gaining 6%, and jet engine maker Rolls-Royce finishing 3.8% higher. Investors were cheered by the White House’s chief medical adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, who said on Sunday that preliminary data about the severity of the Covid omicron variant is “a bit encouraging”. Europe’s Stoxx 600 gained around 1.4%. Oil had a strong day too, with Brent crude up almost 3% tonight. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: It’s been a positive start to the week for the FTSE 100, and European markets more generally as concerns over the Omicron variant continue to diminish on further evidence of mild symptoms and so far, no deaths reported because of getting the virus. The biggest beneficiaries are in travel and leisure with British Airways owner IAG shrugging off the tighter rules around testing and quarantine, on reports that the EU could consider easing Omicron travel restrictions to South Africa in the next week or so. BP and Shell are seeing decent gains on the back of the recovery in the oil price, as both approach three-week highs. Shares in electric carmaker Tesla have fallen 3.5% today, following a report that the SEC has opened an inquiry into whether it properly disclosed fire risks with its solar power systems. Reuters has the story: The US securities regulator has opened an investigation into Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) over a whistleblower complaint that the company failed to properly notify its shareholders and the public of fire risks associated with solar panel system defects over several years, according to a letter from the agency. The probe raises regulatory pressure on the world’s most valuable automaker, which already faces a federal safety probe into accidents involving its driver assistant systems. Concerns about fires from Tesla solar systems have been published previously, but this is the first report of investigation by the securities regulator. The US Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed the Tesla probe in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Steven Henkes, a former Tesla field quality manager, who filed a whistleblower complaint on the solar systems in 2019 and asked the agency for information about the report. “We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,” the SEC said in a response on 24 September to Henkes, declining his request to provide its records. The SEC official said the letter should not be taken as an indication by the agency that violations of law had occurred. Reuters independently confirmed the SEC letter was legitimate. Henkes, a former Toyota Motor quality division manager, was fired from Tesla in August 2020 and he sued Tesla claiming the dismissal was in retaliation for raising safety concerns. Tesla did not respond to Reuters’ emailed questions, while the SEC declined to comment. More here: Exclusive: SEC probes Tesla over whistleblower claims on solar panel defects Shares in Tesla have fallen to around $979 today, or roughly 20% off their record high last month, putting them into a bear market. Just last week, Tesla’s Elon Musk appeared to joke about whistleblowers on Twitter with the launch of a $50 (£38) stainless steel whistle … The upcoming Hollywood blockbuster Spider-Man: No Way Home is set to be a box office hit after breaking the UK record for advance ticket sales, which are being snapped up at three times the rate of those for the James Bond movie No Time to Die. Odeon, the biggest operator in the UK and Ireland with more than 120 cinemas, said it had sold many more than 200,000 tickets for the film in the first seven days since release. The rate of ticket sales to see the film, which stars British actor Tom Holland as Peter Parker, has broken the presale record set by 2019’s Avengers: Endgame. Odeon also said that the Spider-Man presales rate in the first seven days was three times that amassed by Daniel Craig’s eagerly anticipated, much delayed and final outing as James Bond. Carol Welch, the managing director of Odeon Cinemas UK and Ireland, said: As we head into the festive period, we are really pleased with the advance booking numbers for Spider-Man: No Way Home. It shows guests are loving being back at cinemas and are excited about the magic that our big screen experience brings to movies. Back in the UK, the owner of the Real Greek and Franco Manca restaurant chains has said business is booming and is ahead of pre-pandemic levels as office workers and theatregoers return to city centres. Parent company the Fulham Shore reported a doubling of revenues and a return to profit in the six months to 26 September, with many of its 75 restaurants “continuing to break weekly trading records”. “We have seen continued trading momentum in recent weeks, with revenues in October and November ahead of 2019 comparatives,” said David Page, chairman of the Fulham Shore. This includes our office and theatre district-located restaurants, which are continuing to trade positively over the four weeks in November, achieving revenues ahead of the same weeks in 2019. Speculation that the European Commission is set to propose stricter labour rules to regulate the gig economy have sent shares of companies in the sector sharply lower today. Investors fear the business models of these companies might be jeopardized should the EU’s executive arm require them to directly employ drivers and riders, Reuters reports. Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, explained: The thorny question of whether or not delivery drivers are employees is about to be answered by the EU Commission later this week and reports suggest the answer will be yes. For food delivery businesses like Deliveroo and Just Eat that could mean a huge spike in costs, costs which many expect will be passed on to consumers across central Europe. Shares in Deliveroo are down 3%, with Just Eat Takeaway diving 6.6% and Delivery Hero losing 5.5% The regulatory uncertainty about gig economy stocks was illustrated last March when a number of investment funds declined to participate in Deliveroo’s initial public offering adding pressure to the stock which plunged when it made its London debut. Deliveroo floated at 330p, but are now changing hands at just 233.50p. The New York stock exchange has made a mixed start to trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 325 points, or 0.95%, to 34,906 points. The index of 30 large US firms is rallying after posting its fourth straight weekly loss last week, for the first time since September 2020. But technology stocks are under pressure again, pulling the tech-focused Nasdaq index down by 0.5%. Fiona Cincotta, senior financial market analyst at City Index, says the prospect of higher interest rates and inflation are weighing on tech stocks [because they make the future earnings of growth stocks less valuable today] US stocks are set for a mixed start with the high tech Nasdaq under performing as Treasury yields rise. Easing Omicron fears are making way for investors to position for a more hawkish Fed. The markets are dialing back on the potential economic damage that Omicron could cause as initial reports suggest that the new Covid variant is less severe. US medical advisor Anthony Fauci said that the early signs suggest that Omicron doesn’t have a great degree of severity. His comments came as Omicron spread to around one-third of US states. Strike action at Tesco could lead to empty shelves in the run-up to Christmas, the Unite trade union has said, after its members voted to walk out unless they are offered a pay deal that keeps pace with inflation. The supermarket chain has offered staff a pay rise of 4%, which Unite has said is “offensive” given that the retail price index rate of inflation stands at 6%. The offer is also below the more commonly used consumer price index, which is at a 10-year high of 4.2%. Discussions are understood to be taking place in an effort to avert action that would add to the countrywide supply chain disruption that has already triggered warnings of shortages of food and drink at Christmas. If the company does not improve its offer, Unite said warehouse workers and HGV drivers at depots in Doncaster, Didcot, Belfast and Antrim would start a series of rolling strikes from 16 December Deutsche Bank predicts that the UK economy is slowing this quarter, as the Omicron variant hits the recovery. Sanjay Raja, Deutsche’s senior economist, predicts that October’s GDP report, due on Friday, will show growth slowed to 0.3%, from 0.6% in September Risks to the projection are finely balanced, if slightly tilted to the downside, Raja says, adding: Looking ahead, Q4 GDP growth should more clearly signal an even slower quarter after growth disappointed in Q3 (1.3% q-o-q). With supply constraints lingering, household spending easing, fiscal support waning, and the labour force remaining smaller than its pre-pandemic level, the recovery should slow further, impacted further by news of Omicron and some modest disruption from Storm Arwen. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent doesn’t know how the Omicron variant will affect his vote on UK interest rates later this month. Asked how Omicron will influence his thinking, Broadbent told his audience at Leeds University that: I go into these meetings not knowing very often what I’m going to vote myself. I think the best way to look at it is to look at our last set of forecasts, think about the economics of this, think about the data we’ve had since then. Last month Broadbent voted to leave interest rates at record lows of 0.1% - along with six other policymakers, while just two voted to hike to 0.25%. One of the latter two, Michael Saunders, suggested last week that Omicron could delay a rise in borrowing costs. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent has warned that UK inflation could be ‘comfortably’ over 5% next spring, when energy bills rise again. In a speech in Leeds, Broadbent says the UK is in an “extremely challenging period for monetary policy”. Inflation is already more than double the Monetary Policy Committee’s target, and heading higher - as regulator Ofgem is likely to lift the UK’s price cap sharply higher next April. Broadbent says: Despite relatively weak growth over the past two years as a whole, domestically and globally, inflation has risen very significantly. In this country it was over 4% in October. In the spring of next year, when the next rise in the Ofgem cap on gas and electricity bills comes through, it will probably climb comfortably through 5%, a long way north of the MPC’s 2% target. Broadbent also explains that rising goods prices, driven up by supply chain problems and high demand in the lockdown, have pushed inflation over target. He argues that those pressures on traded goods are ‘more likely to subside than intensify’ over the next couple of years. So if they are transitory, they would dissipate before any rise in interest rates (to dampen demand) had taken effect. Indeed it’s quite possible that, in a couple of years, some of these tradable goods prices will be falling, pulling down on inflation, Broadbent says. Instead, a tight labour market could be a bigger driver of inflation, if wages keep rising as firms compete for workers. Broadbent says: Although it’s possible that these strains too could pass – there’s a chance these frictions are simply the result of the sheer speed of hiring, and will ease of their own accord – there’s also an upside risk to wage costs from currently high inflation. If wage earners’ expectations of future inflation rise in response, of if they seek compensation for the rises in the costs of living that have already occurred, wages could also accelerate further, even without any additional decline in unemployment. The emergence of the new coronavirus Omicron variant is starting to impact UK shopper behaviour and deter some people from returning to the office. Researcher Springboard has reported there was a 3.8% drop in footfall in regional cities outside of London last week. And while footfall in the capital rose by +0.5%, Springboard’s “Central London Back to the Office” index dropped by 2%, suggesting some commuters have return to home working. Overall, footfall in UK retail destinations rose by +0.7% last week. Visits rose 2.3% at shopping centres and 1.3% at retail parks, but were down 0.4% at high streets. Diane Wehrle, Insights Director at Springboard, says the data provide “the first evidence of an early impact on footfall of the Omicron variant” Springboard’s Central London Back to the Office benchmark (comprising only those areas in close proximity to offices) declined last week from the week before, whilst footfall across Central London as a whole - which is clearly being supported by the Christmas trading period – increased, rising by even more in those areas with a predominance of retail stores. China’s central bank has cut the amount that banks must hold in reserve in an attempt to support its economy, as the threat of a possible Evergrande default looms. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is lowering the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks by 50 basis points (bps), from December 15th, which will release 1.2 trillion yuan (£140bn) in long-term liquidity to bolster lending, and stimulate growth. China’s economy has already lost momentum in recent months, hit by Covid-19 outbreaks, pandemic restrictions, and a slowdown in its factory sector - as well as debt problems in the property market. Elsewhere in the markets, bitcoin is under pressure after a volatile weekend. The largest cryptocurrency has dropped to around $47,500, over 11% down on Friday’s $53,595, at its lowest since early October. The slump is being blamed on the broader move away from riskier assets, due to concerns over Omicron, a weak US jobs report on Friday, and the prospect that America’s central bank ends its stimulus package earlier due to worries about inflation. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: The crypto currency is highly sensitive to the fortunes of the stock market and traders were spooked by a stock sell off in the US, following some disappointing jobs figures. The sharp fall erased the last two months of gains, yet more evidence of the highly volatile nature of the asset. Crypto coins and tokens have been propelled higher in this era of ultra cheap money and as speculation swirls about just when central banks will start further tightening mass bond buying programmes and start raising interest rates, they are likely to continue to be highly volatile. The president of El Salvador may have proudly stated his country was buying on the dip, but the perturbations at work in the crypto stratosphere, means investing in Bitcoin is not for the faint hearted or for those with no money to lose. Other crypto assets, such as ethereum, are also weaker, flags interactive investor’s Victoria Scholar: Update: Shares in China’s troubled, indebted property giant Evergrande Group closed at a record low in Hong Kong after it lurched to the brink of default (see earlier post). They finished at just $1.81 Hong Kong dollars, after warning that it cannot guarantee funds for a looming $260m guarantee obligation. That’s down from around HK$15 at the start of the year, before fears over its debt mountain grew. Growth in Britain’s construction industry hit its strongest pace in four months in November, as delays obtaining materials such as timber eased. Data firm IHS Markit reports there was a sharp increase in business activity at building firms last month. It was led by an upturn in commercial work, as the economic recovery led to new projects and infrastructure work. Encouragingly, the proportion of firms reporting longer delivery times fell to 47% in November, from a peak of 77% in June, according to Markit’s latest survey of purchasing managers. Port delays and a severe lack of transport availability due to haulage driver shortages did still hold back suppliers, but firms noted an improvement in the availability of specific items (especially timber). Prices kept rising, although at the slowest rate since April with 72% of firms reporting an increase in purchase prices in November, while only 3% a decline. Tim Moore, director at IHS Markit, says UK builders saw a welcome combination of faster output growth and softer price inflation last month. “Input price inflation remains extremely strong by any measure, but it has started to trend downwards after hitting multi-decade peaks this summer. The latest rise in purchasing costs was the slowest since April, helped by a gradual turnaround in supply chain disruption and a slight slowdown in input buying. Port congestion and severe shortages of haulage capacity were again the most commonly cited reasons for longer lead times for construction products and materials.” Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says supply chains seem to be improving, given the fall in companies reporting longer waiting times. Even with this glimmer of hope that the pressure on deliveries was easing, purchasing remained at higher level to counteract disruptions from ongoing driver shortages and port delays as supply chain managers bought more than their immediate need. Job hiring growth was still maintained in November but was the weakest since March. Builder optimism was somewhat flat as the costs of building still remained high and firms struggled to stay competitive.” Britain is failing to roll out enough public charging points to match the growing demand for electric cars, the SMMT adds. The number of plug-in cars potentially sharing a public on-street charger jumped from 11 in 2019 to 16 in 2020. That 16:1 ratio is much worse than other major economies, such as South Korea (3:1), the Netherlands (5:1), China (9:1), France (10:1), Belgium and Japan (both 13:1). The situation hasn’t improved this year, with just one standard on-street public charger installed for every 52 new plug-in cars registered in the first nine month of the year. With plug-in vehicle uptake having grown by 86.6% in 2021, SMMT is calling on the government to take action to avoid the ratio deteriorating further, through binding targets to rollout more public charging points. SMMT CEO Mike Hawes says: The continued acceleration of electrified vehicle registrations is good for the industry, the consumer and the environment but, with the pace of public charging infrastructure struggling to keep up, we need swift action and binding public charger targets so that everyone can be part of the electric vehicle revolution, irrespective of where they live.” Shortages of semiconductors continue to hit UK car sales, industry body SMMT warns. It just reported that sales of new cars in the UK rose by 1.7% year-on-year in November to 115,706, the first monthly rise since June. That still left registrations nearly a third below their pre-pandemic five-year average, with chip shortages hampering the supply of new cars to forecourts. More motorists turned to electric cars last month; the number of battery electric vehicle registrations more than doubled year-on-year to 21,726. Overall, plug-in cars represented 28.1% of market in November, with 10,796 plug-in hybrids also sold. Sales to individuals jumped by 41.7% compared to November 2020, when England was entering its second lockdown. However, the number of new cars registered to large fleets declined by nearly a quarter. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “What looks like a positive performance belies the underlying weakness of the market. Demand is there, with a slew of new, increasingly electrified, models launched but the global shortage of semiconductors continues to bedevil production and therefore new car registrations. The industry is working flat out to overcome these issues and fulfil orders, but disruption is likely to last into next year, compounding the need for customers to place orders early. John Barton, the chairman of the fashion chain Ted Baker and the former chair of easyJet and Next, has died. Ted Baker said the veteran businessman, who was appointed non-executive chairman of the troubled fashion retailer last year, died suddenly. “John was a source of great wisdom for me and for so many of us at Ted Baker and we will hugely miss his support and guidance,” said Rachel Osborne, the chief executive of Ted Baker, who joined a month before Barton’s appointment in April 2020. “Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with his wife, Anne, and their family.” Last week, the 77-year-old stood down as chairman of easyJet, ending a near nine-year stint during the most tumultuous period in the low-cost airline’s 26-year history. Barton last year weathered an attempted ousting by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the airline’s founder and largest shareholder, who threatened to requisition a series of shareholder meetings after the coronavirus pandemic hit to force easyJet to abandon £4.5bn of planes from Airbus he believed would bankrupt the business. At an extraordinary general meeting, Barton came through an attempt to oust him, winning 58% of the vote. “I am truly shocked and extremely saddened to hear of John’s passing,” said Johan Lundgren, the chief executive of easyJet. “I was very fortunate to have worked closely with him over the years and benefited greatly from his wise counsel. He was a man of huge integrity who was very much liked and respected by everyone across the airline. On behalf of all of his former colleagues at easyJet, we send our heartfelt sympathies to John’s family at this time. He will be greatly missed.” Stephen Hester, the former boss of Royal Bank of Scotland who took over from Barton as the chairman of easyJet, said he was a “distinguished chair who made an outstanding contribution to the company” and was “also a wonderful human being”. The eurozone construction sector saw its fastest rise in activity in nearly four years in November, despite rising concerns over the pandemic. Output and new orders both increased during the month, according to the latest survey of building firms across the euro area from data firm IHS Markit, with construction activity rising at a series record pace in Italy. There was a sustained rise in home building activity, as well as a second successive rise in commercial construction, but civil engineering work fell again. However, the report also found that severe supply chain delays kept pushing up builders’ costs, while business confidence fell to a seven-month low. Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, said: Notably, input costs continued to increase at a substantial pace amid ongoing severe supply chain disruption. These lingering issues weighed on business sentiment, with the degree of optimism regarding the year-ahead outlook easing to the softest since April. At the national level, Italian firms reported a tenth consecutive rise in activity that was the sharpest on record, while firms in France noted the quickest expansion since June 2020. At the same time, German firms signalled a sustained fall in activity, albeit one that was the softest for 15 months.” There are early signs the UK’s shortage of lorry drivers could improve, which could help with the supply chain crisis next year. Logistics UK, which represents freight and haulage businesses, said the number of drivers leaving the profession had begun to ease, and that more trainees are coming through the testing system. In a new report, Logistics UK shows that there were 44,000 fewer HGV drivers this autumn than in 2019, But, the number of HGV driver tests is up 25%, along with a three-fold increase in applications for vocational provisional licenses. Elizabeth de Jong, policy director at Logistics UK, said the sector was seeing “green shoots” of recovery, and that HGV driver numbers should improve as new trainees join the sector. “It is still a challenging time, there is still an acute shortage of drivers certainly but there a number of signs of improvement that could be coming.” “We’re seeing hope that more people are beginning to enter the industry, but we’ve got to keep attracting them by really improving the facilities.” Shares of China’s Evergrande Group have tumbled to a record low on Monday on fears that the property giant it is on the verge of a potentially disastrous default, and could be forced into a full-blown restructuring. Evergrande’s shares slumped by up to 19.5% in Hong Kong trading, after the firm said there was no guarantee it would have enough funds to meet debt repayments. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: The company has lurched from one crisis to another in recent months as it faced a series of repayments on debts – three times waiting until the last possible moment to stump up the cash needed to stay afloat. But a statement from the company over the weekend said that there was “no guarantee” that the group could meet its obligations and added that creditors had demanded immediate repayment of a total of $260m (£196m). Its most pressing problem is how to repay $82.5m due on Monday – a deadline pushed back 30 days when it failed to meet the obligation on the due date back in November. “Since September 2021, the group has been diligently reviewing its capital structure and liquidity condition with the help of its financial and legal advisors, evaluating all available strategic options, and maintaining ongoing dialogue with offshore creditors,” said the statement. Electricity prices are continuing to surge across Europe, as the colder weather drives up demand: Oil prices have jumped over 2% this morning, after top exporter Saudi Arabia raised some of its crude prices despite the threat of Omicron to the recovery. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: “Brent crude and West Texas are both trading higher by more than 2% after Saudi Arabia increase its crude prices to Asia and the US over the weekend for the second month in a row. The global oil benchmark is trading back above $71 a barrel while WTI remains below $70, having broken below the threshold almost a week ago. Last week OPEC+ stuck with the plan to increase supplies by 400,00 barrels per day in January. After enjoying eight consecutive weeks of gains, the tide turned for oil in October with Brent crude suffering six straight weeks in the red. Investors are now digesting the threat of Omicron and the knock-on impact for oil demand. Monday’s bullish price action suggests that oil is attempting to rally off the lows with the potential for a more positive week ahead.” European stock markets have started the new week on the front foot, as investors try to shake off worries about Omicron. The UK’s FTSE 100 index has jumped by 45 points, or 0.65%, to 7168 points. Travel and hospitality firms are in the risers, with InterContinental Hotels gaining 1.6%, IAG, which owns British Airways, are up 1.75%. Primark owner AB Foods has gained 1.5%, while oil giants BP (+1.2%) and Royal Dutch Shell (+1.1%) are benefitting from a rise in crude prices this morning. The pan-European Stoxx 600 has gained 0.8%. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, explains that hopes that omicron is a milder variant is boosting the markets. US equity index futures are performing another omicron U-turn this morning, limiting the fallout in Asian markets of another fairly gruesome Wall Street session on Friday. The driver of the whip-saw return of serve omicron headline tennis comes from South Africa, where an article from the South African Medical Research Council, suggests that omicron symptoms were milder than previous incarnations, with hospitalised patients mostly having comorbidities. Of course, the sample size is small, but markets never let “the data” these days get in the way of narrative. Omicron variant milder = U-turn = buy everything. But... South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has warned today that hospitals are preparing for more admissions, as the Omicron variant pushes the country into a fourth wave of Covid-19 infections. Our Covid-19 liveblog has more details. Supply-chain problems, rising costs and on-going COVID-19 restrictions could lead to shortages of goods and services and higher prices over the Christmas trading period, UK businesses fear. New research from accountancy firm BDO found that 80% of medium-sized business leaders expect their end of year trading to be impacted by rising fuel prices, supply chain disruption or increasing energy costs (or a combination of these threats). Ed Dwan, partner at BDO, warned that Omicron could hinder firms’ recovery plans. “Following a year of disruption, many businesses will have been hoping for a strong finish to 2021 and a fresh start for 2022. The harsh reality is that continued supply chain issues, rising energy prices and increasing costs means that many are taking further drastic measures to stay afloat. These issues could also be further exacerbated by the new COVID-19 variant. The 6.9% slump in new order at German factories in October shows that supply chain woes are hitting industry, says Carsten Brzeski of ING: Today’s industrial orders data is a cold shower for German industry. When the global economy came out of the 2020/21 winter lockdown, German industrial orders jumped to unprecedented levels, growing on average by more than 2% per month. At the end of the summer, however, orders collapsed and dropped by more than 12% between July and October. The sharp collapse over the summer is increasingly leaving its mark on industry - a reflection perhaps of ongoing supply chain frictions and companies simply delaying new orders or, worse, cancelling orders, knowing that delivery times are long anyway. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics says October’s factory orders are terrible: We also have bad economic news from Germany this morning. Factory orders at Europe’s largest economy tumbled by 6.9% in October, much worse than expected, after a 1.8% rise in September. Orders were 1% lower than in October 2020, the first year-on-year drop since September 2020, in the latest sign that Germany’s recovery is faltering at the end of 2021. German manufacturers were hit by weaker overseas demand, figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed. Foreign orders slumped by 13.1% month-on-month, including a 3.2% drop in new orders from the euro area, while domestic orders rose by 3.4%. The CBI is also gloomier about the UK’s economic outlook. It has cut its growth forecasts for the UK’s growth this year to 6.9%, from 8.2% previously, and to 5.1% for 2022, down from 6.1%. The downgrade mostly reflected weaker growth since its last forecasts in June, with supply chain problems continuing to bite. With global supply chain problems hitting the economy, the CBI says the government must take fresh action to a steep fall in business investment in 2023, when temporary measures to help business are withdrawn CBI’s director general, Tony Danker, says: “We should be raising our sights on the economy’s potential and seizing the moment. I know from speaking with firms of all sizes that they have an ambitious investment mindset and are anxious to implement growth plans. “But while intentions have thawed, we’re coming up to a cliff edge in 2023.” Here’s the full story: Here are KPMG’s three scenarios for how Omicron could hit the recovery next year: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The UK’s economic outlook looks less bright this morning, as shortages, rising costs, and the possibility of more Covid restrictions all threaten growth. KPMG has warned that GDP growth could more than halve next year if more restrictions are introduced to combat Omicron, depending on the severity of the new variant. In its central scenario, the UK government would bring back social distancing restrictions in retail and hospitality venues, and encourages people to work from home if they can in January and February 2022. If that happened, the economy would contract around 2% in the first quarter of 2022, slowing overall growth next year to 2.6%, down from 6.7% this year. In KPMG’s downside scenario, the threat of a significant rise in acute Covid-19 cases triggers another lockdown in early 2022. That would trigger a sharp fall in GDP, around 4.2%, in January-March 2022, dragging growth next year down to just 1.8%. While growth momentum is expected to decelerate until a booster is rolled out to halt the rise in cases, the full impact of the new variant will depend on the rise in the number of acute Covid cases and any social distancing restrictions that are introduced, it explains. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, says: “The Omicron variant has elevated the level of uncertainty about the recovery path from the pandemic. While the impact is not expected to be as severe as at the start of the pandemic, or even the beginning of this year, increased uncertainty and the potential reintroduction of social distancing measures could see output fall this month and during the first quarter of 2022.” Some sectors may remain significantly impacted by the pandemic, compared with the overall economy, the report adds: Additional travel restrictions and new pandemic hot spots are expected to see a slower and more protracted recovery in the sector. Rail travel will also be affected by a slower return of commuters to their workplaces. Commuter footfall was still down by 22% in late November compared to pre-pandemic levels and is likely to fall as people are encouraged to work from home. KPMG also warns that supply chains would come under more pressure, if the pandemic again leads to more demand for goods from locked-down consumers. Labour shortages have become a significant impediment to growth, it adds, as well as pushing up wages.

This is a novel not just about a machine but narrated by a machine, though the word is not used about her until late in the book when it is wielded by a stranger as an insult. People distrust and then start to like her: “Are you alright, Klara?” Apart from the occasional lapse into bullying or indifference, humans are solicitous of Klara’s feelings – if that is what they are. Klara is built to observe and understand humans, and these actions are so close to empathy they may amount to the same thing. “I believe I have many feelings,” she says. “The more I observe the more feelings become available to me.” Klara is an AF, or artificial friend, who is bought as a companion for 14-year-old Josie, a girl suffering from a mysterious, perhaps terminal illness. Klara is loyal and tactful, she is able to absorb difficulty and return care. Her role, as she describes it, is to prevent loneliness and to serve. So we, the readers, love Klara the way we love what is good. We love her the way we loved our childhood teddy bear, perhaps, or even in the way we love a fictional character. Because even the most rounded fictional character is also a kind of animated doll; a code made out of language and the readers’ goodwill, which makes us smile or cry because we believe in it. The credulity of the reader is a hopeful and sometimes beautiful thing. Klara and the Sun captures this poignancy exactly – not because of the way people believe in Klara, but because of the way she starts to believe in the sun. The themes of replication and authenticity are similar to those in Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go, published in 2005. Both novels are set in a speculative future that feels quite like the present. Both also contain a secret moral shift: an advance in technology that has changed people’s sense of what it is to be human, and the emotional punch of Klara, as with Never Let Me Go, comes from the fact that the central character doesn’t know what is going on. At the start of the novel, we see Klara being moved into the window display of her store in the city in order to attract customers (Ishiguro makes this less pervy than it sounds), and she speaks in gentle tones about what she sees outside. Klara is already a little self-conscious, for a machine. She is also an exceptionally talented AF, because she is able to grasp emotional contradiction. Out in the street, a man and a woman see each other, perhaps for the first time in many years, and they embrace so tightly Klara wonders if they are more upset than delighted. “Sometimes,” her manager says, “at special moments like that, people feel a pain alongside their happiness.” She has already seen Josie, the girl whose friend she instantly wants to become, but Josie has not come back to make the purchase. Klara must wait, which she does with great patience. Ishiguro is very interested in delay and restoration. Loneliness and waiting are almost the same thing here; estrangements and reunifications run through the book. Josie reconciles with her old friend Rick, she meets her separated father, and Rick’s mother makes contact with an old boyfriend, Vance. The promise is held out that those who wait will be rewarded, and sometimes they are. Other times, the reality is disappointing or even brutal, but win or lose, hope is such a sustaining thing that it becomes a value in itself. Hope, in the face of sickness and possible death, is what Klara does best. Meanwhile, the reader must learn to wait too, as with steady craft, Ishiguro leaves one hint after another. What is wrong with the world outside Klara’s store window? Why are the children she sees so thin? Why does the beggar man seem dead (along with his dog) and then alive again? What will happen when humans realise that the new upgraded series of AFs are capable of deceitfulness? The book rustles with possibility. By the time we realise what is happening to the children, this first mystery has given way to the more urgent question of what Josie’s mother is planning for Klara. If you are waiting for a big sci-fi reveal about this future world then you are reading the wrong book, however. There is no great veil ripped from the narrative to reveal a conspiracy of machines, or of men. Social and political details come late, and make no difference to Klara. Slowly, however, our understanding of the world detaches from her naive point of view. We come to know more than Klara does, and this distance is the gentle opposite of irony – it is compassion. The novel requires the reader to ask and settle, over and again, while the philosophical content quietly takes hold. Klara and the Sun is a book about what it is to be human. The fact that Ishiguro can make such huge concerns seem so essential and so simple is just one of the reasons he was awarded the Nobel prize. How does a robot become conscious? Klara runs on solar power and is fretful when the world goes grey. The absence of light, she says, might make an AF “start to worry there was something wrong with him”. Klara’s need for the sun is so close to an emotion as to make no difference. The sun is “goodness”, she says, it provides “special nourishment” and – as easily as that – both abstraction and magical thinking are engendered in the mind of a machine. When Klara looks at the sky the light can be lemon or slate grey, but when Josie is sick, it turns to the colour “of her vomit or her pale feces”. Klara is generating symbolism, she is making meaning and taking solace from what might be called a “psychology”. This finally yields a spiritual sense, when she starts to bargain for Josie’s health, or when she decides to make a sacrifice, in order to make Josie better. Klara starts to pray. Ishiguro is at his most moving when he writes about the meek. It is almost concerning how ready the female characters in the book are to be sacrificed to some greater aim, to suffer or be punished. When a woman tries to strike a bargain with a cruel authority figure, she takes it one step further: “You can check if I have been punishing myself properly,” she says. The men in the novel are, by contrast, more rebellious and free. Klara’s naivety is the engine of the book and its great strength, but we might query why the humans seem to know so little and be so trusting too. When Klara asks for assistance in the task she has set herself to save Josie, no one turns her down. “I don’t see how this helps Josie,” says Rick, “but if you say it will, then of course I’ll help.” This same avowal is repeated, more strangely, by Josie’s father, though his motives are less clear. There are questions the reader might ask, in this as well as in any other novel that is set after the invention of the internet. Why does Klara not talk to Siri, if she wants to know what is going on in the wider world, or sometimes even what is going on in front of her? Other questions linger, in a more fruitful way, after the novel is finished. Would people risk making their children sick, you wonder, in order to help them get ahead in the world? In fact, people do all kinds of awful things to their children, for exactly that reason. Ishiguro’s simplicity here, as elsewhere, yields serious speculation. There is something so steady and beautiful about the way Klara is always approaching connection, like a Zeno’s arrow of the heart. People will absolutely love this book, in part because it enacts the way we learn how to love. Klara and the Sun is wise like a child who decides, just for a little while, to love their doll. “What can children know about genuine love?” Klara asks. The answer, of course, is everything. • Klara and the Sun is published by Faber (£20). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

The company announced a pilot phase for the new scheme, which also includes installation of charging stations at customers’ homes, to cover Sydney and Melbourne. The industry group the Electric Vehicle Council, which last month announced sales of electric vehicles had tripled between 2018 and 2019, said AGL’s move was a glimpse into the future of the electric vehicle market. AGL said it hoped the subscription service, available only to its own customers, would remove the barriers for people to drive electric cars – namely, the high upfront costs and the desire for a charging station at home. Under the service, subscribers pay an $800 set-up fee and then a weekly price for a car starting at $299 that includes the installation of a charging station as well as insurance, maintenance and registration. The AGL executive John Chambers told Guardian Australia the company was looking ahead at the rapid growth of electric vehicles and the role the vehicle’s batteries could play to store energy at homes as well as power vehicles. “That is a frontier for us,” he said. The car batteries were typically six or seven times the size of the residential batteries people installed to store their solar power. Several models of car will be available under the service, AGL said, including Nissan, Tesla, Jaguar and Hyundai. Customers would not be locked into a contract. AGL said the electricity used to charge the batteries would be carbon-neutral through offsets purchased under a government-accredited scheme. Last month AGL announced all its 400 corporate vehicles would be electric by 2030. The company is Australia’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases and has a target to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. In June the company announced it would be linking manager bonuses to its climate targets. The Melbourne-based company JET Charge will install the charging stations for AGL’s subscription scheme. JET Charge’s chief executive, Tim Washington, said the stations can recharge a car battery three times faster than a standard socket and complete a full recharge overnight. “The greatest way to get someone to purchase an electric vehicle is to just get them to try it,” he told Guardian Australia. “So this is a fantastic way for people to be able to try before they buy.” He said energy utility companies in other countries had also set up electric vehicle subscription services and AGL’s move was an example of how the energy market would converge around electric vehicles. He said energy companies were increasingly seeing electric vehicles as a way to store energy that could be fed back into the electricity grid. Washington said JET Charge had grown from employing one electrician in 2014 to a business with 40 staff and 150 contractors that had installed 4,500 charging stations. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, he said, the company was installing about 20 electric charging stations a day. Behyad Jafari, the chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council that represents major car brands and infrastructure companies including JET Charge, told Guardian Australia that upfront costs were a major barrier to people driving electric vehicles. “This is going to make electric vehicles available to more consumers,” he said of AGL’s plan. “More than half of all consumers say they want to buy an electric vehicle but the high upfront price gets in the way.” He said the subscription service for electric vehicles “hints at what the future of this market looks like”, with car sharing and ride sharing schemes also focusing on electric cars. Even though electric vehicles sales tripled in Australia from 2018 to 2019, the 6,718 sold in 2019 only represents 0.6% of new car sales. Jafari said 3,226 electric vehicles had been sold in 2020 up to the end of June. Sales in 2020 may not grow from 2019, he said, but he expected they would be steady when sales of non-electric vehicles were falling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/apr/19/my-life-in-weed-cannabis-oregon-culture","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-19T07:00:25Z","webTitle":"My life in weed: from hippies and Swat teams to boardrooms and trade mags","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/19/my-life-in-weed-cannabis-oregon-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/apr/19/my-life-in-weed-cannabis-oregon-culture","fields":{"headline":"My life in weed: from hippies and Swat teams to boardrooms and trade mags","bodyText":"In the beginning, there was weed. My dad and I would walk down the gravel road and up a path through the woods to his patch, where the plants were partially hidden by a canopy of maples. It wasn’t an ideal spot for sunlight, but it was an ideal spot for hiding. My dad would carry bags of fertilizer on foot for a mile so that our truck was never spotted in the vicinity. In the fall my parents would harvest, and my mom would hang flat baskets in our living room to dry the pungent branches. Our house suffused with the smell of cannabis, and we’d sit in front of our little black-and-white television and snip the branches into salable pounds. At age four, I had my own tiny pair of scissors for trimming. I doubt I was much help, but I felt very important. We lived in the Oregon Coast Range, in a wooded valley known for weed. Like most of our hippy neighbors, my parents were craftspeople who grew a crop to keep their small business afloat. Our community produced candles, wooden puzzles, goat cheese, tie-dye, woven ponchos, silver jewelry and Acapulco Gold. No one was getting rich, but growing enabled a way of life not built around the 9 to 5. We all paid a harsh price for that freedom. Driving the product out of state for sale was a mission fraught with danger, and at home we lived in fear of police raids; daily life buzzed with a low-level paranoia that ramped up if we heard a helicopter overhead. Us kids were raised to believe that Nancy Reagan was wrong, our parents were right, weed wasn’t bad and cops were the enemy. That latter point was hammered home at a family barbecue in 1984. My dad was grilling chicken and chatting with my grandmother while my cousins and I played tag in the yard. I was the first to spot the Swat team –uniformed men with big guns advancing up our driveway. Everything happened very quickly: they held the adults at gunpoint and ransacked the house. As they handcuffed my dad, my cousin Jose started screaming hysterically because he thought they were actually cutting off Steve’s hands. After that, my fear of the police metastasized and I didn’t have any desire to be involved in the illicit industry. I resisted the lure of “easy money” until 2008, when the economy tanked. My husband was laid off, and I simultaneously lost a lucrative writing job. When a friend offered us temporary work at his cannabis farm in Humboldt county, we packed our battered Honda and headed south. I landed in the Emerald Triangle at the apex of the green rush. The vague wording of California’s 1996 medical cannabis law had given growers a measure of protection from the police, and the later passage of the cheekily named Senate Bill 420, which lowered the penalty for selling weed from a felony to a misdemeanor, encouraged further expansion. Once a haven of old hippies, Humboldt began attracting another breed of growers who were in it to go big and get rich. Rural communities grew into boom towns, the big illegal grows sucked streams dry, and fertilizer runoff caused algae blooms in the Eel River. From the get-go, the place was a shock to me. My childhood among family-oriented Oregon growers did nothing to prepare me for the flagrant lawlessness of Humboldt. I wasn’t prepared for the garbage bags of money, the pot plants the size of sheds – or the guns. The night we arrived it was pouring buckets, turning the rutted mountain roads into slicks of red mud. Outdoor growers live in fear of the freak rainstorms that can destroy the crop before it matures, and my friend was in a frenzy. We worked on treacherous hillsides until we were soaked to the bone, hauling and hanging plants the size of trees. After we cut down the plants, it was our job to process the dried branches. A lot of people thought it was cool to be surrounded by so much weed, but I didn’t. I didn’t find weed romantic and I hated trimming. Resin gummed up my scissors and burnt my eyes. We couldn’t sit outside because of helicopter surveillance, so we worked in a filthy shack, 14-hour days, seven days a week. I developed carpal tunnel syndrome and an allergy that puffed up my face and impaired my vision. We were off the grid and out of cell range. Hundreds of pounds piled up around us. It wasn’t mine, but I had no way of proving that. I had a residual fear of police raids and spent a lot of time planning escape routes. I kept my purse on me at all times in case I had to run for it. The work was boring, but we had company – a trio of Australian DJs, a brilliant photographer, a pretentious bartender, a friend who was financing her ecotourism business. Like my parents, people were working to support some other dream. (The Pacific north-west is rich with niche restaurants, galleries and esoteric bars that wouldn’t exist without the pipeline of money that came out of the illicit cannabis market in the 1990s and 2000s.) In its heyday, Humboldt represented the flip sides of anarchy. On one hand you had gun-toting “grow-bros” who were destroying the local ecology in the name of the bottom line, and on the other hand you had your old hippies in precious knit caps rambling about their cannabis genetics, their commitment to solar power and their vision for a self-sufficient society. But the old hippies weren’t totally full of shit: prohibition created an outlaw world with its own systems of governance. In rural communities bereft of tax dollars, the legacy growers maintained their own roads, supported local schools and community centers, and ran their own radio station, the legendary KMUD, which broadcast reports of police activity so everyone could prepare for possible raids. The Humboldt of my youth was a society created by the imposed condition of prohibition and embodied both the joy and the darkness of life outside the law. On a good day, those mountains could feel like Utopia. Weed wasn’t the only thing that grew well. The gardens yielded giant tomatoes, skeins of nasturtium, sunflowers waving at blue California skies. On Sundays, we’d ride ATVs over to a hidden valley where work crews congregated to play twilight volleyball and pass the world’s finest joints. Everyone was a self-proclaimed artist, and the culture had an air of creative largesse. In California, growers feared legalization more than they feared the cops. They said if weed went legal, everyone would be smoking Philip Morris joints they bought at 7-11 and we’d all be out of a job. Their fears were founded. California voters finally bit the bullet and legalized cannabis in 2016. I was one of the lucky ones. Weed money had bought me time to build my writing career. When trimming was no longer lucrative, I could afford to put down my scissors for good. My days of cold sweats and paranoia were behind me. I thought my weed days were over too, but a seemingly innocent assignment for a grow magazine led to another, and one day I woke up a cannabis writer. Today I’m the editor of MJ Brand Insights, “a news and intel site for cannabis industry professionals”. I have healthcare, I spend my day in Zoom meetings and my salary exceeds what I made in the illicit market. As I study corporate acquisitions and write about cannabis-infused seltzer, I’ve learned that the old growers were right about a number of things: Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, has indeed invested in cannabis. And the exacting permitting process made it impossible for most of the original growers to adapt their farms to the legal market. The people who developed the genetics that made north-western weed the best on earth were cut out of the business – as were the communities of color that had been hardest hit by the war on drugs. Despite these very serious flaws, I don’t mourn the old days. The illicit industry may have had an outlaw romance, but a lot of people were just in it for the money at any cost. I appreciate the protection of labor and environmental laws. I no longer have to worry about dealing with pesticide-covered weed or working until my hands feel like they’re going to fall off. Or Swat teams. When I accepted my current job, I worried that I’d spend my days interviewing corporate schmucks. But I was surprised to discover that the legal industry is more interesting than the illicit industry. For every corporate bro, there’s five people who are here because they’re civil liberties warriors or true believers in the medicinal power of cannabis. They’re here because they have a passion for it. I may write about strawberry-flavored joints, but I also get to write about the people who are creating legislation that will make the industry more inclusive and expunge the records of people like my dad. He died in 1999 and sometimes I wonder what he’d think if he could see me now. In his honor, I grow a couple of plants every year – flagrantly out in the open in the garden of our family homestead. Last fall I was late to a virtual meeting about an upcoming trade show because I’d been busy rescuing the crop, which had been hit hard by an early rain. I explained this to my boss, who was totally understanding. And I got a shot of sheer delight at how the world is changing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/nov/16/ultimately-uninhabitable-western-sydneys-legacy-of-planning-failure","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-15T16:30:08Z","webTitle":"‘Ultimately uninhabitable’: western Sydney’s legacy of planning failure ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/16/ultimately-uninhabitable-western-sydneys-legacy-of-planning-failure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/nov/16/ultimately-uninhabitable-western-sydneys-legacy-of-planning-failure","fields":{"headline":"‘Ultimately uninhabitable’: western Sydney’s legacy of planning failure ","bodyText":"On 4 January 2020, the western Sydney suburb of Penrith was one of the hottest places on Earth at 48.9C. The heat that day, at the foot of the Blue Mountains, gave a brief window into what the future will be like in the city’s outer rings, soon to be home to more than 1.5 million people. Climate change is no longer looming. It’s here. Since records began, Australia has warmed by about 1.44C and rising, but the heat isn’t felt equally: few places are suffering as severely as western Sydney. With plans to construct a new city around the Nancy Bird Walton airport at Badgerys Creek, and thousands of families moving into new release areas in the north-west and south-west, the time to insist on climate sensitive development is now, experts say. “Australians deserve a better future and if we don’t design for the changing climate, dwellings will ultimately be uninhabitable and we know that is worse in areas of disadvantage,” says Davina Rooney, chief executive of the Green Building Council. “We will be entrenching energy poverty, and the consequences are quite substantial.” But there are fears the impact of climate change has been compounded by slapdash urban planning and shortsighted design preferences, which have favoured big sprawling houses with dark roofs, black driveways and small yards over more energy-efficient properties. It was only in August that planning controls were implemented banning dark roofing in Sydney’s south-western growth area and specifying room for trees in back yards. Rob Stokes, the NSW planning minister, said the changes marked a new direction from decades of development on Sydney’s fringes. “When designing lots for detached housing, we need back yards which are big enough to plant a tree or have a garden,” Stokes said. “We need to say goodbye to the trend of having dark roofs that not only attract and retain heat and raise ambient street temperatures, but lead to astronomical electricity bills because of the need to cool homes.” Sebastian Pfautsch, associate professor of urban studies at the University of Western Sydney, says the region is an important marker for other capitals, since it has one of the fastest growing urban populations in Australia. “The mistakes [in urban design] being made in western Sydney are being made in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth. We’re not really thinking [about] how … we deal with the changing climate, particularly heat.” How did we get here? Successive governments in NSW have talked about “liveable suburbs” as they grapple with waves of migration, demand for housing and soaring property prices. The state’s population will swell by 3.3 million to more than 11 million by 2061, according to the latest intergenerational report, requiring 1.7m extra homes. More than half that growth will come from immigration. Many of these new arrivals are leaving behind crowded cities and have chosen Australia because of the lifestyle it offers. Those who come to Sydney will overwhelmingly settle in the western suburbs, and for many that will mean new houses in areas long designated for expansion. Many of the developments now being built were planned under Labor a decade ago under its Draft Metropolitan Strategy. Areas of the north-west around Rouse Hill, and the south-west around Oran Park and Leppington, were earmarked for development in the 2000s. Labor set out to address the planning failures of the 1990s, when areas of the north-west were opened up with no public transport, resulting in horrendous commutes and choked roads. Labor pledged it wouldn’t build any more suburbs before it had committed to rail infrastructure. Railways to Rouse Hill and Leppington have now been built, although their completion lagged well behind development of the suburbs. After leaving parliament, the former planning minister Frank Sartor recalled the pressures he felt from colleagues to allow developers to open up new areas, despite the stated policy of ensuring infrastructure was in place first. Sartor claimed he came under pressure from colleagues on behalf of the Urban Task Force, a group Sartor described as “nothing more than a lobby group for land speculators dressed up in the clothes of a respectable property group”. The group and its members were major donors to the ALP until the ban on political donations from developers was introduced in 2008. Developers hated some of the decisions that defined new release areas – such as the introduction of levies to help pay for infrastructure. The levies had long-term consequences too. Because they were imposed per hectare of land there was an incentive to squeeze in as many blocks as possible, whereas a charge per house or lot would have encouraged a mix of block sizes. Powerless councils In NSW, if a planned dwelling satisfies the broad criteria of the building codes it does not have to go to the local council for individual assessment, under the rules known as “exempt and complying development”. This means that councils have little say over the final look and feel of the suburb. “Zero setbacks” permitted as part of exempt and complying development mean that one wall of a house can be built right to the boundary of the lot, leading to cramped streetscapes where the eaves of neighbours almost touch each other. “The problem is that the houses are flat and wide,” Pfautsch says. “They’re from fence to fence. “The problem is with the state government. They say this new growth area will have 8,000 homes. If local government comes up with requests, the developer resists and just says: ‘We won’t do it’.” Councils also struggle to enforce building codes. NSW’s Basix rules, introduced in 2008 and designed to drive more sustainable housing, require water-saving native plants. Many councils also require a significant tree to be planted in the back yard of new houses. But stretched councils rarely have the resources to check that the plants – often the last step in the building process – have been planted, let alone whether they have survived their first couple of summers. The same goes for street trees – the developers put them in, but there is little attention given to whether they survive. What do homebuyers want? Developers stress that what they build is driven by demand – families want large single dwelling homes, not units. Pfautsch agrees: “People who buy off the plan don’t want gardens, they want a big house. “Two storeys are not favoured in the new estates, instead they choose sprawling houses … High rise would be much more sustainable. They could have open space around them and parks and community facilities.” Pfautsch says that people who buy into these estates have been drained of resources buying the land and then try to put up the biggest, least expensive house possible. That means they don’t always have the budget for double glazing or other features that might improve liveability and energy efficiency. Prof Bill Randolph, from the University of NSW’s City Futures research centre, says the size of plots is falling and housing is getting bigger. “It’s what the market wants,” he says. “I don’t know why [development control plans] don’t require more open space. The floor-space ratios are quite permissive, and most unsustainable. “Black roofs mean you need cooling systems and because they are built right to the boundary, often the air-conditioning systems are competing with each other and blowing hot air toward the neighbours.” In 2007, Oran Park, the site of a former racetrack, was given the green light for accelerated development into a suburb of more than 9,000 homes, with an eventual population of 45,000. The suburb has a masterplan and 38 hectares of open space has been reserved, but critics say little thought has been given to sustainability. Oran Park was permitted to have much smaller lots than previously allowed, because the government wanted to meet its housing targets. Land buyers then chose houses from display homes resulting in a mishmash of styles that filled the blocks. There are trees in the streets, but very few in the tiny yards. Oran Park is served only by infrequent buses, which take residents to train stations at Campbelltown, 14km away, or Leppington, 12km away. Understandably, many residents rely on cars. Ryan Azzopardi and Melissa Lauricella, a newly married couple, have been living in Oran Park for about a year. They bought the land four years ago and then built a project home which they saw at a display village. The couple are very happy with their choice, and like the suburb, but their house has familiar energy drawbacks, despite having solar power installed. The roof is dark, bricks are also a darker brown, with front pillars a lighter beige. Azzopardi says no one asked him about the colours of bricks and roof tiles. “It’s a funny situation. The sun goes over the house, and in the morning it’s hot on one side, and in the evening it’s warm round the back. And in winter, it is freezing out the back of the house. But when summer comes around, and we get the intense morning sun, the rooms around the front can get really hot. It doesn’t get too discomforting, but it is noticeable.” How can we do better? State planning ministers have tried various means to drive more sustainable development. Sartor introduced the Growth Centres Commission in 2005 to speed land releases and tame the forces of the market. The Coalition set up the Greater Sydney Commission in 2015 and appointed Lucy Turnbull, a former lord mayor of Sydney, as its initial chair. It was an effort to coordinate development across the metropolis, envisaging Sydney as three linked cities. Some of the age-old failings were top of mind: ensuring infrastructure kept pace with new housing developments, ensuring there was enough housing in the future and making sure jobs were near where people lived. It had a goal of creating “the 30-minute city,” an ideal maximum time for people to travel to work, childcare or shops. It talked about walkable neighbourhoods. And for the first time it talked about addressing urban heat. That meant more green space, greater tree canopy and more sustainable housing. When Gladys Berejiklian became the premier in 2017, two measures designed to make cities more liveable were among her 14 stated priorities. The first was increasing the proportion of homes within a 10-minute walk of “quality green open and public space” by 10%, or 230,000 homes, by 2023. As of January 2021, the government said it had met that goal for 100,000 homes. The second was achieving an increase in the tree canopy by planting 1m trees by 2023. By March it was claiming to be halfway there. But the target does not measure trees cleared or the loss of farmland as Sydney keeps expanding. Pushing the limits Badgerys Creek on Sydney’s south-west fringe is the next frontier of large-scale urban planning. The so-called aerotropolis (recently renamed Bradfield) beside the new Nancy Bird Walton airport will be home to an eventual population of 1.5 million people. Billed as “the beating heart of the Western parkland city”, Bradfield will be done differently, according to Planning NSW. The department has announced precinct plans for three large areas that will have different purposes: an employment zone, a city core and residential area, and an agribusiness zone that will largely focus on food processing. The planners promise “excellent access and connectivity, provided through public infrastructure” and “excellent liveability, where a ‘beyond business as usual’ approach will focus on creating a cooler and greener city”. “In this place, blue/green systems will be particularly important, forming the basis for a more sustainable, resilient plan, one that respects and connects with country,” the key documents say. A draft sustainability report from consultants Alluvium says it is possible to have “a greener more resilient Western Sydney area with up to 7C of cooling on extreme heat days provided by better design, greening and irrigation”. It says extreme and strong heat stress days can be reduced from 47 to 19 days each summer. The report says this will be achieved by larger natural areas of vegetation to provide cooling and biodiversity, water bodies to provide evaporative cooling through misting and irrigation breezes, and more vegetation, including green roofs, walls and facades providing shade, insulation and evapotranspiration. Green space needs to be placed upwind of significant areas and “high albedo” (lighter coloured) building materials should be used to reflect light and heat, while shade should be provided through eaves, overhangs, ventilation and street trees that need deep soil planting spaces and passive irrigation. It all sounds promising, but no one expects the good intentions to translate easily into reality. The wildlife assessment management report, also part of the publicly released planning documents, warns that the airport itself is a threat to achieving the vision because green initiatives will “increase the risk of bird strike”. “Safeguarding the 24/7 operations of the airport and the vision of the Western Sydney Aerotropolis are essentially at odds,” it states. And this is before the powerful forces of commercial development bear down on the planners. Outside observers remain cautious. Rooney, of the Green Building Council, says: “The Greater Sydney Commission has put out a very strong vision for a green Aerotropolis and … the planning concepts are very focused on bringing green living spaces. But obviously the devil is in the detail of planning implementation. It’s just too critical for this not to be delivered.” Events in the north-west offer a further reason for pessimism. At Jordan Springs, the developer Lend Lease promised “tree-lined streets, picturesque parks and a thriving mix of community-focused businesses”. In fact Jordan Springs has many of the same attributes as Oran Park – few trees, small lots and dark-roofed houses that stretch to the property boundaries. But it is the NSW government’s recent decision to reverse its requirement for an employment zone that has planners and local residents worried. In October 2020, at the height of the concerns about a Covid-induced downturn in the housing industry, Stokes announced that the 38 hectares reserved for a jobs hub would instead be turned into 500 more houses, and fast-tracked. Geoff Brown, a local resident and activist, told the ABC it was a terrible deal for local workers. “How is that a net benefit for NSW? A long-held promise [of] 38.4 hectares of employment land and thousands of ongoing local jobs, scrapped for 500 homes and just 252 temporary construction jobs.” Onus on government Perhaps the big picture answer is that more Australians should opt for denser living, allowing more space for parkland and community facilities. But even if we continue to build on the fringes while also building more apartments around railway stations and in the inner city, Prof Bill Randolph of City Futures says the challenge is the same: good planning lies in a much higher level of government intervention to ensure and prioritise sustainability. “The origin [of the problem] is the department of planning and their determination to get the numbers of dwellings [up], and the development industry. The prime criteria for both is the development numbers. It’s not sustainability or liveability.” Randolph says the hands-off approach by government is particularly obvious in urban redevelopment around railway stations and is responsible for the lack of urban green space. “In urban renewal areas developers have to buy expensive land. No one wants the park. The government doesn’t buy up the land then develop it, it leaves it to the private sector. The planning system acts as an enabler to the market rather than thinking about sustainability.” He believes the state government should take a much more hands-on role in shaping new urban areas, as occurs in other countries. Rooney agrees: “If we look at long-term sustainable projects like Barangaroo, which has been delivered as a net zero precinct, it had incredibly strong governance and government leadership through a really long trajectory,” she says. She says an important step is the update the national construction code, which can ensure buildings are fit for a changing climate. “It’s been a decade since we have updated the national building code. We need to have an ecosystem that lifts standards,” she says. The new code has been on exhibition for the last three months and will be in place by late 2022. It proposes upgrades to standards for glass, insulation, water heaters and other materials to drive thermal efficiency. “There will be a lot of discussion about the cost of making homes better but we have to really lean into the long-term value. “We need net zero homes. There is a commitment to a trajectory and now we need that to happen. There is a whole lot of green infrastructure – we know that with large green spaces, light-coloured roofs, tree cover, that we can change the temperature. Then we need to look at other elements like public transport, walkability, a sense of community.” She also suggests that the pandemic, far from being an excuse for backing off higher standards, should be a catalyst for change. “The community has become aware of the value of green space. Councils have put in pop-up cycleways and pop-up outdoor dining. I think there has been a community renaissance of their understanding of green spaces.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2019/dec/05/bp-boosts-stake-in-solar-firm-amid-clean-energy-plan-for-its-offices","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-05T18:12:38Z","webTitle":"BP boosts stake in solar firm amid clean energy plan for its offices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/05/bp-boosts-stake-in-solar-firm-amid-clean-energy-plan-for-its-offices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2019/dec/05/bp-boosts-stake-in-solar-firm-amid-clean-energy-plan-for-its-offices","fields":{"headline":"BP boosts stake in solar firm amid clean energy plan for its offices","bodyText":"BP has increased its stake in the British solar venture Lightsource BP as it prepares to strike a deal to power its offices with renewable energy from next year. The companies announced plans to set up a 50:50 joint venture almost two years after BP made its return to the solar market by snapping up a 43% stake in Lightsource for £200m. BP will increase its stake in the company by buying new shares for an undisclosed price to help accelerate Lightsource BP’s solar power targets. It had hoped to grow its portfolio to 6GW of capacity by 2023 but plans to reach 10GW over the same timescale. BP has used the UK solar startup to re-establish a presence in the solar sector after it backed out of the market in 2011. It plans to use more solar power in its own offices too. Dev Sanyal, the boss of BP’s alternative energy division, said the oil company was in conversation with the venture to source solar energy to power BP’s global offices next year. BP’s commodity traders will also sell more renewable energy from Lightsource BP projects to other companies that want to run on clean energy. Sanyal said: “BP is committed to helping meet the world’s rapidly growing demand for low-carbon energy. Solar, which is predicted to increase by a factor of 10 by 2040, plays a key role in this energy transition. That is why we want to invest more in Lightsource BP and to deepen our partnership.” Lightsource BP has grown its pipeline of solar projects almost 10-fold across nine new countries in the last two years by harnessing BP’s international networks and energy trading expertise. The company has also been experimenting with ways to boost the financial rewards of solar power projects, including trials that use double-sided panels or help to balance the energy system at night. Nick Boyle, the group chief executive of Lightsource BP, said: “Two years ago, we were in four countries and we’re now in 13. We had a global pipeline of 1.6GW and today it’s over 12GW. It’s that sort of additional momentum which has been facilitated [by BP].” BP’s fresh investment in the solar company came as environmental lawyers prepared to take action against a multimillion-pound BP advertising campaign. ClientEarth said the company was misleading the public with claims of being committed to a low-carbon future. The charity is calling for the ads to be banned unless they include a health warning that BP’s oil and gas spending is contributing to the climate crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/oct/14/queensland-transition-to-renewables-would-generate-almost-10000-jobs-analysis-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-14T03:51:04Z","webTitle":"Queensland transition to renewables would generate almost 10,000 jobs, analysis shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/14/queensland-transition-to-renewables-would-generate-almost-10000-jobs-analysis-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/oct/14/queensland-transition-to-renewables-would-generate-almost-10000-jobs-analysis-shows","fields":{"headline":"Queensland transition to renewables would generate almost 10,000 jobs, analysis shows","bodyText":"Queensland has the potential to draw all of its electricity from renewable sources in a 15-year transition away from fossil fuels that would generate almost 10,000 jobs, according to analysis commissioned by the Queensland Conservation Council. Almost 11,000 ongoing jobs would then operate and maintain a suite of energy sources either existing or proposed in the state, including wind and solar and farms, hydro plants and battery projects. The QCC analysis is timed to energise the state’s election campaign and point candidates and leaders to the huge potential in renewables in the sunshine state. Queensland’s environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, told an environment forum that a re-elected Palaszczuk government would develop a climate action plan to set out how the state would meet its targets on lowering greenhouse gas emissions up to 2030. The state government has targets to cut emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030 and have half of the state’s electricity generated from renewables by the same year. The government aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Guardian Australia has been told by sources familiar with the matter that work on an expected green paper that would have laid out the government’s plans to reach the 2050 target has stopped, and is likely to have been shelved. Tristan Edis, a renewable energy analyst who was commissioned by QCC to look at existing and planned renewable projects, said the state had “world-class” opportunities in renewables simply because of the amount of sunshine and land available. “What we see here is that maybe Queenslanders have not been told that they have plenty of potential to generate enough electricity for what they can consume, and then more,” he said. “We really have to start planning out the infrastructure that can support it.” The QCC climate and energy campaigner Claire Fryer said its plan showed coal power could be replaced with renewables and storage “to give us plenty of electricity, at the right times, in the right place, with stable 24/7 supply”. Edis examined all the existing, planned and proposed projects across the state, finding a transition to renewables for domestic electricity supply within 15 years would generate 9,400 jobs in construction and almost 11,000 to maintain. A key step would be increasing investment in electricity transmission infrastructure, he said. Solar, wind, bioenergy and solar thermal would take up the bulk of the supply, with energy storage provided through batteries, pumped hydro and hydrogen produced from wind or solar power. Included in the QCC proposal are 33 windfarms, 76 solar farms, 1.5m rooftop solar systems and 26 batteries. QCC does not support additional dams for pumped hydro power. Three regions were best positioned to take advantage of a renewables boom, QCC said – Townsville, the dry tropics and the far north; central Queensland and the Mackay-Whitsunday area; and the Darling Downs/Condamine region. Green paper shelved? The Queensland government first flagged the development of a green paper in 2017 as part of a climate transition strategy. A state Treasury report shows it was working with the Department of Environment and Science to develop the green paper, and then a white paper. The QCC director, Louise Matthiesson, said conservation groups had been consulted on the green paper in 2019. “After the [2019] general election, we were told the consultation process was on hold and that’s the last thing we heard,” she said. “It seems it was shelved after the federal election.” Guardian Australia asked Enoch’s office if the green paper had been dropped, but a response did not answer that question. A statement from the minister said: “A re-elected Palaszczuk Labor Government will deliver a Climate Action Plan 2020-2030 to map out our actions for the next decade.” The minister said the government had taken strong action on climate change, and pointed to its $500m investment in publicly owned renewables as part of the state’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. “We are already taking strong action on climate change,” the statement said. Speaking at a forum on Tuesday, Enoch joined the LNP environment spokesman, David Crisafulli, and the Greens MP, Michael Berkman. Crisafulli said an LNP government would align its emissions reduction targets with the federal government’s goals for the Paris climate agreement. The Morrison government has refused to back a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Matthiesson said it was important that Enoch had recommitted to developing a climate action plan, but repeating a promise made in 2017 did not go far enough. “Whichever party wins government, the next four years will be crucial in whether or not we can meet that interim 2030 target,” she said. “This is an incredibly urgent issue that affects the future of our kids, our economy and our lifestyles.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/aug/31/angela-merkels-16-years-battle-with-the-centrifugal-forces-of-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-31T04:00:05Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel’s 16-year battle with the centrifugal forces of politics ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/31/angela-merkels-16-years-battle-with-the-centrifugal-forces-of-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/aug/31/angela-merkels-16-years-battle-with-the-centrifugal-forces-of-politics","fields":{"headline":"Angela Merkel’s 16-year battle with the centrifugal forces of politics ","bodyText":"As Maren Heinzerling crossed hands with the most powerful woman in the world, leaned backwards and started to spin her dance partner in a circle, she began to worry. “What are you doing,” the retired railway engineer recalled thinking. “You are spinning around the room with Angela Merkel.” Heinzerling had to grip the chancellor’s hands tighter as they span faster with each rotation. “I realised I couldn’t let go, or the chancellor would have careered across the hall and smashed into a wall.” The scene dates back to 17 May 2017, when Heinzerling, then 78, was invited to Merkel’s chancellory in Berlin to pick up a national award for her volunteering work, teaching physics to primary-school-age refugee children. Heinzerling had improvised their little dance number after Merkel, who has a PhD in quantum chemistry, had been too quick on an experiment the science teacher had devised for the cameras to do their work. “But then I remembered this other experiment,” Heinzerling said, and she spontaneously grabbed the chancellor’s hands. The point of the dance was to demonstrate centrifugal force, which in Newtonian mechanics is the invisible force that appears to act on a body moving in a circular path. Merkel’s lack of a poker face has become immortalised in comedy sketches, her eye-rolls and frowns at press conferences and obligatory public functions are memes on social media. But in pictures of the her dance with Heinzerling, she is smiling. “My impression was that Frau Merkel cared for nothing else in the world at that moment,” Heinzerling told the Guardian in March, three weeks before she died unexpectedly. Perhaps the German chancellor was smiling because she knew that the photographers had a chance to snap a perfect metaphor for her idea of leadership. The scientific concept of centrifugal forces has been repeatedly cited by Merkel and her spokespeople to describe political challenges. Over the course of 16 years, she has dedicated most of her political energy towards nullifying crises that could have spiralled out of control. When Merkel clears her desk at the chancellory, she will have matched the record previously held by her mentor, the “eternal chancellor” Helmut Kohl. Unlike all her seven male predecessors, she will be stepping down of her own will, at the end of a full term, and while her popularity ratings remain so phenomenally high that her three most likely successors have all in different ways modelled themselves on her. Merkel managed to retain her power by moving her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) into the centre of the political spectrum, entering coalitions with both the centre-right Free Democratic party (FDP) and the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD). Merkel’s CDU became the sun that other parties could merely orbit. A coalition with the Green party long looked like the logical conclusion of her realignment: in 2018, it only failed because of the reluctance of the FDP. Critics say the cost of Merkel’s success has been an erosion of the political landscape: by co-opting other parties’ policies and programmes, she has made Germany’s traditional parties increasingly indistinguishable. The CDU has struggled to put up a united front as it approaches the post-Merkel era: party insiders fear a defeat at the September vote could throw the once-dominant force of German postwar politics into an existential crisis that could culminate in a split between centrists and conservative hardliners. Europe Having spent the first 35 years of her life on the eastern side of the iron curtain, Merkel already had first-hand experience of how quickly political systems can unravel once forces of flight are unleashed. After winning her first election in 2005, Germany’s first female chancellor brought to her office a heightened awareness that even small decisions in the most populous and economically powerful country at the heart of the European Union could have direct consequences for the continent as a whole. “Merkel has two core qualities,” said Stefan Kornelius, the foreign editor of Süddeutsche Zeitung and author of her authorised biography. “She is risk-averse and a centrist in the sense that she wants to bring people together rather than alienate them. These qualities apply to domestic politics as well as the European Union, which is a political constellation that has an intrinsic tendency to drift apart.” Months into Merkel’s second term in office, the EU risked being wrenched apart by events on the stock markets. A global recession sparked by a burst housing bubble in the US triggered a balance-of-payment crisis in the eurozone, which member states were unable to counteract through devaluation because they were tied into the same currency. As the crisis intensified, politicians in northern Europe called on countries like Greece or Italy to be kicked out of the club, which would have amounted to a de-facto break-up of the eurozone. Against domestic resistance, Merkel took the necessary steps to keep the arms of the eurozone member states tightly locked together, negotiating bailouts for hardest-hit states and giving political support for massive liquidity injections on behalf of the European Central Bank. As France’s influence wavered under presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, and Britain began to peel off from the bloc of nations, Merkel rose to become Europe’s single most powerful broker of compromises. She retained that role in the years leading up to and after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, patiently enduring the special pleading of British prime ministers in the hope of keeping the UK within the EU’s orbit while keeping a united front with the other 26 member states. “We must do everything to prevent centrifugal forces,” she said in a speech shortly after the Brexit vote. “Merkel’s greatest legacy is that she managed to keep the EU together in an era of intense strain, something that requires political will power and usually some German money,” Kornelius said. Perhaps the greatest irony of her leadership is that it took a woman from the east to assuage fears, shared more or less openly by most European states at the time, around a post-reunification resurgence of German aggression. In spite of her erstwhile criticism of the Schröder government’s pacifist stance on Iraq, Germany under her leadership engaged in no new wars other than pro-forma participation in European military missions against Islamic State and in Mali. In 2011, the same year that Merkel’s second government ended military conscription, it refrained from joining the Nato mission in Libya. “She steered Germany into the centre of Europe and increased its influence without being perceived as a threat by its neighbours,” said Kornelius. “That’s a historic achievement.” Russia and China Yet while Germany may no longer perceived as a threat, another kind of suspicion has grown: that Merkel has turned her country into a kind of oversized Switzerland, a state that favours chequebook diplomacy over military conflict but remains politically neutral less out of principle than to protect its trade links. Merkel provoked Chinese ire when she met the Dalai Lama at the start of her leadership, but intensified commercial ties to the People’s Republic thereafter, with nigh-annual visits to Beijing and exports tripling over the course of a decade and a half. She aided Russian dissidents like Alexei Navalny, but has also relentlessly pursued a Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that many fear will increase Russia’s geopolitical influence. The distrust such decisions has sown in Ukraine, other eastern European states and the Baltics is often ignored in Berlin’s political circles. While Merkel always took the right steps in moments of crisis to guarantee that Europe would not spin out of control, she has done little to stabilise the continent’s joint political structures by deepening them. “The image of centrifugal forces is key to Merkel’s stance on Europe, but the same image also reveals her greatest flaw,” said Josef Janning, senior associate fellow of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “She never understood that centrifugal forces can only be contained in the long run by strengthening the centripetal force, to pull bodies of mass more strongly to the centre.” Partly as a result of German vetoes, Europe’s fiscal and banking union remains incomplete. A common European asylum system remains out of reach. A sovereign European security strategy, allowing the union of states to act more independently of the United States, is still an idea rather than a reality. “Germany under Merkel hasn’t amplified Europe’s ambition,” said Janning. “It has given up articulating an idea where Europe should eventually end up. It has simply made itself comfortable in an imperfect set-up”. Refugees At its best, Merkel’s almost scientific approach to decision-making meant she understood political challenges as complex problems that cannot be solved with soundbites. At no point in her 16 years as chancellor was this more apparent than in the summer of 2015, when more than one million migrants and refugees, most of whom had been uprooted by the war in Syria, crossed into Europe. Merkel’s decision not to close Germany’s borders to those arriving via Hungary and shelter around 890,000 refugees over the course of that year is well known. Less well known are the alternative scenarios sketched out by her advisers. Closed doors on the German border would have meant a build-up of refugees on the Balkan route, causing chaos in a region still recovering from a decade of civil wars. It could have left Greece, the focal point of the first crisis of the Merkel era, to cope with millions of refugees on its own. And it would have risked destroying the Schengen system, the foundational principle of open borders within Europe. Taking in Syria’s refugees, not stopping them, looked like the anti-centrifugal option. “One of Merkel’s greatest strengths has always been that she thought about political problems rationally, and in the long term, when most of her male antagonists thought about them emotionally, in the short term,” said Gerald Knaus, the chairman of the European Stability Initiative, a thinktank that advises EU member-states on migration policy. “She has a scientist’s scepticism: can this solution actually be made to work? “In 2015, for example, she knew that closing the German border to refugees wasn’t actually an option while her government was committed to not use violence to deter individuals. In recent years some governments, like Croatia on its border with Bosnia, were prepared to treat refugees cruelly. But Germany in 2015 made an ethical decision not to.” The events of summer 2015 did unleash new forces, which threatened to overstretch the capacities of the German state – the staff of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees increased five-fold that year – and eventually to loosen Merkel’s own hold on political power. Anti-immigration party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which had originally been founded in opposition to Merkel’s bailouts during the eurozone crisis, become an openly rightwing populist outfit and found a new stride, entering parliament for the first time as the third largest party in 2017. Rightwing extremist circles were further radicalised, increasingly targeting asylum shelters with arson attacks in the coming years and assassinating a CDU Merkel ally with pro-immigration views in 2019. No other country in Europe saw as much severe and fatal rightwing violence that same year as Germany. Yet once again Merkel understood how to slow down the dance: she resisted calls to step down, and sat out the conflict with her inner-party rivals. A “money for refugees” deal with Turkey, and similar arrangements with Libya and Morocco, meant the number of migrants and refugees arriving in Germany dropped off dramatically. The AfD has carved out a steady presence in the former regions of Germany’s east, but has struggled to formulate coherent policies beyond its anti-immigration stance and looks set to underperform on its 2017 showing this September. “In the end, Merkel survived the refugee crisis because she resisted the pressure to make promises she couldn’t keep,” said Knaus, who is credited with devising the refugee deal between Turkey and the EU. “Others made that mistake and became unbelievable as a result.” Climate crisis The German chancellor’s heightened awareness of the centrifugal forces inherent in dynamic situations has also given her a tendency to slow down processes of a more progressive nature. Merkel, Germany’s environment minister in Kohl’s fifth cabinet in the 90s, has throughout her tenure spoken of the climate crisis as a “global challenge”. But her own record on the subject is mixed. The decision to phase out nuclear power in Germany was one that Merkel inherited from the preceding Social Democrat-Green coalition government, but one which she had started to put into reverse gear in her second term before U-turning again after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011. Germany is now on course to close its last six remaining nuclear plants by the end of 2022. Critics say the nuclear exit has increased Germany’s reliance on dirty carbon-based coal and gas, though supporters of the policy argue the exit plan drove a boom for renewable energy sources that would not have happened otherwise. “The optimists were right,” said Uwe Leprich, a climate policy specialist at the Saarland University of Applied Sciences. Balancing nuclear and renewable sources on the same energy grid, he argued, would have been an enormous technical challenge that would have slowed down green innovation. Instead, Germany looked for a few years like it wanted to become the world’s green champion. At the height of a boom in solar power, German companies producing photo-voltaic modules hogged 20% of the global market. In the years after Fukushima, the number of new wind farms built every year gained pace dramatically: the amount of electricity gained from wind blowing across German land and sea doubled to 106 TWH within six years. But as Germany’s Energiewende (“energy turn”) picked up speed, Merkel’s government tried to reduce its momentum. Renewable energy, her cabinet argued, needed to outgrow the subsidy regime of old and learn to finance itself through the market alone. Since 2017, wind farms are no longer paid set feed-in premiums but have to compete for subsidies in an auction system. The number of new wind farms has dropped off dramatically since then. Since the start of the year 2018, Germany has built 1,728 new turbines – fewer than in the year 2017 alone. The slowdown could now threaten Germany’s target to cover 65% of its electricity needs through renewable energy by 2030. A reluctance to support new technologies as aggressively as its competitors has already put an end to the solar boom: there are no German companies among the world’s top 10 manufacturers of solar panels. Seven of them are Chinese. “Germany got scared of its own courage,” said Leprich. “We fell back to the energy blueprints of the noughties, and ignored new technologies that could have have offered alternative means to store energy. “Under Merkel, Germany gambled away its former status as a renewable energy leader and has long been overtaken by nations like Denmark or the Netherlands.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/jun/09/great-britain-coal-free-industrial-revolution-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-09T16:47:19Z","webTitle":"Great Britain heads for record coal-free period during lockdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/09/great-britain-coal-free-industrial-revolution-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/jun/09/great-britain-coal-free-industrial-revolution-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Great Britain heads for record coal-free period during lockdown","bodyText":"Great Britain will on Wednesday be able to celebrate not having generated any coal-powered electricity for two months – the longest period since the 1880s. Great Britain, which introduced coal-powered electricity to the world in the 1880s, has run its electricity network without burning coal since midnight on 9 April, according to National Grid. A collapse in energy demand because of the coronavirus lockdown and the sunniest May on record has enabled the country to increase its reliance on solar power and other renewable energy sources such as wind. “The exact two-month mark is midnight tonight (00:00 on Wednesday 10 June), which will mark 61 days (or 1,464 hours) since the last coal generator came off the system,” a spokesman for National Grid’s Electricity System Operator said. The coal-free period beats the previous record of 18 days, six hours and 10 minutes set in June 2019. The figures apply to Great Britain – England, Wales and Scotland – only, as Northern Ireland is not part of National Grid. Low power prices caused by reduced industrial demand, because of the lockdown and levies on carbon emissions, has made it increasingly unprofitable to run coal-fired power stations. Great Britain hopes to close all coal plants by 2024 as part of efforts to reach the government’s net zero emissions goal by 2050. Coal plants emit almost double the amount of carbon dioxide – a key cause of global heating – as gas-fired power plants. A decade ago, about 40% of the country’s electricity came from coal. Use of renewable power, such as wind and solar, has soared during the lockdown as it often has lower running costs than gas and coal plants and there have been favourable weather conditions. May was the greenest-ever month for electricity production, with the lowest average carbon intensity on record at 143 grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour, National Grid said. Carbon intensity is a measure of how much carbon dioxide is emitted for each kilowatt hour of electricity produced. Renewable energy use has also overtaken coal in the US for the first time in more than 130 years. The US government said renewables overtook coal as the primary energy source in 2019. Coal had been the main energy source for the US every year since it surpassed wood in 1885. • This article was amended on 10 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to Great Britain “not having used any coal-powered electricity for two months”. That should have said not having generated any coal-powered electricity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/sep/01/music-mogul-akon-going-ahead-with-futuristic-akon-city-in-senegal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-01T15:43:36Z","webTitle":"Music mogul Akon going ahead with futuristic 'Akon City' in Senegal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/01/music-mogul-akon-going-ahead-with-futuristic-akon-city-in-senegal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/sep/01/music-mogul-akon-going-ahead-with-futuristic-akon-city-in-senegal","fields":{"headline":"Music mogul Akon going ahead with futuristic 'Akon City' in Senegal","bodyText":"The US-Senegalese music mogul Akon has said he is pressing ahead with lofty plans to create a futuristic Pan-African smart city in Senegal next year, built in the mould of Wakanda - the fictional, technologically advanced African nation depicted in the Marvel blockbuster Black Panther. The 800-hectare (2,000 acre), surrealist, solar-powered “Akon City”, backed by the Senegalese government and funded by unnamed investors, was first announced by Akon in 2018. On Monday, Akon, whose real name is Aliaune Thiam, announced alongside Senegal’s minister for tourism, Alioune Sarr, that he had laid the first stone for the city in Mbodiène, a coastal village 62 miles from the capital, Dakar. The plans depict gleaming skyscrapers, shopping malls, music studios and eco-friendly tourist resorts. They envisage that “Akoin”, a cryptocurrency founded by the R&amp;B star, would be the central currency. Akon City is not the first major development announced by the singer for Africa. Previous plans and grand promises have attracted criticism on the continent and questions around transparency. Sarr hailed Akon’s launch for coming at a time when private investment in the west African country is scarce and badly needed, following the economic pain wrought by the coronavirus outbreak. Akon said the city would provide opportunities for Senegalese people and an alternative home for African Americans facing racial discrimination. “The system back home [in the US] treats them unfairly in so many different ways that you can never imagine,” he said. “And they only go through it because they feel that there is no other way. If you’re coming from America or Europe or elsewhere in the diaspora and you feel that you want to visit Africa, we want Senegal to be your first stop.” Few details of the project have been made public. Investors for the estimated $6bn scheme could not be named after signing non-disclosure agreements, but a third of the funding has been secured, Akon said. The singer has in the past dodged questions about how his cryptocurrency will be viable in the planned city, saying he would leave it to “the geeks” to work out. According to the US-based consulting and engineering firm KE International, it has been contracted to create the city, which “will define a new paradigm in design and architecture for Africa”. Plans are being considered to franchise the project to other countries in Africa, replicating smart-cities, such as the Mwale Medical and Technological City scheme in Kenya. The singer, born in the US to Senegalese parents and who grew up in Senegal, has been evangelical on the potential of African countries to redevelop and reduce dependency on western countries. In 2014, he announced “Light up Africa”, a charity initiative in partnership with the World Bank and governments to subsidise solar power and provide electricity to 600 million people in rural communities, more than half of the continent’s then population. The project claims to have helped more than 32 million people in 25 countries to gain access to basic electricity through solar energy. Questions around Akon’s operations in Africa grew when in 2015 he claimed to have manipulated African leaders. “In Africa, you’ve gotta manipulate them. You have to,” he told an Africa Day celebration at Coca-Cola, describing challenges in persuading African leaders to part-fund the projects. In 2018, he said his Akoin currency, which relies on smartphone use, would become a “stable currency alternative throughout Africa”. Yet it has faced questions around its access in low income countries where data is expensive. Only a third of people in Senegal use a smartphone, according to the Pew Research Centre. Michael Kimani, the chairman of the Blockchain Association of Kenya, dismissed the Akoin plans as “pie-in-the-sky” since it would need widespread usage across Africa to work. Work on the city is scheduled to start early next year, with completion of the first phase set for 2023. The plans say the town will initially cover 55 hectares (135 acres) but grow to 500 hectares by the end of the decade, with plans for artificial islands and a marina that can accommodate cruise ships. Sarr said he hoped the project would give the lie to “Cassandras … who always view new projects as pipe dreams” and vowed to help make sure it was completed on schedule."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/aug/29/is-deep-sea-mining-a-cure-for-the-climate-crisis-or-a-curse","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-29T09:00:02Z","webTitle":"Is deep-sea mining a cure for the climate crisis or a curse?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/29/is-deep-sea-mining-a-cure-for-the-climate-crisis-or-a-curse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/aug/29/is-deep-sea-mining-a-cure-for-the-climate-crisis-or-a-curse","fields":{"headline":"Is deep-sea mining a cure for the climate crisis or a curse?","bodyText":"In a display cabinet in the recently opened Our Broken Planet exhibition in London’s Natural History Museum, curators have placed a small nugget of dark material covered with faint indentations. The blackened lump could easily be mistaken for coal. Its true nature is much more intriguing, however. The nugget is a polymetallic nodule and oceanographers have discovered trillions of them litter Earth’s ocean floors. Each is rich in manganese, nickel, cobalt and copper, some of the most important ingredients for making the electric cars, wind turbines and solar panels that we need to replace the carbon-emitting lorries, power plants and factories now wrecking our climate. These metallic morsels could therefore help humanity save itself from the ravages of global warming, argue mining companies who say their extraction should be rated an international priority. By dredging up nodules from the deep we can slow the scorching of our planet’s ravaged surface. “We desperately need substantial amounts of manganese, nickel, cobalt and copper to build electric cars and power plants,” says Hans Smit, chief executive of Florida’s Oceans Minerals, which has announced plans to mine for nodules. “We cannot increase land supplies of these metals without having a significant environmental impact. The only alternative lies in the ocean.” Other researchers disagree – vehemently. They say mining deep-sea nodules would be catastrophic for our already stressed, plastic-ridden, overheated oceans. Delicate, long-living denizens of the deep – polychaete worms, sea cucumbers, corals and squid – would be obliterated by dredging. At the same time, plumes of sediments, laced with toxic metals, would be sent spiralling upwards to poison marine food-chains. “It is hard to imagine how seabed mines could feasibly operate without devastating species and ecosystems,” says UK marine biologist Helen Scales – a view shared by David Attenborough, who has called for a moratorium on all deep-sea mining plans. “Mining means destruction and in this case it means the destruction of an ecosystem about which we know pathetically little,” he says. It is a highly polarised dispute. On one side, proponents of nodule extraction claim it could save the world, while opponents warn it could unleash fresh ecological mayhem. For better or worse, these mineral spheres are going to play a critical role in determining our future – either by extricating us from our current ecological woes or by triggering even more calamitous outcomes. Polymetallic nodules were first discovered during the 1872-6 expedition of HMS Challenger, whose round-the-world voyage laid the foundations of modern oceanography. Hauled from seabeds more than 4,000 metres deep, they were initially thought to be formed from volcanic rocks and salts. Later it was shown they grow by absorbing metal compounds in seawater. “Typically, a nodule takes shape around an object – like a clam shell – that has fallen onto the seabed,” says marine biologist Adrian Glover of the Natural History Museum, London. “The one we have just put on display formed around the tooth of a megalodon, a species of giant shark that became extinct more than 3m years ago. That shows how long a nodule takes to grow on the seabed – about a centimetre every million years.” Despite this aeons-long accretion rate, trillions of nodules now cover the ocean bed. Some regions are so densely packed with them they look like cobbled streets. The Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) – which stretches from Mexico to Hawaii and covers more than 4 million square kilometres of seabed – is particularly rich in nodules, with estimates suggesting there is six times more cobalt and three times more nickel there than in the world’s entire land-based reserves. These riches have sparked the interest of mining and dredging companies, which are now lining up to get approval to explore the Clarion-Clipperton. To date, more than 20 exploration contracts have been awarded by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), the UN body responsible for controlling mining on international waters. Ultimately these companies hope to transform their exploration contracts into permits to extract the abyss’s mineral treasures and bring them to the surface. It will not be an easy task. On the dark ocean floor, pressure is 500 times greater than at the surface – the equivalent of lying underneath a stack of several dozen jumbo jets. To get around these hurdles, huge surface ships will be needed – to lower pipelines attached to robot bulldozers, which would then trundle over the deep sea floor sucking up nodules, before pumping them back to the surface five kilometres overhead. It sounds ambitious. Yet mining companies are upbeat. “We have built robot craft that run over the seabed to search for diamonds off the coast of Namibia and to build deep-sea pipeline trenches,” said Laurens de Jonge, manager of marine mining at Royal IHC, the Dutch supplier of maritime technology for dredging, offshore energy and mining. “The abyss means working at greater depths and pressures which will certainly involve new challenges, including our main focus: to limit the environmental impact as much as possible. However, we do not expect major differences occurring between past operations and future nodule mining. I would anticipate that once a company has decided to commit to a seabed mining operation and has been given an extraction licence, it could probably get under way in around three years.” As part of its plans, Royal IHC has designed a 16-metre-wide robot and built a three-metre test vehicle – called Apollo II – which would be able to gather about 400 tonnes of nodules in an hour and pump them aloft. Over two weeks’ operation, more than 100,000 tonnes could be removed this way. And after operating for 25 to 30 years – the anticipated limit for an ISA extraction licence – about 10,000 square kilometres of the seabed could be strip-mined. Extraction on this scale makes many marine biologists blanch – for its likely effect on deep-sea life could be profound and widespread, a point stressed by marine biologist Callum Roberts, of York University. “Nodules provide the only hard substrates in the thousands of square kilometres of the fine sedimentary ooze that covers the abyssal plain,” he says. “They are critical attachment points for a variety of creatures that cannot live directly in mud.” These residents include anemones, sponges, corals, nematode worms, and microscopic creatures called tardigrades – as well as octopuses, which have recently been found to lay eggs in sponges attached to nodules. “The biomass of the animals in the sediment is very low,” says ocean biologist Cindy van Dover, of Duke University. “However, the diversity is very high.” In fact, vast numbers of species still remain to be discovered in the abyss, say scientists, and many would be obliterated by deep-sea mining before they have been identified. “As the mining machines thunder across the seabed, they would kick up fine, muddy clouds that would hang in the water, because no strong currents are there to disperse them,” says Scales in her recent book, The Brilliant Abyss. “Delicate animals caught in these clouds and unable to swim away, like corals and sponges, would be smothered and choked.” Nor would there be any chance of a quick recovery from the onslaught. At these depths, where food and energy are limited, life proceeds at an extraordinarily slow rate. Populations could take centuries to recover. These dangers were summed up in a recent report by the international conservation charity Fauna and Flora International. “Deep seabed mining will result in large-scale habitat removal,” it states. “It will also produce sediment plumes which will disrupt ecological function and behavioural ecology of deep-ocean species, smothering fundamental ecological processes over vast areas.” For their part, mining companies stress they do not plan to start nodule dredging until full environmental assessments of their proposals are completed. These are now being worked on by ecologists, marine biologists and oceanographers. In addition, companies such as Ocean Minerals point to the damage done by mines on land, which create sinkholes, trigger biodiversity loss, and cause widespread contamination of soil and surface water. “In our considered opinion, the impact of nodule mining will be magnitudes less than the equivalent impact of the mining on land for the volumes of metals we will need in future,” says Smit. Pressure to obtain these metals in sufficient volumes is certainly going to become intense, analysts agree. One estimate, by the World Bank, suggests there will have to be a 500% growth in cobalt production by 2050 if demands for electric vehicle batteries and turbine manufacture are to be met. Nevertheless, deep-mining opponents say such forecasts still do not justify ploughing up the abyssal plain and point to two other approaches – metal recycling and alternative green technologies – that could reduce the need to mine for cobalt, manganese, nickel and copper. In the first case, these elements could be extracted from old electric-car batteries and used to make new ones. This recycling would limit the need to mine for fresh supplies of metal ores. And the concept is a useful one, acknowledges Professor Richard Herrington, head of earth sciences at the Natural History Museum, London. “Recycling is going to be important but it will not be enough on its own. By 2035, we might have about 35 to 40% of these metals from recycling – if we can get our act together now. “Where we get the other 60 to 65% is a different issue and a museum like ours has a real role to pay here – to get people to think about where we should extract the metals we need to save the world. These issues are going to shape our lives in the next few decades, after all.” Not everyone agrees with the claim that cobalt, manganese, nickel and copper are necessarily vitally important, however. “There are a whole range of viable alternative battery technologies that could avoid using these metals,” says Matthew Gianni, of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, a Dutch-based alliance of international green groups. For example, lithium iron phosphate batteries are now looking very promising.” The current rush to extract nodules is therefore misplaced, say green groups who argue that engineers and entrepreneurs should be given a time to develop new battery and power plant technologies – like lithium iron phosphate batteries. Hence their calls for a deep-sea mining moratorium. The problem is that the timetable for reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases is now so tight. The world cannot wait for much longer for new battery technologies to emerge. It needs to eliminate fossil-fuel burning urgently. Mining companies also deny they are rushing ahead with their plans. “We are still gathering in the science and I would say commercial operations are unlikely to start until the end of the decade,” says Chris Williams, managing director of UK Seabed Resources, which has its own plans to extract nodules from the Clipperton-Clarion Zone. “I am confident we will be able to show that extracting polymetallic nodules will have a lower impact on the environment than will be the case with the opening of new mines on land or the expansion of existing ones.” However, the notion that nodule-mining negotiations are going to proceed smoothly with agreement about strict extraction rules eventually being reached by the International Seabed Authority was thrown into disarray several weeks ago. The Pacific Island state of Nauru – one of ISA’s 167 member states – activated an obscure sub-clause in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea that allows countries to pull a two-year trigger if they feel negotiations are going too slow. The ISA now has two years to agree regulations governing deep-sea mining – if they don’t, mining contractors will be allowed to begin work regardless. Nauru is partnered with a mining company called DeepGreen and says it fears being overwhelmed by rising ocean levels and wants to speed up the exploitation of abyssal nodules as a way of promoting green technologies that might save it from inundation. Its activation of the ISA’s two-year clause has caused some consternation in the industry – and among deep-sea mining opponents who fear attempts are being made to stampede the world into deep-sea mining before its consequences can be properly assessed. For its part, ISA has played down the implications of Nauru’s move. Others are less sanguine. “This could really open the floodgates,” says Gianni. Such prospects only strengthen the urgency of assessing the likely effects of deep-sea mining, say scientists. It is a point stressed by Andrew Sweetman, professor of deep-sea ecology at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, who has been involved in carrying out deep-sea mining impact assessments for governments and mining companies. “We are living in a world where more and more people want to have the latest cellphones as well as electric vehicles and wind and solar power plants that will help in achieving net zero emissions. And these require metals like cobalt and manganese. “On its own, recycling these metals is unlikely to provide the ingredients we need for these devices, so mining is going to be important. On land it is associated with all sorts of problems and eventually there will be a push for deep-sea mining – and in the end it will happen. That means we need to get as much information about its impact so we are best placed to limit the damage.” Precious metals The world’s appetite for copper, manganese, cobalt, nickel and other elements needed for green technology is rocketing. Copper Global use jumped from 17.8m tonnes in 2009 to 24.5 million in 2019, driven by demands from manufacturers of renewable energy plants and electric vehicles. Copper’s high electrical conductivity, durability and malleability make it invaluable. Manganese Manganese compounds have been used by humans for millennia, with traces found in pigments used in cave paintings and Roman glassmaking. Today it is used in the form of electrolytic manganese dioxide, a key ingredient of lithium-ion and alkaline batteries. Nickel This vital ingredient of guitar strings is resistant to corrosion and oxidation, and easily forms alloys with other metals. More recently, it has become a main component for electric vehicle batteries. Cobalt This is the most controversial metal that is powering green technology. Used to make batteries, and solar and wind power plants, more than half the world’s supply is found in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where small independent mines have used children as young as seven to dig cobalt ores. Mineral sources Three key sources are being explored in the deepest parts of Earth’s oceans. Hydrothermal vents These are underwater volcanoes that spew sulphur compounds that include sulphides of silver, gold, manganese, cobalt, and zinc. Sea mounts Many of these underwater peaks are known to be rich in cobalt chemicals and have sparked the interest of mining companies. Polymetallic nodules These litter the bottom of the deep ocean. Mining companies have shown most interest in this source because of the relative ease of extraction. Most plans have earmarked the Clarion-Clipperton Zone as the target for mining, although some have pinpointed other areas. Florida’s Ocean Minerals wants to mine off the Cook Islands in the Pacific, for example."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2022/dec/18/australia-vs-south-africa-cricket-live-updates-score-first-test-day-two-latest-scores-aus-v-sa","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-18T07:21:22Z","webTitle":"Australia beat South Africa by six wickets – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/dec/18/australia-vs-south-africa-cricket-live-updates-score-first-test-day-two-latest-scores-aus-v-sa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2022/dec/18/australia-vs-south-africa-cricket-live-updates-score-first-test-day-two-latest-scores-aus-v-sa","fields":{"headline":"Australia beat South Africa by six wickets – as it happened","bodyText":"144.3 overs, 34 wickets, and six sessions of play, featuring two prodigiously talented bowling attacks, and one poorly prepared pitch. That was an odd Test match. The inquest into why the Gabba was so difficult to bat on will dominate the three cricket-free days. Thereafter the spotlight will fall on David Warner, whose Test career appears to be rapidly approaching its end. A few thousand miles away the focus will be on South Africa’s top order – weak on paper, disastrous on Queensland soil. West Indies were dismal a few weeks ago. South Africa don’t look like making over 200 in their remaining four knocks. This summer of cricket is fast becoming a headache for the game’s administrators. In amongst the doom and gloom credit is due to Travis Head for his match-winning 92 in the first innings. And all the bowlers took advantage of the conditions without getting carried away. Australia’s attack spread the wickets evenly among themselves and selectors now have the difficult decision around whether to recall Josh Hazlewood for the Boxing Day Test. They couldn’t drop Scott Boland on his home track, could they? I shall leave you with Geoff Lemon’s thoughts from the press box, but stay tuned for plenty more reaction over the coming days. I’ll see you back here in a week or so, full of Christmas pud. Of course, what all of this analysis of the surface reinforces is how incredible Travis Head’s first innings 92 was. In a match dominated by the ball, with some gaudy bowling figures, it has to be a batter who averaged just 46 across the two innings - and was caught down the legside twice on the same day – who wins the player of the match award. Steve Smith says it was probably the toughest pitch he’s ever played on in Australia. Nathan Lyon is asked if he can believe what’s happened in the past 48 hours. “Yeah, I can,” he replies, “because you’ve got the two best bowling attacks going at each other. There is going to be wickets falling and a great contest. The wicket was too much but it shows the quality of bowlers that’s running around out here. Pretty special.” Mitchell Starc, who celebrated his 300th Test wicket in this match, has a few words on the TV. Not sure we’ve had a two-day Test before. None of us can recall a two-day Test. Very interesting, let’s leave it at that. The last 18 months, two years, has been a lot more consistent and probably some of the best Test cricket I’ve played. Hopefully that can continue. I’m just enjoying it. It is a great group to be part of. Maybe not always in two days but when you win Test matches, it is great to enjoy successes. “This sort of offal was never served up before they started putting numbers on their backs,” chirrups Patrick O’Brien, who has presumably never heard of the England cricket team. 19 wickets fell today, on a surface that will be the subject of intense debate over the coming days. 8th over: Australia 35-4 (Labuschagne 5, Green 0) Australia reach 29 when Nortje sends down five-wides, increasing the extras tally to 14. South Africa have been full of purpose and intensity with the new ball and they have rattled their hosts. Labuschagne does well to withstand the heat, calling his partner through for a sharp single in the process. With Green on strike Nortje goes short again, and once more the ball flies way too high and fast over everyone for five wides that brings this remarkable Test to a close on day two. 7th over: Australia 24-4 (Labuschagne 4, Green 0) SA are not still in with a chance to win this match, but this showing will keep them in the series. A brisk 34-0 from Warner and Khawaja would have been extremely deflating, they can at least now remind themselves of the quality of their pace attack ahead of Melbourne. For the second time today Head gloves down the legside. Rabada has four. Australia are ballsing this up royally. Short and wide from Rabada, and Smith cracks a brutal square cut for four. Shorter and wider from Rabada and Smith can only find a top edge that flies through to Verreynne! Australia three down and building South Africa’s confidence with every dismissal. 6th over: Australia 15-2 (Labuschagne 4, Smith 2) Shot of the innings so far from Labuschagne, presenting a straight bat to return a half-volley from Nortje back where it came from. The pacer responds well, finding the outer portions of Labuschagne’s blade in quick succession, the first landing just short of mid-on, the second not troubling point. Then the batter has to be on his guard to drop a shorter delivery at his toes with short-leg genuflecting in anticipation. 5th over: Australia 11-2 (Labuschagne 0, Smith 2) So in the hierarchy of fallout from this match we can now presume we’re dealing with: a) the pitch b) David Warner’s future c) South Africa’s quality. Hmmmm. Not good for David Warner. Not good at all. Rabada has been forceful with the new ball and line and length delivery has Warner groping late, edging to the cordon where Erwee takes a very good catch at third slip, tumbling in front of second. 4th over: Australia 9-1 (Warner 3, Labuschagne 0) A small psychological blow then for South Africa, and they would love another with the in-form Labuschagne now at the crease. Nortje lets his former countryman know he’s in the contest with some searing pace, making the new ball launch off this capricious Gabba track like an old school catching cradle. That was very odd from Usman Khawaja. Kagiso Rabada was all over him early in the over, rapping the opener on his gloves, then making him inside-edge onto his thigh. The Australian then left a delivery that missed the off bail by a bee’s wing, swiped an ugly hook that top-edged for two, before stepping to leg and cutting straight to point. Not an innings suggesting a batter with a clear mind. 2nd over: Australia 6-0 (Khawaja 0, Warner 2) Warner looks urgent and focussed against Nortje, defending aggressively, calling loudly, and getting off a pair with a freeing flick off his hip for two. The scoreboard also benefits from four byes when the giant bowler flings down a wild bouncer. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Khawaja 0, Warner 0) Rabada’s rhythm and intent are good with the new ball, but the length is just a fraction short, allowing Khawaja to defend from the crease or leave on height. Maiden. Now, over to David Warner. Usman Khawaja on strike as Australia begin the completion of the formalities. Don’t worry Gavin Robertson (not that one) England’s brave new Ben-and-Bazball is here to save the day. The Proteas could land a couple of psychological blows in the next few minutes, but the result is now no longer in question. Perhaps the only thing we may learn before Australia go 1-0 in front in the series is the frame of mind of David Warner. Horribly out of form, on a pair following his golden duck yesterday, and the subject of intense scrutiny in recent weeks, the veteran must hope to avoid another failure, one that could threaten his immediate future at the top of the order. Zondo ends unbeaten on 36 and his reputation enhanced. Cummins secured the match ball with figures of 5/42. That innings lasted 37.4 deliveries, to go with the 48.2 of the first innings. Not good Test cricket. With Ngidi on strike again at the start of the over Cummins keeps himself on, as a bowling captain is wont to do. He may have been regretting his decision after South Africa’s No 11 pounded a drive through the covers for four, but Cummins exacted swift revenge, sending a bouncer towards Ngidi’s chin, forcing the tailender to fend an edge through to David Warner who barely acknowledges the completion of the dismissal as he turns and hotfoots his way to the pavilion ready to begin Australia’s reply. 37th over: South Africa 95-9 (Zondo 36, Ngidi 5) Ngidi is on strike at the start of Starc’s 11th over, but he’s off it second ball with a slap towards the covers. Somebody on the telly just said, and I kid you not, “a tricky little run chase coming up for Australia”. 36th over: South Africa 94-9 (Zondo 36, Ngidi 4) Cummins continues, searching for a five-for, but Zondo refuses to give his wicket away. He declines the single first ball after pulling into the legside, then he hits a hat-trick of boundaries, the first an inside-edge down to fine-leg, the second a lovely pull miles in front of square leg, and the third a stand-and-deliver straight drive over the bowler’s head. Zondo now has his highest Test score, and survives a very optimistic REVIEW for a catch behind after missing a delivery that cuts in considerably. “Echo the disappointment of commentators,” emails Paul Duggan. “SA batting awful technique to this occasional watcher haven’t seen enough of Aussie batsmen to comment. I wonder if one day and slash bash cricket are influencing modern test play? Bowlers good but hardly a test for them on such a wicket.” 35th over: South Africa 82-9 (Zondo 24, Ngidi 4) Nice from Zondo, pushing Starc into the covers and running hard for two. A swipe across the line is fortunate to land safely in the on-side, then he accepts the single after repelling a toe-crushing thunderbolt. Ngidi survives his two deliveries, Starc whistling the first just past the off stump, and the second is a full toss. 34th over: South Africa 79-9 (Zondo 21, Ngidi 4) The hat-trick ball is rank, allowing Zondo to flick a short delivery off his hip down to fine leg. He retains the strike this time, and demonstrates the logic next ball by guiding an upper cut over the cordon for four. A couple of dots follow then a squirty inside-edge allows Zondo to walk to the non-striker’s end and leave Ngidi just one delivery to face – which he defends competently. 33rd over: South Africa 74-9 (Zondo 16, Ngidi 4) Zondo accepts a single from the first ball of Starc’s over. That is Boycottian levels of someone playing for their average. Ngidi holds his end up though, just, even equalling his Test average with a thick edge that scuttles down to third for four. Cummins will have that hat-trick opportunity… 32nd over: South Africa 69-9 (Zondo 15, Ngidi 0) Alex Webster is “definitely feeling a bit queasy. There’s an argument that Test cricket peaked about 20 years ago and we’re sliding fast down the other side now. South Africa not playing Tests would be an absolute body blow. West Indies (recent Eng series aside) have been bad for a while and we’ve had time to get used to it.” Yep, the big three have plenty to answer for with their carve up of the international game. Nortje comes and goes in the blink of an eye. His first delivery is classic Cummins and all he can manage is a thick outside edge that flies to the enormous matter-swallowing black hole that is Cameron Green at gully. Can Cummins finish it off with a hat-trick? Cummins shares duties with Starc after tea and he fizzes a couple of deliveries past Rabada’s outside edge before dropping in a very slippery bumper that has the batter swaying out of the way late. The follow up is another line and length delivery slanting across, and Rabada gets a nick this time. Carey does the rest. Simply magnificent bowling. 31st over: South Africa 69-7 (Zondo 15, Rabada 3) Starc’s second ball after tea is too quick for Rabada who fends at thin air. The left-arm pacer is bowling over the wicket to the left-handed batter, and he almost sneaks a yorker through Rabada’s defence but the South African gets his bat down in the nick of time. The Proteas hit the front! The players are back out for the final session of the day match. Scores are level, South Africa have three second innings wickets remaining. Mitchell Starc has the ball in his left hand. “Looking at the pitch, the only thing I can say is that if you have such a green top like that it’s not SA that’s getting skewered but the ground staff in Brisbane,” emails Steve Eggson, not unfairly. “That pitch is way too bowler friendly. Of course, as someone who likes their Test cricket slightly bowler friendly, I’m enjoying this immensely but I don’t think it’s South Africa’s fault.” The quality of the pitch was discussed in depth by Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer, with both concluding it was poor, and the worst either had seen in their professional careers at the Gabba. The view from South Africa is damning. How are you all feeling about this out there? Are you enjoying watching South Africa be skewered like this? Or, like me, is it leaving you a little queasy about the state of Test cricket? Apropos of nothing, mangoes have been particularly delicious this year. Fruit of the Australian summer so far. 30th over: South Africa 66-7 (Zondo 14, Rabada 1) Zondo looks secure defending on the front foot to Lyon, then rotates the strike with an easy single on the 45. Rabada doesn’t look as comfortable, but he does enough to see South Africa through to tea with the scores level. 29th over: South Africa 64-7 (Zondo 13, Rabada 0) One over remaining before the tea interval. South Africa trail by two runs. We’re not seeing day three. Boland gets a breather, allowing Mitchell Starc to send down one of the greatest deliveries you will ever see not take a wicket. Fast and full, angling in from around the wicket, hitting the pitch and cutting away like an off break to beat the edge of the bat and the off stump. That was outrageous. Maharaj retains his composure and punches a full toss to the cover fence for four. Starc then bowls another ‘how-did-that-not-take-a-wicket’ delivery that ends up cutting the batter in half, clipping the inside edge and scampering away for another boundary… Inevitably, inevitably, Starc gets his man. Line and length, the batter gets trapped on the crease (understandably) and fends an edge through to Carey. Magnificent bowling. 28th over: South Africa 56-6 (Zondo 13, Maharaj 8) A boundary! Maharaj is quick to rock back when Lyon drops short and cracks the ball behind point for four. This summer so far “has been a disaster for Test cricket” laments Justin Langer on the telly, with the Proteas quickly going the same way as West Indies. For fans of good Test cricket, Pakistan v England is about to resume on day two of the third Test. 27th over: South Africa 51-6 (Zondo 13, Maharaj 3) Let Boland be Boland, as Aaron Sorkin might write. The big Victorian just keeps putting the ball in the right areas, making Zondo play every ball, testing the front pad and the outside edge of the bat. The result is a maiden as South Africa stagger towards the tea interval dazed and confused. 26th over: South Africa 51-6 (Zondo 13, Maharaj 3) Maharaj earns a couple by stepping out and driving Lyon through the covers, but the ball is moving a long long way from off to leg to the right-hander, suggesting there’s a ball with Maharaj’s name on it at any moment. He survives for now. 25th over: South Africa 49-6 (Zondo 12, Maharaj 1) Well done Scott Boland. His average returns to 10.36 after creeping over 11 before his double-wicket over. But if Marco Jansen is a Test No 7, I’ve been watching the wrong sport for 40 years. 18 runs behind, barely five sessions into the Test, and South Africa are already down to their tail to somehow take the game into a third day. Bleurgh… Jansen, like Verreynne lasts only two balls before Boland crashes into the top of off. Beautiful bowling, exploiting the conditions. Ghastly batting from a side abysmally prepared for this challenge. The star of South Africa’s first innings lasts only two deliveries this time around. Boland does what Boland does, the batter gets the edge you’d expect and Smith does the rest at second slip. ABC cricket. All four Australian bowlers now have a wicket to their name. 24th over: South Africa 47-4 (Zondo 12, Verreynne 0) There have been multiple potential wicket balls every over this innings with Australia’s pacemen, and now spinner, taking advantage of the helpful conditions. It might be time for the Proteas to throw caution to the wind and take the Travis Head approach. Lovely shot from Bavuma, reverse sweeping Lyon for four. South Africa are trying to be proactive against the spinner… and the following delivery it all comes unstuck. Stock delivery from Lyon to a right-hander, Bavuma goes back, the ball keeps very low, and the bat doesn’t come across the line in time. It looked very out in real time and the DRS review confirms the damage. South Africa still 19 runs behind. This match may not be much longer for this world. 23rd over: South Africa 43-3 (Bavuma 25, Zondo 12) Boland is an unrelenting bowler, probing continually with his line and length. A tight over goes for just one single and ends with the seamer appealing for an LBW nobody else with an Australian accent seemed interested in. 22nd over: South Africa 42-3 (Bavuma 24, Zondo 12) Complementing Boland’s line and length seam wobble, Lyon is getting appreciable turn and bounce. It would be no surprise if this match ends inside two days – which is the current preoccupation of the Channel 7 commentary team. I’m fine with that, because it means James Brayshaw isn’t able to repeat his suggestion that Lance Morris has great “air speed”. This is much better C7-related content. 21st over: South Africa 41-3 (Bavuma 23, Zondo 12) Boland has the hustle and bustle of a classic strong shouldered English fast-medium seam bowler, and this deck could have been plucked from a northern shire, so an over full of plays and misses outside off stump seems only fair. If anything Clive, some of those deliveries did too much, jagging sharply off the seam as it dug into the lush green surface. 20th over: South Africa 38-3 (Bavuma 20, Zondo 12) Australia’s seamers have bowled well, but now it’s time for the spin of Nathan Lyon. He found serious bounce and no shortage of spin in the first innings, what does he have midway through day two? He has Bavuma second guessing every shot, starting with a line wide of off stump and drawing a missed sweep, then almost creating a chance at short leg but the ball is pushed too firmly down tot he toes of Labuschagne. Zondo then shows his skipper how to sweep effectively, for a single, and Bavuma follows the lead next ball with a near identical shot. Clearly the Proteas have been instructed to sweep Lyon whenever possible. 19th over: South Africa 35-3 (Bavuma 18, Zondo 11) Boland continues, pitching the ball up, and Bavuma is in position nice and early to punch a checked cover drive for a couple. The South African skipper has now faced the most deliveries of any player in the match. The strike is rotated and Boland gets one to nip back at Zondo, but an LBW appeal is stifled by a healthy inside edge. That was Angus Fontaine, I’m Jonathan Howcroft, this is the cricket. Australia well on top and bowling beautifully in helpful conditions, but Bavuma and Zondo are digging in and building the first partnership of the innings. 18th over: South Africa 32-3 (Bavuma 15, Zondo 11) Cummins returns for a ninth over and the first three deliveries are beauties. The fourth has a dash more aggression and it rears up on Zondo as the umpire calls no-ball. Maybe Zondo heard it. He leans back and pulls it to the boundary with an elegant brutality. Both batters are well set now and South Africa are whittling away at this total. The lead is down to 34. Is it time to unleash the GOAT? 17th over: South Africa 27-3 (Bavuma 15, Zondo 7) Speaking of good things coming late to those who wait, here comes Scott Boland, 33-years young, and again planting the first three balls on a penny to keep Bavuma’s growing confidence in check. He scarpers a single on the fifth and despite a run-out attempt which hits the stumps, makes it easily. Boland has now leaked five runs from three overs and his average has blown out to 10.87! 16th over: South Africa 25-3 (Bavuma 13, Zondo 7) This will be Pat Cummins’ eight over of his spell and the way Khaya Zondo climbs into his fourth ball and pounds it to the boundary indicates the skipper might be tiring. That’s Zondo’s first four in 31 balls but it’ll comfort him. Any man who waits almost 33 years for his third Test, knows the value of patience. 15th over: South Africa 21-3 (Bavuma 13, Zondo 3) Boland is back and Bavuma is playing things cautiously. He proved in the first dig that he knows how to mount a rearguard action and he has another one on his hands here. He watches the first three carefully before leaning into the fourth and driving Boland to the rope. Superb shot. The 32-year-old may have only one Test century from his 52 Tests but he looks to know what he’s doing. 14th over: South Africa 17-3 (Bavuma 8, Zondo 3) Cummins resumes, banging it in short but Bavuma is up to it this time, bringing it down with control and scampering a single. Zondo cuts at the next ball but Lyon leaps to his left to field it on the bounce and save more runs. Great stuff. Australia have three slips waiting and Cummins has them licking their lips, sliding another two balls past the nervous hands of Zondo to close it out. 13th over: South Africa 16-3 (Bavuma 8, Zondo 3) Here’s what the crowd craved. Scott Boland replacing Starc. Straight away the journeyman quick curves one past the outside edge of Khaya Zondo. The second tightens the line and grazes the pad as the batter shoulders arms. There are two types of leave and that was a good one. The third and fourth are straight and full. Boland rarely exceeds 130kph but he lands it on a five cent coin every time and that’s how he closes out his first, typically impeccable over of the second innings. Zondo has three runs from his 21 balls and South Africa trail by 50. 12th over: South Africa 16-3 (Bavuma 8, Zondo 3) Apologies for that slight delay as my internet dropped out and I was taunted by Optus ads from the TV. South Africa trail by 54 and the crowd are buzzing as people’s hero Scott Boland runs through some warmup exercises on the boundary. For now it’s captain Pat Cummins rolling into his sixth over to Bavuma. The compact righthander had faced 21 balls for his four runs until he stepped out to the second delivery of this over and uncoiled a lovely cover drive for his first boundary. The next ball draws the edge through, bouncing twice in front of Usman Khawaja, and the last tantalises outside off. Honours even. 7th over: South Africa 3-2 (Erwee 1, Bavuma 0) South Africa trail by 63 with eight wickets in hand. Starc, with 1 for 1 from his three overs is into his fourth. Bavuma looks flummoxed, fronting up with a straight bat only to watch it whistle past. He finds the sweet spot on the third ball but Starc stoops to collect it and cut off any chance of a run. The big quick from Homebush High has 300 wickets and now back-to-back maiden overs. 6th over: South Africa 3-2 (Erwee 1, Bavuma 0) The Australians are all smiles as they return for the second session. Perhaps they popped some bubbly for Mitchell Starc’s 300th wicket? Or could it just be the festive effect of the Christmas ham in its umpteenth incarnation? From the first three balls, all delivered at a good clip, Captain Cummins certainly got some pork on his fork. After challenging the outside edge of Erwee he has bounced him then thundered one into his pads drawing an appeal but no referral. The skipper, perhaps chastened by his foolhardy dismissal, is digging deep with the ball, closing out an incredible over with another peach outside and over off peg. Cheers as well to Andrew Watson who emails: “Thank you for not explaining why Cameron Green is known as ‘the big Sandgroper’”. No worries, Andrew. But please email again if you want answers and I’ll be happy to throw in the origins of ‘Bananabender’ and ‘Croweater’ for free. Players are back on the field and Pat Cummins is at the top of his mark. Let’s get ready to rumble. Hello again, while the players and officials are at lunch Paul in Perth has been in touch. Allow me to confirm for Paul and all that the South Africans are 3 for 2 – ie. two wickets down for three runs – not 2 for 3. Seems I veered briefly into the Australian-style not the preferred English and offended South Africans who didn’t appreciate their scoresheet looking even more parlous than it already is! To honour convention it will hereafter be listed in the runs-wickets format. Let’s just hope the Proteas stagger past 10 runs to make it clearer for everyone. 5th over: South Africa 3-2 (Erwee 1, Bavuma 0) Starc’s third over starts waywardly, two balls sprayed down the legside so Bavuma doesn’t have to play. The stout South African, arms like Christmas hams, is happy to let them pass and make it to lunch. But he’s shuffling across his stumps to get in front of a fuller third ball and after lavishly leaving a fourth Starc dangles outside off, again moves across the crese to get in front of the fifth. So far in fact there’s an appeal for LBW. Cummins and Carey aren’t interested but Starc wants it. Sorry Mitch, not even with 300 wickets against your name, will sway big Pat on this one and DRS go to lunch untroubled. Not so the Proteas. This game is on fast-forward and they have a rollercoaster to ride in the second session just to whittle back the 66 lead Australia established this morning. Speaking of Christmas hams, I’m off to lunch too. See you shortly. 4th over: South Africa 2-3 (Erwee 1, Bavuma 0) Australia are turning the screws here. Cummins and Starc have wiped out the top-order and Nathan Lyon has now twice saved runs with dives. The men in baggy green are racing between wickets to get another Starc over in and despite the South African batters dawdling, the umpires will allow it. Uh-oh. 3rd over: South Africa 2-3 (Erwee 1, Bavuma 0) Starc has his 300th! And what a trademark Mitchell Starc way to get it. A fast ball delivered high from a long left arm that fell like a guillotine blade and looped a smoking ball, seam up, full and fast past the bat of Rassie van der Dussen to splatter the stumps in all directions. Starc joins an elite club with that dismissal and his often frowny face suddenly sports a smile like a slashed watermelon as teammates and the umpires congratulate him. Lovely moment for all. 3rd over: South Africa 1-3 (Erwee 1, vd Dussen 0) What a duel we have here. Mitchell Starc with his dander up and Rassie van der Dussen dancing like a cat on a hot tin roof to survive. The crowd are baying for blood now. 2nd over: South Africa 1-2 (Erwee 0, vd Dussen 0) Poor old Rassie van der Dussen had his pads on but his feet up. He might’ve blown the froth off a Gatorade to celebrate restricting Australia’s lead to 66. Now he’s hopping around at the crease, evading Pat Cummins’ fireballs with his skipper in the sheds and his side reeling again at 1 for 2. It was a pearler from Cummins, plumb LBW and just taking the top layer of varnish off the bails. 2nd over: South Africa 0-0 (Erwee 0, Elgar 2) Sarel Erwee saw off the first over from Starc without scoring (or succumbing). Now his skipper, the veteran Dean Elgar, will try and do likewise against his opposing captain Cummins. He goes one better, flat-batting him down the ground for two runs. But it’s a trap! Cummins squares him up on the next one, raps him on the pad roll and the umpire’s finger goes skyward. Elgar has asked for the technology to intervene but with the naked eye he looked GORN… 1st over: South Africa 0-0 (Erwee 0, Elgar 0) Mitchell Starc charges in for the first over of South Africa’s second innings sitting and seething on 299 Test wickets and hunting platinum membership of the ‘300 Club’. He extracts shape from the first two and then turns Sarel Erwee inside-out on the third with an unplayable, nigh perfect delivery too good for the batter’s edge. A tricky session awaits the Proteas openers here – 20 hot minutes of heat. Starc has sent the warning shot. Cummins to take the new ball at the other end. Australia lead by 66 but they will be disappointed by this morning’s events. After Head and Green rattled through the opening overs with ease, carting boundaries and tickling singles, the innings has quickly collapsed as Starc, Cummins and Lyon all fell cheaply. It left Alex Carey, who was in fine fettle, stranded on a well made 22 and gifted fat bowling stats to a South African attack that were below their best. Strange days. Perhaps the lack of wag in the home side’s tail points to their bowler’s enthusiasm to rip in afresh on a Gabba pitch playing against type by favouring ball over bat. We will see. Have the Proteas batters learned the harsh lessons of the first innings? Or have the Australian pace cartel set them up for a 1-2 knockout? Play is about to resume for 23 minutes so let’s find out… AUSTRALIA all out for 218. 50th over: Australia 218-9 (Carey 22, Lyon 0) Australia’s innings hangs by a thread but Alex Carey will not be cowed. He scampers a single from Rabada’s first delivery, showing trust in Nathan Lyon’s ability with the blade which, as it turns out, is not warranted. Lyon gets a thick edge to Rabada’s third ball and after the starting the day in a shambles Rabada is heading for the showers with 4 for 76 as Australia fall to 218 all out. 50th over: Australia 217-9 (Carey 21, Lyon 0) For a handsome man that was an ugly innings by Pat Cummins. He flinched at the first two and swung hard and hopeful at the third to give Nortje an easy catch and Rabada his first scalp of the day. He’s left Australia in a hole, Carey without a partner and shown awkward evidence of why he’s slipped down the batting order after showing such abundant promise as a batter in his early career. The redoubtable Nathan Lyon has replaced him at the crease and as the 17th over the day ticks over Australia have yielded 71 runs and bled four wickets. They would’ve hoped for better I’d venture. South Africa will be skipping. 49th over: Australia 213-7 (Carey 14, Cummins 0) Cummins survives a scare on his first ball. The skipper looked decidedly uncomfortable swaying out of the path off a rising ball. He doesn ‘t look good against the next on either. Or the third which he hoiks skyward… 49th over: Australia 213-7 (Carey 14, Cummins) That was a great catch by Ngidi. Never easy to run in full-tilt, deliver a fireball then recallibrate to balance yourself and catch a ball rattling back at you. It’s the first caught and bowled in his 50 Test wickets and it’s one the Proteas needed. Australia’s captain has entered the fray… and may be about to exit it. There’s an appeal and the decision is OUT but it may have come off the arm guard. 48th over: Australia 202-7 (Carey 14, Starc 14) Lungi Ngidi has entered the attack for the first time and Mitchell Starc extends a warm welcome to his first delivery, a juicy fruit duly dispatched to the rope. Carey scampers two from the third ball, showing the toe that made him such a promising AFL footballer for a time. Still, Kevin Sheedy’s loss at the GWS Giants has become Australian cricket’s gain as the gloveman from Glenelg goes to 17 from 22. 47th over: Australia 202-7 (Carey 13, Starc 10) We’re back after a quick neck oiling and Carey’s thirst is whet further by a juicy first ball on his hips from Rabada. Although he’s been a dervish of positive energy, Carey is still without a boundary from his 14 runs and here he contents himself with a clipped single. Starc oozes laconic energy until he opens those shoulders and swings to the stars but Rabada is still extracting steepling bounce from the pitch and the big Australian fastbowler has to bide his time. 46th over: Australia 202-7 (Carey 13, Starc 9) Carey clips Jansen onto the onside to bring up the Australian 200 and Starc taps a single. These two have the strike rotating nicely, never allowing the bowlers to pin them down and get into rhythm. Jansen knows it too. He comes around the wicket and bends like a safety pin to get the ball skything past Starc’s stubble. Drinks. 45th over: Australia 199-7 (Carey 10, Starc 8) Kagiso Rabada is the leader of this Proteas attack but he was loose and expensive in his first spell. Captain Elgar banished him to the deep to cool his heels awhile and now he’s back. The hackles are up and he’s running in hard, albeit to a stubbornly defensive field. He has Carey hopping with the first three deliveries but slackens slightly to allow a single from the fourth. Starc sees out the over. Australia lead by 47. 44th over: Australia 198-7 (Carey 8, Starc 8) Carey and Starc aren’t going into their shell here. Even against the pace of Jansen, the scoreboard is ticking over at just under a run-a-ball. If the Test has shown us anything so far it’s that batters, once established, can score freely. Australia threw the first punches this morning, then South Africa countered with the wickets of Head and Green. Now Australia are consolidating and the Test is teetering in the balance, ready to be taken by the scruff of the neck. 43rd over: Australia 197-7 (Carey 8, Starc 8) Nortje thunders in amidst 50% humidity at the Gabba. This is a vital partnership. Alex Carey knows how to bat time. The diminutive wicketkeeper has climbed to a respectable 33-plus batting average from his 13 Tests so far but is yet to notch a century (his highest score is 93). Conversely, Starc loves to live by the Lance Cairns credo of ‘give it a heave’ but is watchful against the speed and guile of Nortje… until he isn’t. Bored and beligerent, he heaves the final ball to the rope. 42nd over: Australia 192-7 (Carey 7, Starc 4) Marco Jansen is showing why South Africa have won their last three series in Australia. He has 3 for 23 from his six overs. That said, Alex Carey is a man in form with gloves and willow at the moment, and he shows why on Jansen’s second delivery, hoiking it square and running four. After Carey taps a single and Starc swerves inside some chin music, Australia take their lead to 40. 41st over: Australia 187-7 (Starc 4, Carey 1) South Africa have done it again, taking wickets in clumps to derail Australia’s momentum. This time it is Head, out in the 90s for the second time this summer, getting some glove on a rising ball from Jansen he was looking to squirt down the legside. Although he reviewed the decision, Head looked sheepish from the get-go and so it proved as Snicko showed a clear flutter. He’s got to go and suddenly Australia have two fresh batters at the crease and the door is ajar for the Proteas to wrap up the tail and keep the lead (currently 35) small. Starc joins Carey and having clattered a boundary from his first ball from Nortje, shows again that he’s here for a good time not a long time. 40th over: Australia 182-6 (Head 92, Carey 1) Green was every inch the impetuous youth there. He moved late and pushed hard to a fast angled ball in the corridor of uncertainty and got a healthy edge which flew into the slips where it was juggled, ballooning high, before being pouched by Sarel Erwee. South African tails are up! 39th over: Australia 174-5 (Head 89, Green 14) As predicted, Rabada has been put on ice and the dangerous Marco Jansen enters the attack. He has 1 for 18 already and looks full of beans this morning. 38th over: Australia 178-5 (Head 89, Green 18) Green has spanked three boundaries so far, all down the ground through long off, and he swipes Nortje to the rope on the first delivery. There is ominous intent in this strokeplay by the Australian batters. The Proteas need to tighten up fast or these two will take the game from them very quickly. Australia has rattled off 33 but Nortje’s final ball, a scorcher that narrowly whistles past the edge of Green’s bat, injects a bit of hope for the visitors. 37th over: Australia 174-5 (Head 89, Green 14) Head plunders his way past 2000 Test runs off Rabada’s second ball, a short wide ball on the offside. He steals another three runs to move to 89 and when Green moves calmly onto the front foot to pump Rabada down the ground for another boundary, Dean Elgar sends the signal for Marco Jansen to warm-up for an early blast. Rabada has woken up on the wrong side and cost his side five runs an over so far. 36th over: Australia 166-5 (Head 86, Green 9) Nortje’s first ball of his 10th over is on the button but the second strays down leg side and Travis Head slides it off his hip to the fine leg boundary. The third is on an off side line but Head skips inside it and clips it close to the rope for more runs. He squirts another two square and cuts for a single to move to 86 from 92 balls and retain the strike for the next over from Rabada. 36th over: Australia 157-5 (Head 81, Green 9) After some advice/ admonishment from skipper Dean Elgar, Kagiso Rabada has tightened up his line and length. Green can’t get any of the first four deliveries away but when Rabada errs and it’s in the slot Green leans in and taps it with a tremendous crack to send the ball careering down the ground for a four. Lovely shot by the big Sandgroper. He has his eye in now and looks to have slept well. 35th over: Australia 153-5 (Head 81, Green 5) Anrich Nortje, already with 2 for 37 from his first day’s toil, is partnering Rabada and he’ll want to do better than his mate did in his opening over. He does. The first two are bang on the money and Head parries them back. He lashes at the third but it doesn’t hit the middle and Nortje fields it easily off his own bowling. Head is jumping at the fourth as it angles across his body. He wants a single but Green smartly sends him back. The youngster is happy at the none-striker’s end, still aglow from that silky drive down the ground in the previous over. 34th over: Australia 153-5 (Head 81, Green 5) Green is off the mark, nudging Rabada down the ground for a single off the first while Head misses the chance to blaze two half-volleys through the gaps, finding the field each time. He makes no mistake off the fourth long-hop and crunches it to the rope for three. Inspired, Green clobbers the last one down the ground for a boundary. Bright start by the men in baggy greens The players are on the field. Here comes Travis Head swaggering to the middle with the long tall drink of water that is Cameron Green trailing behind. The big allrounder is 17 Tests into his career but has looked every inch the rookie lately. Can he dust off the cobwebs and find some time in the middle? Mr Rabada, who opens the attack, will have plenty to say about it. 34th over: Australia 145-5 (Head 78, Green 0) Congrats to Mike in East Maitland, home to that prince of the ring Les Darcy, who answered correctly that Dale Steyn is the other South African speedster to hail from Uitenhage. Like Steyn once did, Nortje tends for the title of fastest bowler in the world right now. He made his name as a T20 sensation in the Indian Premier League, but now has 57 wickets from his 15 Tests so far at the impressive average of 27.52. Doubtless the Australians studied his barrages on the flat Pakistan decks and knew he’d take to Australian conditions with gusto. He will be primed for a big morning under the Brisbane sun today. There’s still time to catch up with all the Day 1 action. Read Geoff Lemon’s report It’s a sunny Sunday here in Brisbane. The Gabba ground staff are lending last minute additions to this blazing green-top and South Africa’s speedster Anrich Nortje is talking about the origin of his fearsome pace: the run-up apparently, not the pantomime twirling of what is his splendid fast-bowler’s moustache. The burly 29-year-old certainly troubled the Australian batters yesterday, nudging 150km/h and finding good lines. Perhaps those lines and speed emulate that of the Volkswagen factory in his home town of Uitenhage? Q for readers: Which other Proteas pace great hailed from this town, north of Port Elizabeth? Morning all and welcome to Day 2 of the First Test: Australia v South Africa. This is the 102nd Test between these great cricketing nations over 120 years of competition and every fibre of that fierce rivalry was on show yesterday as 29,306 fans piled into the Gabba to witness a thrilling day of seesawing action. Under cloudy skies, Australian captain Pat Cummins, usually a proponent of solar power, won the toss and made the bold gambit to bowl first. But that decision paid off in spades. South Africa were skittled for just 152 inside 50 overs, the last six wickets falling for 27. Their blushes were saved only by a partnership of 98 between Temba Bavuma and wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne. Australia’s ebullience lasted one delivery, as Kagiso Rabada speared the fresh cherry off the green-top Gabba pitch and straight into David Warner’s heart. The 99-Test opener, two years without a century and averaging 21.8 since 2020, flinched and blinked, fending the ball to a high flying Khaya Zondo at short leg for his second golden duck in 181-innings. And when Marnus Labuschagne was undone by Marco Jansen and Anrich Nortje bamboozled Usman Khawaja, Australia were three for 27 and it was game on. If Sandpapergate, and the last hostile meeting between these sides in 2018, still rubs Steve Smith raw it sure didn’t show. He spanked his first ball for four and, with a typically cavalier Travis Head in tow, put on 113 in 23 overs to wrestle back the ascendency. But then a late twist: Smith bowled by Nortje for 36 and nightwatchman Scott Boland nicking off to leave in flux at Australia 145 for five. Will Travis Head roll on from his unbeaten 78?

A bulletin from Frontier Economics, a firm that has provided modelling on energy and climate policy for the government, found if the states delivered on their expected commitments, the country would make at least a 33% cut in emissions by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. The federal Coalition’s target is a 26-28% cut. It claimed last week that official emissions projections showed the country was on track to meet it. In reality, the report found emissions were projected to be just 22% below 2005 levels in 2030. National emissions are already about 16% below 2005 levels, and the official projections found they were likely to fall by only another 6.8% over the next 10 years. Analysts said this was due to a lack of federal climate policy. But the federal data does not yet include the New South Wales renewable energy legislation that recently passed state parliament and should underwrite 12 gigawatts of solar and wind – roughly equivalent to all the clean generation in the national grid – over the next decade. With all states having a target or aspiration of net zero emissions by 2050 – a goal the Morrison government is resisting – Frontier Economics looked at what state governments planned to do over the next decade and found, as a result, a national 33% cut was a conservative estimate. Most of the heavy lifting would be done by NSW, Victoria and Queensland. Matt Harris, the firm’s head of climate change and renewables, said debate in Australia remained stuck on whether the country could meet its target when this was now a non-issue, and the real question was how much more it should be doing. In 2015, the Climate Change Authority’s advice was equivalent to a 45-65% cut. Harris said action to date showed deeper cuts in emissions by 2030 would not be a “wrecking ball through the economy”, as the federal emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, claimed before the last election. “They should at least be investigating doing more,” Harris said. “Clearly you can drop the plan to use the Kyoto [carryover] credits – you’re just not going to need them. “It is also important to remember the targets are arbitrary. If you have already met the target, why don’t you reconsider it? I think that’s what should come next.” Harris said the main casualty of the focus on whether targets could be met had been Labor re-considering its commitment to a 45% emissions target for 2030 on the basis it would be too hard to meet, when the evidence suggested otherwise. He said the states were the “saving grace” on emissions reductions. NSW has a 35% target for 2030, Queensland a 30% target, and the analysis assumes Victoria will eventually opt for a 45% goal (expert advice recommended a cut of between 45% and 60%). The Morrison government was embarrassed last week when the prime minister was denied a speaking slot at a global climate ambition summit hosted by Britain, France and the UN. Leaders were told they would be offered a speaking berth only if they planned to make new climate commitments. The prime minister had planned to announce the government was “very confident” it would not have to use the carryover credits from the expiring Kyoto protocol to meet its Paris target. But the international community had already signalled its opposition to the credits being used, with the plan having been described as “cheating” after the last major climate conference, and dropping the idea was not seemed a significant enough step forward. Australia joined Brazil, Russia, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand in not being offered a speaking slot. Morrison instead made his planned announcement at a Pacific Islands forum on Friday night. More than 70 countries spoke at the summit. Commitments before or at the event included: Britain pledging a 68% emissions cut by 2030 compared with 1990 levels and saying it would stop financing fossil fuel projects abroad. Canada saying it would raise its carbon price to C$15 a tonne a year from 2023 to reach C$170 by 2030. Germany promising nearly €500m in international climate finance, on top of its existing commitment of €4bn a year. Finland, Austria and Sweden setting net zero targets for 2035, 2040 and 2045 respectively. Pakistan saying it would scrap plans for new power plants. The European Union backing a 55% emissions cut by 2030 compared with 1990. Barbados and the Maldives saying they were aiming to be carbon neutral by 2030. Japan and South Korea, which both recently announced net zero targets for 2050, saying they would soon increase their 2030 goals. Japan also pledged $1.5bn for the green climate fund to help developing countries. China, which in September surprised the world by setting a net zero goal for no later than 2060, marginally strengthened its 2030 goals, including that it would get about 25% of its primary energy from non-fossil fuels by 2030. It would have about 1,200 gigawatts of installed wind and solar power. Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told the summit: “China always honours its commitments.” But some observers were disappointed that China and India, which repeated a pledge to double its renewable energy target to 450 gigawatts by 2030, had not gone further and called for greater commitments before the next major climate conference in Glasgow next year. The US was not at the event, but president-elect Joe Biden has promised to rejoin the Paris agreement and host his own climate summit of major economies within 100 days of taking office. The UK’s business secretary, Alok Sharma, who will be president of the Glasgow event, told the weekend summit that the world was not on track to fulfil the Paris agreement and limit global heating to 1.5C. Australia’s official emissions projections suggest the country will be just 22% below 2005 by 2030 without the use of carryover credits, but also says emissions could be reduced by 29% if the government’s technology investment roadmap policy is counted. It is not clear from the document how the latter number is reached. Analysts from RepuTex said the roadmap was not expected to lead to cuts over the next decade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/jul/15/china-slowdown-global-economy-uk-real-wages-cars-heathrow-strikes-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-15T14:30:58Z","webTitle":"Company insolvencies jump 40% in England and Wales; China’s growth slumps – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/jul/15/china-slowdown-global-economy-uk-real-wages-cars-heathrow-strikes-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/jul/15/china-slowdown-global-economy-uk-real-wages-cars-heathrow-strikes-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Company insolvencies jump 40% in England and Wales; China’s growth slumps – as it happened","bodyText":"Stock markets are ending the week on a positive note, as investors regain their nerve despite the latest signs of economic slowdown. In London, the FTSE 100 is now 112 points higher, or 1.6% up, at 7153, led by engineering firm Rolls-Royce (+5.5%), with airline group IAG (+4.4%) close behind. The pound is clawing back from two-year lows, at $1.184, while the euro is back about parity with the dollar at $1.006. Fiona Cincotta, Senior Financial Markets Analyst, at City Index, says: Yesterday saw a disappointing start to the earnings season yesterday after JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley saw net income fall around 30%, missing forecasts. The fact that the banks are setting aside large sums for potential bad loans suggests that they are concerned about a possible recession. Helping stocks higher today have been less hawkish comments from known Federal Reserve hawkish, which have helped the market pare back aggressive Fed hike bets. With hawks Christopher Waller and James Bullard both supporting hiking rates by 75 basis points, not 100 bps that the market priced in after Wednesday’s red hot inflation. Here are today’s main stories: Have a lovely weekend. GW US consumer sentiment has inched up this month, but remains near its lowest in decades. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer morale rose to 51.1 this month, up from 50 in June, and better than hoped. But as Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu explains, consumer sentiment was relatively unchanged, remaining near all-time lows. Current assessments of personal finances continued to deteriorate, reaching its lowest point since 2011. Buying conditions for durables adjusted upwards, owing both to consumers who cited easing supply constraints and those who believed that one should buy now to avoid future price increases, which would exacerbate inflation going forward. Virgin Media O2 has explored making a multi-billion pound offer for broadband and telecoms company TalkTalk in its latest move to build scale to create a new “national champion” to challenge BT and Sky. The pay-TV, broadband and mobile giant, which is jointly owned by Spain’s Telefonica and John Malone’s Liberty Global, is understood to have held exploratory talks with the Salford-based TalkTalk. TalkTalk, founded and chaired by Sir Charles Dunstone, has been in play since April when it emerged that the company had received a number of tentative approaches about a sale. Companies including Vodafone and Sky have previously been linked with potential offers for the business, which was taken private in a £1.8bn deal with Martin Hughes’ Toscafund last year. It is understood that TalkTalk and its bankers Lazard believe the business is now worth as much as £3bn. Virgin Media O2, which is working with LionTree, is understood to have explored the possibility of making an offer for TalkTalk but has not tabled a formal bid. If a deal was to go ahead it would be the first major move by chief executive Lutz Schuler since the £31bn Virgin Media O2 joint venture was formed two years ago. Virgin Media O2’s potential interest in a deal with TalkTalk was first reported by the Telegraph. The UK is poised for a potential wave of consolidation in the telecoms sector with companies such as Vodafone arguing that regulators need to relax their view on competition concerns to bring them more into line with other markets such as the US and parts of Europe. In February, telecoms regulator Ofcom formally dropped its long held position that a merger between any of the UK’s big four mobile operators should be blocked at all costs. Under former chief executive Sharon White, Ofcom was an outspoken opponent of Three UK’s attempted £10.25bn takeover of O2, which was blocked by competition regulators six years ago. Liberty Global, Virgin Media O2 and TalkTalk declined to comment. Shares in BT have dropped 7.5%, to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, since news of Virgin Media O2’s interest broke. Wall Street is bouncing back from its wobble yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 1.2%, or 368 points, in early trading to 30,999 points. Almost every sector is up, led by energy and financials. Fears that the US central bank could lift interest rates by a whole percentage point - for the first time in decades - may be easing of, after Wednesday’s surge in inflation to 9.1%. The decline in US industrial production and manufacturing output in June is partly due to zero-covid shutdowns in China, suspects Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics. Those lockdowns temporarily paralysed global supply chains again, adding to weaker demand for US goods as economic demand slows. Pearce told clients: What had been surprising is how well activity in the factory sector had held up in recent months, but the downward revisions to the May data and further decline in June now match the downbeat message from the survey data that manufacturing activity has slowed, and mirrors the broader slowdown in global manufacturing output. With activity in China rebounding, however, and inventory across most of the economy still looking lean, US manufacturing output growth should slow rather than collapse. US manufacturing output has weakened, indicating that the factory sector eased off last month. Total industrial production dipped 0.2% percent in June, new figures show, while manufacturing output declined 0.5% for a second consecutive month. Both readings are weaker than expected, taking the shine off the stronger-than-forecast retail sales figures earlier. The European Commission is proposing a ban on the import of Russian gold, as part of an adjustment to its sanctions regime following the Ukraine invasion. A package agreed by the EC today would introduce a new import ban on Russian gold, aligning EU sanctions with those of its G7 partners.. The package also reiterates that EU sanctions do not target in any way the trade in agricultural products between third countries and Russia, in an attempt to protect food security around the world (already threatened by the blockage on Ukrainian grain). The EC is also proposing extending the current EU sanctions for six months, until the next review at the end of January 2023. The proposal will now be discussed by EU member states. Rail passengers across England and Wales have been urged to only travel if necessary next week, with extreme temperatures forcing blanket speed restrictions across much of the network. Network Rail said the impact on train services would vary by region, but that journeys would take significantly longer. It said there was a high likelihood of cancellations, delays and last-minute alterations to services on Monday and Tuesday. Long-distance train journeys, such as London to York, could take four hours instead of two, with trains forced to travel below 60mph for safety. Vulnerable passengers and those with health conditions should avoid travelling, Network Rail said, while passengers who choose to travel should check if their train is running and ensure they are prepared for the heat with plenty of water to drink. Rail passengers in Scotland should also check their journeys before travelling and take sensible precautions. Refuse collection workers in the West Midlands are to strike on the opening week of the Commonwealth Games, PA Media reports. Members of the GMB union will take five days of action - on July 28, when the Games open in Birmingham, July 29 and August 4, 5 and 8. The union said private contractor Serco, which runs refuse collection services across Sandwell, had offered a real terms pay cut to workers. Justine Jones, GMB Midlands organiser, said: “Strike action is a last resort, but Serco top brass have forced the hand of hundreds of hard-working local refuse workers. “Our members have asked for nothing more than a fair pay rise, after keeping communities here in Sandwell clean and safe throughout the pandemic. “The eyes of the world will be on our area during the Commonwealth Games, it’s a shame that Serco have put the bottom line before their own workforce and community in this way. “This is a big distraction from the Games and we hope Serco see sense and urgently bring a pay offer to the table that reflects the hard work and dedication of our members.” Here’s some snap analysis of the US retail sales report: Just in: US retail sales jumped by more than expected last month, as rising inflation drove up prices in the shops and online. Retail sales rose 1.0% in June, ahead of forecasts of a 0.9% rise, and were 8.4% higher than a year before. That follows a 0.1% monthly drop in May (which has been revised up from -0.3%) The figures aren’t adjusted for inflation, and show gasoline stations spending was 49% higher than in June 2021, while food services and drinking places grew sales by 13.4%. It suggests that consumers didn’t cut spending heavily in June, despite a slump in confidence last month as inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1%. That may give the Federal Reserve the green light for another hefty interest rate rises later this month. The head of investment group BlackRock has blamed the toughest investment environment in decades after profits tumbled by almost a third. Net income at BlackRock fell 30% in the second quarter of 2022 to $1.12bn, a bigger fall than expected. Assets under management at the firm dropped by 11% to below $8.5trn. Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and CEO, points out that it’s been a tough year: “The first half of 2022 brought an investment environment that we have not seen in decades. Investors are simultaneously navigating high inflation, rising rates and the worst start to the year for both stocks and bonds in half a century, with global equity and fixed income indexes down 20% and 10%, respectively. “BlackRock generated net inflows of $90 billion in the second quarter demonstrating our ability, once again, to deliver industry-leading organic growth even in the most challenging of environments. Our connectivity with clients has never been stronger. Over the last twelve months, we’ve delivered over $460 billion of net inflows reflecting 5% organic base fee growth. Market volatility has pushed some investors out of the market, and also pushed down the value of assets which managers charge their fees on. Here’s some good analysis: Mazars, the international audit, tax and advisory firm, reports that company insolvences across the UK are up 70% in the last year. Rising interest rates and slowing consumer spending are hitting businesses’ bottom lines, it says, just as costs rise sharply. This squeeze has pushed UK company insolvencies up to 19,191 in the year to 30th June, from 11,261 the previous 12 months -- which chimes with the Insolvency Service’s figures. Construction firms have been particularly badly hit, with insolvencies up 112% in the past year to 3,611 as rising costs for materials and energy made some building projects increasingly unprofitable. Businesses are fighting a losing battle against rising costs – with the added worry of falling consumer spending, warned Rebecca Dacre, partner at Mazars. With energy prices rising, businesses are being forced to increase their prices despite consumers feeling the pinch. Many businesses that were already struggling are now facing a real crisis. Price pressures are becoming more embedded as interest rates rise and the economy contracts. The latest insolvency figures will cast greater uncertainty over businesses that are already facing a grim outlook. “The financial support that the Government provided during the pandemic has now been withdrawn, and the UK economy appears to be seeing the post-Covid wave of insolvencies that were feared. Sadly, the dismal outlook means more pain for businesses is likely.” The number of company insolvencies in England and Wales has risen by 40% year-on-year, as more firms are forced under by tough economic conditions. There were 1,691 company insolvencies in June, the Insolvency Service reports, up from 1,207 in June 2021. That’s also 15% more than before the pandemic, although lower than in May. Most of June’s insolvencies (1,456) were Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidations (CVLs), in which a firm takes the decision to be liquidated because it can’t pay its bills. But there were also 3.6 times as many compulsory liquidations in June 2022 as in June 2021, and the number of administrations was 2.3 times higher than a year ago. John Bell, director of licensed Insolvency Practitioners Clarke Bell, warned that the race to replace Boris Johnson will unsettle businesses: The economy is in a state of flux as the Government goes into freefall and clamours to find a new leader and Prime Minister. The uncertainty is set to stall the economy and unsettle UK plc. Bell adds that companies have been hit by the pandemic, the economic uncertainty caused by Brexit, along with other current events such as the Ukraine war Due to the heavy impact and persistence of these problems, it’s no surprise that many directors of struggling companies are facing compulsory liquidation. However, it is the worst type of liquidation, stripping directors of any control and often ending in personal consequences for directors. As such, it should be avoided at all costs. My advice to struggling businesses is to confront your financial issues before liquidation is forced upon you. There are many methods and steps to take to close down a company before you reach compulsory liquidation stage.” Nicky Fisher, Vice President of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, says inflation is driving up company costs and adding to the strain on bosses: Not only are directors facing immediate strain to deal with this inflationary pressure, but they will also be looking at re-evaluating investment decisions and wider business strategies in the medium-term. This is likely to act as a further drag on the economy in the months ahead. “At the same time, consumer confidence has hit its lowest point since the start of the pandemic, bringing down consumer spending, which could mean that sectors such as travel, retail and hospitality could particularly struggle as these are the things people usually cut first. China’s stock market has posted its biggest drop in eight weeks, as calls for a mortgage strike added to anxiety after the weak GDP report. The CSI 300 closed down 1.7%, its biggest drop since 24th May. Property developers and financial firms were hit by a growing number of homebuyers’ threats to stop mortgage payments on unfinished apartments. Analysts have warned that growing protests over stalled construction projects could threaten any tentative recovery in China’s capital-starved property sector and leave banks with hefty writedowns on bad debts. The 2.6% drop in China’s GDP in the last quarter also weighed on sentiment. For the week, the CSI 300 Index lost 4.1%, the biggest drop since April 22, while the Hang Seng Index saw its biggest slump since March 2020, down 6.6%. British luxury carmaker Aston Martin has turned to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund to help fix its financial woes, sending its shares surging 20% back from record lows. Aston Martin Lagonda has received a large investment from Saudi Arabia as part of raising £650m of capital to pay down the luxury sportscar maker’s large debts, my colleague Jasper Jolly reports. The British manufacturer has not been able to generate cash needed to invest in new models and electric technology, and has also struggled with delays to its Valkyrie hypercar and its newest DBX 707 sports utility vehicle. The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), led by the controversial crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, will buy shares worth £78m, and will take part in a £575m rights issue that will leave it as the second-largest investor after Yew Tree, the consortium led by the billionaire fashion mogul Lawrence Stroll that took over Aston Martin in early 2020 as it approached bankruptcy. Here’s the full story: Soaring energy costs have left the eurozone with another trade deficit in May. Statistics body Eurostat reports that imports into the eurozone jumped by 52% in May compared with a year ago, to €274.8bn. That outpaced exports, which rose almost 29% to €248.5bn. In the first five months of the year, imports from Norway have surged 147%, mainly due to higher expense on oil and gas goods. The United States saw the biggest increase in exports, up 29.6%, lifted by chemicals, machinery and vehicles. The Bloomberg Industrial metals index has slumped to a 17-month low, reports Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo: The sell-off is led by copper which has suffered its worst weekly rout since the early stages of the pandemic in 2020 (see earlier post). Hansen explains: Since hitting a record high in March the price High Grade copper (HGc1) has slumped by 37% to levels last seen in late 2020. From a technical perspective, the price has reached support at $3.14, the 61.8% retracement of the 2020 to 2022 rally, and further weakness may trigger an additional selling response from traders Rio Tinto Group, meanwhile, has issued a grim warning about the prospects for the global economy, pointing to war, inflation and tighter monetary policy, as well as coronavirus lockdowns in China. Mining giant Rio Tinto has warned that the economic outlook is weakening due to the Russia-Ukraine war, tighter monetary policy to curb rising inflation, and targeted COVID-19 restrictions in China. In its latest production results, Rio Tinto flagged a range of headwinds, including shortages of workers, muted demand from Chinese manufacturers, falling commodity prices and the threat of recession. Rio Tinto says: Prices for our commodities decreased in the quarter, amidst growing recession fears and a decline in consumer confidence. Trade disruptions, food protectionism and the global focus on securing energy supplies continue to put pressure on supply chains, which will need to be significantly eased before inflationary pressures subside. On China, the company warns that Covid-19 restrictions are hampering activity: China’s industrial activity troughed in May amid COVID-lockdowns. June recovered but uncertainties remain given the potential for ongoing outbreaks. Economic stability is a focus, but headwinds are considerable from restricted labour and goods movement and a slowing external environment. Rio Tinto says there is an “increasing risk” that a rapid hike in US interest rates will subdue demand. Conditions are worsening in Europe, it adds: The Eurozone industrial sector has been impacted by supply bottlenecks, higher inputs costs and weakening consumer sentiment, even though the services sector has been positive. Energy security will be a key priority for the region, with measures taken to avert a potential shortfall in energy. Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) general secretary Mick Lynch says the public is “right behind” the latest wave of planned industrial walkouts. Asked if public support could “evaporate” over planned strikes on July 27, August 18 and 20, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The public seem to be right behind us, many of the public are in the same position as our members. “They have not had a pay rise, they feel they are being exploited by the employers and they feel that the Government is pushing down on wages in order to protect profits in this country, which are still at higher levels, and dividends are still being paid out. “Corporate Britain is making plenty of money on the back of low-paid workers and our members feature in that, and we need to get a square deal for them so that they can face the cost-of-living challenge which is best addressed through their pay packets.” Copper prices are heading for the worst weekly loss since March 2020 on Friday, as fears of a global recesssion hit the commodities market. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange has dropped over 10% so far this week. It has fallen below $7,000 per tonne this morning for the first time since November 2020 (when the first successful Covid-19 vaccine trials triggered a global rally). Copper prices in Shanghai have closed at their lowest since November 2020 too, weakening as China’s economy shrank by more than forecast in April-June (down 2.6% quarter-on-quarter). ‘Doctor Copper’, as it is known, is a good indicator of the health of the global economy, so this is a concern. Prices have fallen around 35% in the last four months; it surged early in the Ukraine war as traders anticipated supply shortages, before recession fears pulled prices down. Ongoing Covid-19 lockdowns in China will limit factory output, and thus demand for commodities such as metals. The stronger US dollar has also pushed down commodity prices (which are priced in dollars), while higher interest rates in the US and Europe could also dent demand. Energy rationing in Europe this winter could aldo hammer demand for metals, if Russia were to keep the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline closed once its summer maintenance finishes. Things have turned sour in the swanky tonic market. Fevertree, the premium carbonated mixer maker, has cut its profit forecasts and warned that logistic problems and rising costs have “significantly worsened in recent months”, including shortages of workers and glass bottles. The news sent Fevertree’s shares tumbling by a quarter this morning to 900p. Shares are down almost two-thirds so far this year, as inflationary pressures have pushed up costs and squeezed consumer spending. Fevertree was a stock market darling up until 2018, as its high-end tonics proved a hit with drinkers. The company insists that consumer demand remains strong, but now expects profits of £37.5m-£45m, down from an earlier forecast of £63m-£66m, adding: Labour shortages have impacted our US East Coast production ramp up, resulting in greater UK production required to fulfil against the strong demand in the US, and with it, more exposure to sea freight with rates increasing by up to 50% since the start of the year on key routes Glass availability has become severely restricted, which has limited the opportunity to deliver upside to revenue despite strong demand Further, industry-wide cost pressures have increased, most notably glass costs, where we will see double digit increases for H2 alongside continued logistics cost increases and disruption Burberry are the top faller on the FTSE 100 share index, down 4%. Overall, the market is recovering around half of its losses yesterday, with the blue-chip share index up 50 points at 7090. European stocks are rallying too, with Germany’s DAX up 1.1%. China’s lockdowns have hit sales growth at Burberry. The luxury fashion company has reported that sales in mainland China plunged by 35% in the last quarter, when Covid-19 lockdowns forced stores to close. That pulled sales across the Asia Pacific down by 16%. Declines in Mainland China were partially offset by strong performances in recovering markets such as Japan, though. Sales outside Mainland China were up 16%, as countries reopened from the pandemic, meaning total sales grew 1%. Burberry has also suffered from the drop in Chinese tourists visiting Europe, due to zero-Covid policies, although a pick-up in American visitors may help. Sales in the Europe, Middle East, India and Africa region rose 47%, with local sales exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, explains: “Burberry’s trading progress has been hampered by another China crisis resulting from the country’s zero tolerance policy on Covid-19. The lack of Asian tourists coming to Europe in particular has been a bugbear for some considerable time, and the latest lockdowns in the region have inevitably had an impact. Asia Pacific sales overall declined by 16%, with sales in Mainland China dropping by 35% following store closures and lockdowns which also affected Burberry’s digital hub. Interestingly, ING suspect China’s downturn may have bottomed out. They’ve revised up their target for China’s GDP growth rate for 2022 to 4.4% from 3.6% previously, on the It is still slower than the government target of 5.5% for this year, which ING believes will be hard to achieve unless a lot of investment goes into construction work. Iris Pang, ING’s chief economist for Greater China, suspects China’s recovery could have begun, despite the 2.6% tumble in April-June. We have seen a recovery in retail sales at 3.1%YoY in June from -6.7%YoY in May, with car sales increasing by 13.9%YoY in June from -5.9%YoY in May, mainly because of subsidies for the consumption of new energy cars. We expect strong retail sales to continue as some local governments have not completed their subsidy programmes. Fixed assets investment data are even more forward-looking. Infrastructure investments grew 6.1%YoY year-to-date amounting to CNY 27.1 trillion. Manufacturing investments took the lead by growing 10.4%YoY YTD. The data suggests companies are optimistic about their buisness prospects. Infrastructure investments rose 7.1%YoY YTD, and we believe they will speed up further in the third quarter. Industrial production rose 3.9%YoY in June from 0.7% in May. New energy cars, solar power batteries and telecommunication stations grew 111.2%YoY, 31.8%YoY and 19.8%YoY, respectively. We believe that subsidies for consumption on new energy cars is one of the factors for such fast growth in production. Faster growth in industrial production will typically push up PPI inflation later. The government is trying to curb inflation so that it can avoid the high readings seen in the US and other economies. China’s economy faces a fog of uncertainty, warns Alvin Tan of Royal Bank of Canada: China Q2 GDP growth at 0.4% y/y was lower than consensus expectations, but still better than the probable figure. Growth for H1 2022 was just 2.5%, which suggests that the 5.5% target for the entire year is very unlikely to be reached. New build housing prices fell for a tenth consecutive month in June at 0.10% m/m, but the rate of decline is slowing. Although the spring lockdown-driven downturn is now behind us, the path ahead for China’s economy is fogged by the uncertainties flowing from zero-Covid, the fragile property sector and the global growth slowdown. China’s slowdown could prompt action by central bankers and Beijing’s government, says Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management: China data may look bad overall, but industrial output, retail sales, Fixed Asset Invement and jobless rates improved after a brief respite from the zero-covid policy in June. China’s 5.5% 2022 GDP target now looks impossible to achieve, and we concur with the China experts forecasting 4% instead. But we could easily read the big GDP miss as “bad news is good “as it should signal a call to action for both fiscal and monetary authorities. Asia-Pacific stock markets are hovering around two-year lows, after China’s GDP report missed expectations. China’s CSI 300 share index has dropped by 1.25% in late trading, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng is down 2%, and Japan’s Topix is flat. So far this year, new car registrations in the EU have shrunk by 14.0% compared with a year ago. All of the region’s major markets have recorded double-digit drops, with Italy (-22.7%) worst hit, followed by France (-16.3%), Germany (-11.0%) and Spain (-10.7%). European car sales have tumbled to their lowest since 1996, as automakers are hit by persistent supply chain snarls and record inflation. In another sign of economic problems, new car sales in the EU fell by 15.4% in June to just 886,510 units, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association reports. That’s the worst June in 25 years, and means new car registrations have fallen for 12 months in a row. All four of the major European Union markets - Spain, Italy, Germany and France - reported a decline in car registrations Germany posted the strongest decline (-18.1%), followed by Italy (-15.0%) and France (-14.2%). Spain on the other hand saw a more modest fall (-7.8%). Figures earlier this month showed that the UK also posted its worst June car sales since 1996. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. Fears over the global economy have been sharpened by the news that China’s growth took a shunt in the last quarter, as Covid-19 outbreaks and restrictions hit the economy. China’s economy shrank by 2.6% in the April-June quarter, much worse than expected, as the lockdowns imposed in major cities this year hamstrung the economy. On an annual basis, China’s GDP grew just 0.4%, the slowest since the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, and shy of forecasts of 1.2% growth. The slowdown comes after Shanghai was sealed off for two months as it battled a Covid-19 resurgence, tangling supply chains and forcing factories to halt operations. It means Beijing is likely to miss its goal of 5.5% growth during 2022 -- probably by a wide margin -- another blow to a global economy hit by recession fears. But it could also spur policymakers into fresh stimulus measures to shore up growth, as multiple cities are currently facing some form of restrictions as officials try to stamp out Covid infections. As my colleague Martin Farrer writes, signs have been mounting of a slowdown: This week’s figures showed that imports for the second quarter grew by just 0.1%, called “staggeringly” low by one economist considering that prices for key imported commodities such as oil and food have rocketed since April. The statistics bureau also said on Friday that youth unemployment has risen to 19.3%, a trend accelerated by the full or partial lockdowns imposed in major centres across China in March and April, including the commercial capital, Shanghai. While many of those curbs have since been lifted, and June data offered signs of improvement, analysts do not expect a rapid economic recovery. China is sticking to its tough zero-Covid policy amid fresh flare-ups, the country’s property market is in a deep slump, and the global outlook is darkening. We’ll have more reaction to the China slowdown shortly. Also coming up today UK travellers are facing more disruption this summer, after the RMT union announced last night that drivers at 14 train operating companies are to go on strike on two days next month, bringing many services to a halt. The strike, on 18 and 20 August, is part of an ongoing dispute over jobs, pay and working conditions. A separate UK-wide rail strike is set to take place on 30 July as train drivers across eight companies walk out for 24 hours, the ASLEF union announced yesterday. Pressure is mounting on Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye, after ministers gave him until noon today to provide a plan to resolve the airport’s staffing problems, the Daily Telegraph reported. The move comes aftert Emirates refused its demand to cut flights to help address chaos at the airport. Investors will be watching Italy, where a political crisis is bubbling away. Yesterday Italy’s prime minister Mario Draghi offered his resignation after the 5-Star Movement, a coalition party, failed to back him in a confidence vote -- but the country’s president has rejected it.

Rugged Raasay still feels relatively undiscovered – despite its smart new distillery-with-rooms. Raasay – Gaelic for Isle of the Roe Deer – is 14 miles long by five wide and its landscape of craggy peaks, bosky woodland (a novelty on Scotland’s largely tree-free islands) and secluded bays is pricked with ruined castles and ancient brochs. The restaurant at Raasay House hotel dishes up island venison and Sound of Raasay langoustines. It’s the only hotel on the island, but an interesting alternative is the room above a small art gallery. Tour guide Christa Welser and artist Gordon Cheape visited Raasay a few years ago, fell in love with it and opened a gallery in the hamlet of West Suisnish, with a spectacular view over to Skye. • Sleeps 2, £85 B&amp;B, two-night minimum, raasaygallery.co.uk, available 24-31 July, 11-17 and 25-29 Aug, 1-9 and 15-25 Sept Baleshare Bothies, North Uist, Outer Hebrides On an island off an island in this remote archipelago, these two new glamping pods opened this year: Heisgeir (another name for the nearby, uninhabited, Monach islands) and Hiort, the Gaelic name for the largest island in the St Kilda archipelago. Just a Frisbee’s throw from the shore, with views out over the Atlantic, the simple, purpose-built pods sleep two comfortably or four at a push, are dog-friendly and come with a picnic table and firepit, so after a day’s exploring you can watch the sun sink into the sea with a local sundowner – perhaps a Downpour G&amp;T from artisan North Uist Distillery nearby. Tiny (3.5 square miles), flat and tidal, Baleshare is accessed via a causeway from North Uist. The Outer Hebrides are famous for their spectacular sweeps of powdery white sand – so spectacular, that a beach on Berneray was caught doubling as a tropical island idyll in a Thai holiday brochure back in 2009. And Baleshare has one of the best: on its western shore is an endless stretch of white sand backed with machair (a unique carpet of wildflowers and grasses). Other beachcombing spots include Cula Bay on Benbecula – a haven for wading birds such as oystercatchers, lapwings, snipes and ring plovers – and Balranald, with its RSPB reserve. For traditional live music and good pub grub, the Westford Inn on North Uist does crofters’ platters of smoked fish and cheese, and local langoustines, lemon mayo and chips. • Sleep 2-4, from £90 a night, two-night minimum, coolcamping.com, limited availability until September Timber Cottage, Eilean Shona, Argyll Vanessa Branson’s private island retreat in Loch Moidart off the west coast includes nine cute cottages (three gas-lit and off-grid, all with firepits) and the nine-bedroom house. The latest addition, Timber Cottage, is a bijoux bolthole for two 10 minutes’ walk from the jetty – where guests arrive after a short private boat transfer from the mainland. Inside it’s fresh, bright and light, all whitewashed tongue-and-groove, with a rolltop tub, open fire and splashes of colour from Moroccan textiles and rugs (Vanessa also owns a riad in Marrakech). The two-square-mile island is said to be the inspiration for author JM Barrie’s Neverland and is perfect for feral fun: tramps over the heathery hills, crashing through tangled vegetation, lding campfires, rock-pooling and cooking pans of free mussels. The secluded silvery sand of Shoe Bay is perfect for a picnic – as is a newly revamped picnic bothy. Hiking along the rocky coastline you’re likely to spot seals, sea eagles and otters, and in summer there’s a chance of glimpsing minke whales and basking sharks. • Sleeps 2, £1,100 a week, eileanshona.com, book ahead as availability very limited Mangersta Croft, Uig, Isle of Lewis, Outer Hebrides On the rugged Uig peninsula, on the west coast of Lewis, the northernmost Hebridean island, Mangersta Croft is home to artists Derek Scanlan and Elsie Mitchell, their studio gallery and a clutch of cute glamping options – two jaunty shepherds’ huts, one post-box red, the other mustard with pastel interiors, and two glamping pods, with a stone firepit hunkered into the hill. On the five-hectare (12-acre) working croft they grow crops and veg and have a small herd of aberdeen angus cattle and blackface sheep. On the doorstep are the golden sweep of Mangersta beach and wild clifftops for hiking. Curve round the coast to the Mangersta sea stacks, or dip down to coves to go swimming, surfing and kayaking. Seatrek operates RIB rides and wildlife-watching boat trips (from £32pp) from the jetty at nearby Miavaig on Loch Roag, visiting the seal colonies around Berisay, caves and cliffs with nesting kittiwakes, and looking out for sea eagles and otters foraging on the shoreline. A five-minute drive away, with its picture windows framing Uig Bay, is Uig Sands restaurant, which offers seafood chowder and soda bread, locally smoked salmon with beetroot and ginger relish, and pan-fried Lewis cod with celeriac, roast fennel and a, roast fennel and mussel cream. • Sleeps 2-4, from £95 a night, mangurstadhgallery.com, limited availability in August, more from September onwards Eigg Organics, Eigg, Inner Hebrides To the south of Skye and one of the Hebrides’ Small Isles, Eigg is five miles long by three wide and home to about 100 people. It’s been run by a trust since a community buyout in 1997 and is groundbreakingly green. Eigg Electric supplies the island from the world’s first fully renewably powered electricity grid. To explore, hire a bike or kayak from Eigg Adventures, or just kick back and enjoy low-key island life. There’s a little grocery store and a restaurant with rooms, Lageorna. In the north of the island, Eigg Organics is a working croft run by Sue Holland and Neil Robertson. The croft house is heated by locally grown and processed wood, the water – from a spring – by solar power. They grow their own veg, have hens for eggs and a flock of rare-breed Soay sheep, and offer croft tours and gardening courses. Accommodation is in a Mongolian yurt (sleeps 3) in a wildflower meadow with views over the sea to Rum or the old stone bothy (sleeps 4) – once a cattle shed – with woodburner and compost loo. Or there’s camping in the field. • Yurt from £60 a night, camping £7pp, eiggorganics.co.uk. Bothy available from late September Braelee, Hamnavoe, Burra, Shetland The tiny outhouse is attached to owner Helen’s cottage in the little fishing village of Hamnavoe on the island of Burra, linked to Shetland’s “mainland” by a bridge. She has done it up in quirky contemporary style with a mid-century vibe. Helen is a chef at cafe-bar the Dowry in the capital, Lerwick, a 15-minute drive away. On the menu are small plates of potted Shetland crab, pork crackling, pickled apple and fennel and soda bread, and fish stew with lemongrass, chilli and coconut. Helen is about to start offering breakfast (with eggs from her hens) and dinner at the cottage. Her father’s a fisherman and menus will focus on his catch (lobster, crab and mackerel). Hamnavoe has a pretty harbour and a little shop where you can book a fishing or boat trip with Shetland Sea Adventures – whale-watching on the west coast or excursions to the island of Foula. There are coastal walks from the door – hike up to the lighthouse on Fugla Ness, or take a circular route from the harbour to Sands of Meal – one of Shetland’s most spectacular sweeps of sand. Banna Minn is another and a footpath from here leads to Kettla Ness headland – a birdwatching hotspot. • Sleeps 3, from £65 a night, on Airbnb, smattering of summer availability including late August, more from September Iona Pods, Iona, Inner Hebrides Iona is not off-the-beaten track – pilgrims have beaten a path to its shores for centuries: St Columba founded the abbey here with a handful of followers in AD563 and it has been dubbed the Cradle of Christianity. The Benedictine abbey reopened last month after a £3m restoration. Many who come are struck by the peaceful, almost mystical atmosphere – helped by the fact that visitors can’t bring their cars to the island. The foot ferry from Mull across the Sound of Iona is less than a mile. After the daytrippers leave, the island takes on a different character and it’s worth staying longer to soak up the tranquillity. Iona Pods, a glamping site on a croft that has been in the same family for generations, has 10 cabins with views over the water to Mull and a 10-minute walk to the beach – the island’s beaches are also heavenly. • Sleep 4, from £50 a night (£80 in high season), ionapods.com, little availability until mid-September The Storehouse, Kirkwall, Orkney Heritage and history seep into every aspect of an Orcadian itinerary, the archipelago off Scotland’s north-east coast, with its 5,000-year-old Neolithic world heritage sites, including Skara Brae. Orcadian knitwear designer Judith Glue and her husband, David Spence, restored the Storehouse, a 19th-century building that was once a pork and herring curing station, then a printworks, converting it into a smart restaurant with rooms in 2018. Much of the original wood and stone was rescued and reused and the huge wooden beams in the bar and first-floor bedrooms were salvaged from ship wrecks. In the restaurant, chef Gayle Grieve dishes up local specialities such as hand-dived scallops – caught by her husband, Emlyn. There are eight rooms, each with a nod to the islands’ heritage and colour palette, such as Silver Darlings (an old nickname for herring) and earthy-hued Maeshowe, named after one of the Neolithic tombs and incorporating original wooden shutters and flagstone sills. • Doubles from £130 B&amp;B, two-night minimum, thestorehouserestaurantwithrooms.co.uk, good summer availability Hame Hotel, Dunvegan, Skye Even on Skye – where in the summer of 2017 visitors were begged not to turn up without accommodation as the island was “full” – there are some off-the-beaten-track hideaways. Hame Hotel, in the north-west, looks out over Loch Vattan towards the brooding Black Cuillins and is a few miles from Dunvegan Castle. Flora and Mungo Laing moved from London in 2018 to set it up after Calum MacKinnon, one of the brains behind Mac &amp; Wild restaurants, stumbled on what he thought was the perfect spot for a new venture. The couple renovated the property, turning it into an eight-room hotel in a mix of pared-back Scandi and Scottish design. Think: grey wool sofas, rugs and cushions from modern Scottish brand Anta, and artworks by Alasdair Hillery (Flora’s dad) and Jane Laing (Mungo’s mother). In the dining room, all pale wood and picture windows, guests tuck into breakfasts of homemade granola and fresh fruit, porridge and poached eggs with coffee from local roaster Caora Dhubh, and dinners of local venison, the neighbour’s beef and lamb and fresh-off-the-boat shellfish. They also organise regular retreats, from wild food foraging to yoga and painting workshops. • Doubles from £180 B&amp;B, hamehotel.com, book ahead as availability very limited Teacher’s Bothy, Isle of Gometra, Inner Hebrides It’s no walk in the park getting to this tiny, whitewashed bothy, an off-grid hideaway for two on the small private island of Gometra, owned by environmental activist Roc Sandford, who also lives off-grid here for most of the year. After catching the ferry from Mull to the isle of Ulva, it’s an eight-mile hike in from the nearest road (Gometra is connected by a bridge – and by the beach at low tide – to Ulva). Kayakers are welcome as are “island baggers” and hill walkers. The bothy is basic. There’s usually cold running water, which can be heated if you bring fuel for the stove, and there’s an extensive list of what you will not find. There’s no electricity, telephone or doctor on the island. You need to bring your own food, bedding, a torch, supplies – and a spirit of adventure. But after lighting the fire, having a long soak in a hot bath by candlelight while listening to waves crashing outside the door, it’s easy to see the appeal. • Sleeps 2, £48 a night, on Airbnb, book ahead as availability very limited"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/mar/28/australia-politics-live-labor-anthony-albanese-housing-future-fund-senate-greens-pocock-nsw-election-minority-chris-minns-climate-gas-bandt-bowen-safeguard","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-28T07:51:40Z","webTitle":"National reconstruction fund secures crossbench support – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/28/australia-politics-live-labor-anthony-albanese-housing-future-fund-senate-greens-pocock-nsw-election-minority-chris-minns-climate-gas-bandt-bowen-safeguard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/28/australia-politics-live-labor-anthony-albanese-housing-future-fund-senate-greens-pocock-nsw-election-minority-chris-minns-climate-gas-bandt-bowen-safeguard","fields":{"headline":"National reconstruction fund secures crossbench support – as it happened","bodyText":"And that wraps our news for this evening. Here is what hit the headlines today: David Pocock announced he would be voting for the safeguard mechanism, making up the last vote the government needs for the legislation to pass the Senate. Electricity giant Origin Energy was taken over by Brookfield and MidOcean in an $18bn-plus bid. The deal means AGL Energy will be Australia’s only publicly listed energy player of any size. NSW Labor’s leader Chris Minns was sworn in as the 47th premier of New South Wales. The federal industry minister, Ed Husic, secured necessary cross-bench support for the national reconstruction fund, meaning the bill is set to pass the Senate. Labor MP Josh Burns said the recent questioning of the Indigenous voice to parliament’s scope is an attempt by the opposition to “muddy the waters”. And the government’s planned reforms to whistleblower protections have been delayed. ACT Independent Senator David Pocock has confirmed support for the government’s National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Bill 2023, following an agreement today with industry and science minister Ed Husic. Critical to the success of the NRF is ensuring there’s a sustainable pipeline of eligible projects at a stage suitable for funding through the corporation. This is especially important for Canberra’s burgeoning startup sector and I welcome the government’s commitment to exploring additional policy mechanisms that would provide Australian startups access to finance as they navigate the path to commercialisation. This commitment will help address one of the biggest challenges local firms raise with me around the need for more of that early capital to get them through the valley of death. The bill is set to pass senate, after Labor met Greens demand for a ban on reconstruction fund investment in coal, gas and native logging earlier this month. Chinese broadcaster shows interview with Daniel Andrews from 2017 The Victorian premier’s office has confirmed that an interview with Daniel Andrews published by a Chinese broadcaster to coincide with his trip to Beijing was filmed in 2017. Phoenix TV - a Hong-Kong based state-owned broadcaster - published an interview with Andrews on Tuesday afternoon where the premier said he could not imagine the state “without the Chinese influence”. The exact date of publication was unclear. Andrews’ four-day trip to China - that began on Tuesday - has sparked criticism over the exclusion of Australian journalists and the limited itinerary detail. A spokesperson for Andrews on Tuesday night said the video was filmed on 8 February 2017. Flexibility in transport gig work a ‘myth’, says Transport Worker’s Union Almost half of the gig workers employed in the transport and meal delivery industry earn less than the minimum wage, and 81% depend on gig economy income to survive, according to a report released by the Transport Workers Union, TEACHO, and the McKell Institute. The report surveyed 1,000 food delivery, rideshare and Amazon Flex drivers. It comes as the government pledges to reform gig worker’s conditions and pay in the second half of this year. The study found 42% of those surveyed work over 40 hours a week, while 69% said they have to work peak hours to earn enough money. 56% of food delivery riders reported feeling pressure to rush and take risks on the road to earn enough money and avoid deactivation for being deemed too slow. The Transport Union’s national secretary, Michael Kaine, said: This alarming study busts the myth that transport gig work currently offers flexibility in anything but a tagline. Although many food delivery, parcel delivery and rideshare drivers are drawn to this work on the promise of flexible hours, this is unobtainable without the existence of fair, safe and sustainable standards. ABC news director admits diversity shortcomings The ABC’s news director, Justin Stevens, admits the broadcaster has “a way to go” in achieving diversity after the host of Q+A Stan Grant criticised the “entire white panel” on the ABC’s New South Wales election panel. In a letter to ABC managing director David Anderson, which was leaked in part to Crikey, Grant said: In 2023, how is it at all acceptable that an election night coverage features an entire white panel. This is not a criticism of my colleagues who are all well qualified, but it is a criticism of the ABC that for decades has nurtured and promoted white staff at the exclusion of others. There is no excuse for what I saw on air last night. None. I have worked at organisations around the world and nowhere would what we presented last night be tolerated. Read the full story by Amanda Meade here: Meat industry’s response to shocking footage ‘unbelievable’, activist says The activist who obtained shocking footage showing pigs screaming, writhing and frothing at the mouth as they were gassed before slaughter has condemned the industry’s response to the footage. The ABC published footage on Monday night raising questions about the impact of carbon dioxide gassing, a supposedly safer method of stunning animals prior to slaughter. The footage was obtained by Chris Delforce, from the Farm Transparency Project. On Tuesday the Australian Meat Industry Council (AMIC) responded forcefully to the footage, telling the ABC it “didn’t see any mistreatment of any animals”. Delforce said he could not believe the industry’s response: It’s unbelievable that anyone can watch such obvious horrific cruelty and claim with a straight face that they ‘didn’t see any mistreatment of animals’. AMIC also claimed to the ABC that Delforce had only used footage that was “actually repeated on a loop”. AMIC suggested that Delforce had found specific pigs that reacted badly to the gas as opposed to “showing us the total process”. In fact, the Farm Transparency Project has published hours of footage captured over an extended period, depicting multiple stages of the process. Delforce said: The claim that ‘the footage that was utilised was actually repeated on a loop’ is utterly ridiculous and easily disprovable by the hours of footage we’ve made available on our website. The ABC should be ashamed for publishing such nonsense. Australian party MP Bob Katter was on ABC Afternoon Briefing earlier saying the safeguard mechanism will condemn mine workers to “grinding poverty”. Both parties now are committed to the abolition of the coal industry by 2030. Now, there is 200,000 Australians employed in that industry. 200,000 jobs … Where are they going to go? There is no second industry to pick them up. Cattle numbers are down 23%, the cane industry is down 15%, the dairy industry is down 23%, so don’t go to agriculture. Where are they going to go? You are going to take their jobs away and condemn them to a grinding poverty. That is what you are doing. National reconstruction fund gets crossbench support You can add Ed Husic to the list of ministers who have had a win this week – the industry minister has announced he has secured the necessary cross bench support for the national reconstruction fund. That leaves Julie Collins’ housing future fund as the only hallmark bill yet to get the support – that won’t be dealt with now until after the budget in the first week of May The government’s planned reforms to whistleblower protections have been delayed. The government had planned to debate the changes to the Public Interest Disclosure (PID) Act in the Senate this week. But the packed legislative agenda in the upper house which includes debate of Labor’s signature climate policy, has forced the PID act reforms off the agenda. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has previously committed to implementing the reforms prior to the federal integrity commission commencing operations, which is expected in July. GetUp’s chief campaigns officer, Roj Amedi, said the longer the government refuses to act, the more whistleblowers and others who speak up will suffer. The attorney general has claimed that he is a champion for whistleblowers, but he has yet to walk the talk. Not only is Labor failing to treat these piecemeal but important reforms as a priority, they’re refusing to intervene in the ongoing prosecution of two brave whistleblowers – Richard Boyle and David McBride. Climate models still pointing to an El Niño later in the year Every two weeks, the Bureau of Meteorology updates its climate drivers forecast. A fortnight ago, they created a bit of a surprise by switching from a La Niña watch to an El Niño watch in a single leap. As a “watch”, it means there’s about a 50% chance of an El Niño forming in the Pacific later this year. All the major climate models point in that direction (particularly the bureau’s own one). Meteorologists will be quick to emphasise that at this time of the year, model accuracy is on the low side. (There’s a predictability barrier to clear, every autumn, when the Pacific seems to do a big reset.) Still, it’s a shift in conditions that would probably have a big impact globally if it happens, hence the value in tracking each update. During El Niño years, the usual easterly blowing equatorial winds of the central Pacific stall and even reverse. Rainfall patterns typically shift eastwards away from eastern Australia. Some of us might want a change from the wet La Niña years (when rainfall shifts westwards to Australia). The prospect, though, of drier conditions and more intense heatwaves than we’ve seen in the past couple of years won’t be so welcome if they eventuate. The buildup of vegetation in many regions could elevate the bushfire risks, for one thing. The teal crossbench MP for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, is calling for broad tax reform, hosting a tax round table on Friday. She tells ABC Afternoon Briefing that tax policy has been an area major parties “have been scared to engage” with. Spender’s round table will bring together tax experts, community and business voices, to try “to open the space up”. I think the tax system is in a perilous state and it is time to really face this from the front. I’m seeking to … make sure that we have sustainable, fair and efficient tax system but that also drives productivity and wages growth. We have slow productivity that is absolutely partly driven by tax. I think on the corporate sphere, we have high corporate tax, and that I know is a concern for the business community over time. I supported a carbon price. Sometimes they are unpopular, but at the same time it will be cheaper if we had a carbon price now than if we have a series of different activities trying to reduce emissions. I think we should have these questions on the table. Labor MP says Liberals ‘trying to play tricky political games’ on the voice On the scope of the voice to parliament, the Labor MP Josh Burns confirms to ABC Afternoon Briefing that any decision on policy is sill a “sovereign matter for the parliament”. The voice will make recommendations on matters that are important and impacts the lives of Indigenous people. That’s how it was designed and what the Uluru statement from the heart asked for. The other point to make is the voice can make representation, and that is what First Nations people asking for … They are also asking for recognition in our constitution but also asking to be consulted. Ultimately any decision on any policy matter is still a sovereign matter for the parliament and that is part of the very specific words that were released last week by the attorney general, and I think that the opposition know all of this and they’re trying to play tricky political games. The Labor MP for Macnamara, Josh Burns, tells ABC Afternoon Briefing that recent questioning of the scope of the Indigenous voice to parliament is an attempt by the opposition to “muddy the waters”. They are just grasping in any institution they can to muddy the waters. Why are they doing that? Because the leader of the opposition doesn’t support the voice and he is trying to play a whole range of tactical games and that is his prerogative. Adviser to Ukraine’s defence minister seeks Australian help on weapons Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine’s defence minister, is visiting Canberra today. He tells ABC Afternoon Briefing it is important to “maintain this connection between our nations” and to ensure Australia continues to stand with Ukraine as it enters its second year of war with Russia. We are currently preparing for our counteroffensive because our military objective number one remains incomplete. Liberation of our lands, pushing away the enemy and then eventually bringing them to account and justice through the international war crimes tribunal. We need weapons that can help us efficiently protect our skies and can help our ground forces conduct counteroffensive operations … Australia could be a leader in showing the world that Ukraine will get even the most modern weapons to defeat the enemy. Sak says Ukraine welcomes Australia to join the “international tank coalition”, after a delegation last week requested Australian-owned Abrams tanks. He is the second high-profile visitor from Ukraine this week. Origin’s new owners ‘haven’t contemplated’ sale of Eraring back to NSW As mentioned in an earlier post, the $18.7bn takeover of Origin Energy by Brookfield and MidOcean placed a bit of a question mark over the future of the energy company’s (and Australia’s) biggest power plant, Eraring, in New South Wales. We noted that Brookfield and MidOcean’s media release didn’t repeat the 2025 date for Eraring that Origin had previously stated. So we asked them to clarify. A spokesperson for Brookfield told Guardian Australia: The earliest possible closure date for Eraring is August 2025. We have always said we won’t take capacity out of the system until replacement is online. During the recent NSW election, Labor in particular left open the possibility of buying back Eraring if needed. (Or, at least, didn’t rule it out.) The Coalition vacillated but the now former premier Dom Perrottet indicated a buyback could be considered if needed. Anyway, Brookfield’s spokesperson doesn’t seem keen to ventilate the idea. “We haven’t contemplated a sell-back,” she said. “We wouldn’t sell Eraring if it meant keeping it open longer than it needs to be.” In its statement, Brookfield played up the closure of Eraring as being key to cutting the business’s absolute carbon emissions by more than 70% by 2030 (presumably, compared with now). One thing to keep in mind is that Origin has stated it costs $200m-$250m a year in operating and capital spending to keep the plant running now. That’s before paying for the coal. There’s a fair chance that sum isn’t going to decline in coming years. Still, a lot can happen between now and 2025. As we noted in this pre-election piece, NSW’s electricity grid has its share of challenges ahead: About 1,200 megawatts of generation capacity will drop off the grid by 29 April, with the closure of AGL’s Liddell power plant in NSW’s Hunter Valley. Those power issues are also topical given the ACTU president, Michele O’Neil, was just talking to the National Press Club about the need for a National Energy Transition Authority to deal with the shift away from fossil fuels. On that note, I will hand over to the lovely Rafqa Touma to take you through the evening, while I go and stare at a wall. Make sure you check in for what Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst have been working on, as well as the rest of the Guardian brains trust. It is somehow only Tuesday, which means we have two more days of parliament – I will be back with you early tomorrow morning, but until then, please – take care of you. Greens want housing fund to include help for renters On Afternoon Briefing, Sarah Hanson-Young explains why the housing fund isn’t on that extended list – because the Greens aren’t budging unless something is done for renters. We just agreed in the Senate to how the rest of the week is going to unfold. It means that we will get through the safeguard mechanism legislation by Thursday afternoon. The housing bill that the government had wanted to bring on won’t be dealt with in the Senate this week. We are still in negotiations with the government on this, so they don’t have the numbers. They don’t have the ability to [push it] through. We will keep talking to them – we really want them to act on the fact that one-third of Australians live in rentals and rental properties, and they get nothing out of what the government has put on the table. We want to push the government on making sure that [renters are helped] to deal with soaring rents, [and those in] unfair arrangements actually get a fairer deal. As Paul Karp previewed earlier today, the Senate is down for a long night. But what is not on there? The housing fund. Hastie ‘disheartened’ by ACTU’s anti-nuclear stance which extends to nuclear subs The shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, is not pleased with the ACTU for its longstanding stance against nuclear, which extends to the nuclear submarines. Hastie is “disheartened” by the union stance. The Coalition has been bipartisan on Aukus because we know that it is a multigenerational, nation-building project that demands support from governments around the nation, industry and the private sector. Most importantly, it needs the support of the Australian people. For Labor and its industrial wing to be divided on nuclear submarines sends a confusing signal to the Australian people. It’s particularly damaging when the government has clearly articulated our strategic need for submarines and has promised the creation of 20,000 local jobs. The opposition hopes that the ACTU can reflect on its ‘longstanding position’ and adapt, as our strategic circumstances now demand. Indeed, it’s time to be progressive and not reactionary. The ACTU should drop its archaic last-century stance on nuclear power, and work on growing Australian industry in the national interest. We call on the Albanese government to exercise leadership in bringing together its union wing in the national interest. We in opposition are playing our part. We hope the Albanese government can play theirs. From Mike Bowers’ lens to your eyeballs. See if you can guess today’s question time theme: Australian National University won’t adopt controversial antisemitism definition The Australian National University has rejected growing pressure from parliamentary MPs to adopt a controversial definition of antisemitism. The International Holocaust Remembrance Association (IHRA) definition of antisemitism has been critiqued as an “outright attack on academic freedom” among Palestinian and Arab scholars who argue its definition of antisemitism, which includes “targeting the state of Israel”, could be used to shut down legitimate criticism of Israel. It follows an open letter from the Parliamentary Friends of IHRA sent to vice-chancellors in November, urging them to formally adopt the IHRA definition and requesting a response by the end of January. The group is headed by MPs Josh Burns, Allegra Spender and Julian Leeser. The ANU vice-chancellor, Prof Brian Schmidt, confirmed on Tuesday the university does not intend to adopt the working definition after its Academic Freedom Reference Group found ANU’s “current system of policies and procedures, as well as the university’s culture, practice and values adequately addresses the threat of antisemitism”. The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) and the Australian National University Students’ Association (ANUSA) welcomed the move. In a joint statement this afternoon, the bodies said staff and students had expressed “serious concern” about the proposed adoption. These concerns include the potential for this working definition to be misused to suppress research and teaching activities critical of the actions of the state of Israel. Concerns have also been raised that the working definition has a chilling effect on academic freedom, including the freedom of staff and students to engage in discourse on political and human rights issues. The NTEU and ANUSA … have made representations to the ANU over the past three months urging the university not to adopt the IHRA working definition … we believe this provides a strong example for other universities in the sector who may still be considering the IHRA working definition. This is also an opportune time for reconsideration for other universities who have already adopted the working definition. The University of Melbourne was the first tertiary institution to publicly back the definition as part of its antiracism strategy this year, while Monash University, Macquarie University, Sunshine Coast University and the University of Wollongong have also changed their policies to include the IHRA statement. Labor to introduce bill to help protect migrant workers’ entitlements Tony Burke plans on introducing the “protecting worker entitlements bill”, which will make clear that workplace protections apply to migrant workers on temporary visas. As a result of this change, visa workers will be left in no doubt they have the same rights and protections as other Australians. This is an important step in reducing the opportunity for these workers to be exploited. Temporary visa workers may have poor knowledge of their workplace rights or may be fearful about seeking help about pay and conditions and enterprise agreements, superannuation and workplace safety. Too often, these vulnerabilities are exploited by unscrupulous employers. The changes will mean visa holders who may have been exploited or underpaid will know they have the same access to remedies as other workers. Question time ends There are two more to go before this sitting rises and the parliament won’t return until May, when the budget is handed down. Which also means there are two more question times before the Aston byelection. Will that change anything? Possibly not – Peter Dutton might pop his head up a little more and the Coalition may stop asking the same two questions in different ways, but other than that, we are probably stuck here for quite some time. PM reiterates again the primacy of the parliament in voice plans Paul Fletcher tries again: Prime minister, will the voice need to be consulted on defence and foreign affairs matters? Anthony Albanese seems quite fed up. Someone remind him he has the power to stop question time at any moment he chooses. Albanese: The question that will be asked is a proposed law to alter the constitution to recognise the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice. Do you approve this proposed alteration? That’s the question. The proposed change in the constitution is the first bit, is the recognition – in recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Peoples of Australia. One, there shall be a body to be called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice. Two, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice may make representations to the parliament and the executive government – the same words used by the shadow attorney general in his submission way back in 2014 – of the commonwealth on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. That’s there. The third clause gives primacy to this parliament for what will be considered. For what will be considered. This goes to what will be considered by the voice. The parliament shall, subject to this constitution, have power to make laws with respect to matters relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice, including its composition, functions, powers and procedures. This is an assertion ... of the primacy of the parliament for what the voice will consider. That is why it is consistent with the views put forward by constitutional conservatives. This is a conservative, modest proposal that has been made even tighter as a result of the additional words that were added between the Garma speech and last Thursday and in the legislation that will be introduced. The two key words there are “matters” and then “including” – including, including. So the primacy of the parliament is made very clear by those words. Which is what the former chief justice [French] has agreed, what Anne Twomey has agreed and what the shadow attorney general knows full well as well, because it’s consistent with what he has been saying for years. For years. David Pocock on the ‘we’re about to run out of gas’ arguments: PM calls opposition attempts to undermine the voice ‘so sad’ My question is to the prime minister on concerns on the voice. Can he confirm the voice is not about defence policy or foreign affairs policy? (There are heckles of “monorail, monorail, monoraillllllll” as Fletcher sits down, which is part of an ongoing joke some Labor MPs have about Fletcher looking like Lyle Lanley from the Simpsons. No, this is not a place for grownups.) Anthony Albanese: They should know what the voice is about because for 10 years they were actually the government that established the committees and established the processes and produced the reports that dealt with the voice department. That dealt with it. Indeed the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs proudly said in his first speech to parliament, an important public debate in time of increasing polarisation of years, we need people who can build consensus and find middle ground. In more recent times I have worked with Indigenous leaders and constitutional conservatives to find a constitutional way to make better policy about and give due recognition of Indigenous Australians while avoiding the downsides of inserting symbolic language into attending document. Fletcher has a point of order which is not a point of order. Albanese: I’m surprised that quoting the member for Berowra’s first speech is something controversial in this place. But it was about the voice, his first speech, and he deserves credit for the work that he has done on the voice. Which is why it is so sad that what we see now is an attempt ongoing to raise issues in a way that are designed to undermine the opportunity that Australians have ... to unite the country in a positive way just like I offered to the former prime minister when we met in his office on the first sitting day of parliament in 2019. Because, bear this in mind, those opposite prior to the election made a commitment to advance the voice to parliament. And Ken Wyatt to his credit was appointed as the first ever Aboriginal to hold the position of minister for Indigenous Australians. And I appointed the shadow minister, and that was to advance … Peter Dutton has a point of order, but Milton Dick asks Albanese if he has concluded his answer. “No,” Albanese says. “Have you started,” Dutton quips and the Coalition falls into laughter and cheers because the bar is subterranean in this place. We’re about to hit the Earth’s core it’s so low. ‘You cannot fund half a road’: PM on the high cost of regional road link The independent MP for Calare, Andrew Gee (who left the Nationals after the party room resolved not to support the Indigenous voice to parliament), asks about a road link between Orange and Mudgee which communities have waited generations for. Anthony Albanese: I know that he is very passionate about this project to provide a road link between Orange and Mudgee, it is a complex proposal because it does of course involve a river crossing and therefore the cost has been assessed and unfortunately it has been much higher than $27.8m. Like many of the commitments that were made opposite, essentially you cannot fund half a road, you cannot just have one side, you can’t have it go half the way. You need to have the entire funding there, which is why I have looked forward to and I have raised the issue with my minister for infrastructure and transport as to whether there would be an interest as well in the New South Wales government, the incoming NSW government, also being engaged with this project, or indeed with the shire councils in that area. I will certainly come back to the member for talks about this. We have allocated some $23bn to NSW … And, as the member knows, because I travelled with him to call there during the natural disasters which tragically a lot of his electorate was impacted by, we continue to invest where it is needed to deal with the natural disasters that had such a devastating impact, in particular the floods, in his community. I look forward to working with the member and thank him for the question. Leeser asks PM what policy areas will be excluded from the voice’s remit The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, has another question on the voice: In the prime minister’s press conference yesterday, in response to a question about the scope and the voice’s powers, the prime minister said, and I quote, the voice is not about defence policy, it’s not about foreign affairs. What other matters are excluded from the remit of the voice? Leeser asked a very similar question in QT to the one a journalist for the Australian asked in a press conference yesterday. The PM shot both questions down pretty quickly. Anthony Albanese: Well, a colleague once wrote about what the voice was about and he said this, they proposed a consolidated body that merely provides advice. It cannot [influence] federal parliament, it rather provides greater input into the policy-making process, which should lead to policy improvements and greater [involvement] by and from Indigenous people across Australia. It is important that if the parliament is going to make laws about Indigenous people, Indigenous people should be consulted about those laws. There is nothing … about articulation of that rule in the constitution, the constitution rules for parliament are set out. In my view, the proposal for an advisory body has real merit and [fits] comfortably with the nature of the constitution … It was indeed very wise words from member from Berowra in 2016. The member for Berowra knows ... There are a bunch of interjections. Paul Karp hears Peter Dutton ask “are you capable of answering a question” to Albanese while holding a finger up, “just one … cannot answer a question”. Milton Dick tries to quiet everyone down. Albanese continues with what he said earlier – the voice provides advice on issues and policies which have direct impact on Indigenous Australians. Tanya Plibersek is answering a question on water and dams from Bob Katter when Sussan Ley gets to her feet with a point of order. The prime minster apparently left the chamber for a moment or wasn’t in his seat. It has massive “didn’t get voted prefect and am making it everyone’s problem” vibes, but that covers most of the parliament. (Speaker Milton Dick rules it is not a point of order and then has to put his headmaster voice on to chastise using points of order that way.) Bill Shorten talks about another of the zombie measures (unfunded projects/policies in the budget, or projects/policies which are meant to go on but the funding ends at the financial year) and the Liberal MP Tony Pasin yells loud enough for my colleague Paul Karp to hear: Stop picking on Jimmy. Oh Jimmy’s cooking the books. “Jimmy” being a reference to the treasurer, Jim Chalmers. He is implying the funding cliffs are Labor’s fault because they didn’t address it in the October budget. Good times. PM hits back at Coalition for not engaging on emissions policy The opposition still seems very annoyed at the outcome of a piece of legislation it refused to engage on. Zoe McKenzie, the Liberal MP for Flinders, asks: The government’s deal with the Greens on emissions will force up our prices and further risk domestic gas supply. This comes after the Australian Energy Market Operator is warning of gas shortages in Victoria. Can the prime minister guarantee there will be no disruption to gas supply to Victorians this winter? Anthony Albanese: Only a party addicted to secrecy and cover-ups and denial would say that there is a bad thing that this parliament is prepared to work with colleagues across the parliament to achieve reform and change. We make no apologies for engaging across this parliament. It is just a pity that those opposite are now the observers rather than the participants in this parliament. They chose to be nowhere near any of this. And it is no wonder that the member for Bass had this to say: ‘I am utterly exacerbated by the lack of engagement from my own side to come to the table and engage in a constructive conversation.’ I’m asked about arrangements in this parliament in order to achieve the legislation that is through. And what we had from those opposite is ongoing scare campaigns. They said, remember when we met in December, they said this: ‘Labor’s diabolical plan,’ the member for Hume said, ‘will undermine investment in Australia.’ The leader of the opposition said it would tear away at investment confidence. The leader of the opposition said it would disrupt investment into our country. Have a look at what has happened today. On investment … Paul Fletcher has a point of order that the prime minister isn’t addressing the question on gas supply. My colleague Paul Karp hears Albanese say: ‘It wasn’t a straight question. Read the whole thing.’ Which is what the speaker, Milton Dick, ends up ruling, telling Fletcher he can’t use a point of order on relevance to pick out a part of the question he wants answered. Albanese continues to talk about investment and companies which have reacted positively, and finishes with: No wonder they are against solar power because they keep predicting the sky will fall in. That is why they are against solar power. Because they keep predicting that the sky will fall. Meanwhile, Labor heckles David Littleproud to “ask Senex”, which is in reference to this. Everyone loves the Olympics. (Except the people who may lose their school and park to the expansion of the Gabba, but that is not part of this dixer answer from Catherine King.) Instead, King talks about the former government not having committed anything to the Olympics in the last budget. Coalition asks minister about ‘delays’ in local government funding Jim Chalmers takes up the time it takes for my instant noodles to heat up to talk about budget “booby traps”. We move on to the LNP MP Llew O’Brien (it’s been a little bit since the member for Wide Bay got a question), who asks local government minister, Kristy McBain: I refer the minister to her failure last week in parliament to address regional program delays for local councils. Given it has been 10 months since the federal election and five months since the budget, when will councils receive guidelines for the local roads and community infrastructure program so they can plan for critical road upgrades? This is the third time a version of this question has been asked. McBain: It’s so great to see members of the LNP on the road to Damascus about guidelines. It wasn’t a big priority for them previously. But it is great to see that they are interested in guidelines now. Five months ago we announced our budget, local roads and community infrastructure is a huge part of that budget. We know how important it is to local councils. It’s an untied grant fund that allows them to deal with community priorities. What we’re doing on this side of the house is engaging directly with local councils, directly with local government organisations and associations for the first time ever, we are talking directly with them about the things that matter most to them. Consulting with our trusted delivery partners in local councils. David Littleproud has thoughts on relevance, but the speaker, Milton Dick, says it is all very relevant, as McBain is talking about the program they asked about. McBain finishes with pretty much the same thing the last two times this question was raised covered – consultation is under way. Ley asks PM if legal advice on the voice will be released Sussan Ley gets the constitutional Indigenous voice to parliament question today: Every single person into this country wants to see better outcomes for Indigenous Australians. There is no moral high ground and no monopoly on good intentions. Australians have made it clear over many decades that there are no blank takes on constitutional reform. Will the prime minister release all advice from the solicitor general and any other legal advisers on the voice so that Australians can fully understand all of the implications of the proposed change? Anthony Albanese: I certainly agree with the statement that Australians want to close the gap and Australians want reconciliation to be advanced. I am asked about legal opinion. The government’s position is the same as the former government, but there is a range of legal opinion, legal opinion has put forward and words have been put forward and I want to make this point. … I want to go to where these words have come from that will be put to the Australian people because [there was a proposal developed in 2013], see if it sounds familiar, proposing a new chapter of the constitution. It said these: “There shall be an Aboriginal and Torres Strait underbody to be called [insert the appropriate name] which shall have the function of providing advice to the parliament and the executive government on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.” It went on to state the parliament will have power to make laws with respect to the composition, roles, powers and position of the body. They were the two key clauses put forward in 2014. One of the authors is the shadow attorney general, who is a part of that body put forward in 2014. He is a lawyer, he is a lawyer, and the fact is that lawyers, including the member, the member for Berowra and the shadow attorney general, in this country have put forward … Ley tries to bring it back to a point of order on relevance, but because the question said legal advice, Albanese can talk about the constitutional lawyers who have defended the question and the house moves on. Independent MP asks minster about parenting payment boost The North Sydney independent Kylea Tink has a question for Amanda Rishworth: A single parent with two children loses over $100 a week in payments when they’re eight and is forced off the single parent payment on to another which is of lesser value. The government is forcing people to live in poverty or violence. Will the government commit to restoring access to the parenting payment until the child is 16? Rishworth uses a lot of words to say ‘no’. I would like to thank the member for her question and say that the Albanese government is very much committed to supporting single parents to help them manage work and family responsibilities and of course this includes through a range of social security payments, paid parental leave and cheaper childcare. Of course, we know that Australians are doing it tough and we’re always looking at ways we can better support them and that is why we have made a number of commitments to help with the cost of living, cheaper childcare, we have cut the cost of the PBS co-payment and announced the energy bill relief fund, which will deliver targeted and temporary relief from power bills for eligible households including those on income support payments. Of course, for the social security system, single parents can be eligible for parenting payments and as the member rightly indicated, as their child gets older, most parents are able to increase the level of employment and reduce the need for income support. Of course, there are still those that continue to rely on income support as their child gets older and do move to the jobseeker payment and receive a higher rate as the principal carer to ensure they do get additional support. Single parents also can get a range of extra supplements and supports. I would say to the member, of course, this government is always looking at how we can better support Australians, particularly those on lower incomes, and of course the government recently established the economic inclusion advisory committee to provide advice ahead of every federal budget on the economic inclusion and tackling disadvantage, and of course some of the payments that will be looked at include those being received by single parents, such as parenting payments and jobseeker payment as well as commonwealth rent assistance. I do not understand why those opposite are interjecting, but I can tell you that this government will take those most vulnerable seriously. We will consider it through the budget context and look forward to continuing to work with the member to deliver to those most disadvantaged in Australia. Collins uses dixer to call on MPs to pass the housing fund Julie Collins takes a dixer on the housing fund so she can read out what should be a press release titled: PLEASE PASS THE HOUSING FUND. But I don’t think it will move any of the votes the government needs – because the main sticking point isn’t that it is needed, it’s that it is needed SO BADLY and the government policy won’t do enough to change things. PM urges Coalition to back housing future fund Angus Taylor asks about mortgages and Australians struggling to make ends meet and Anthony Albanese talks about the housing future fund, instead of the audacity, so we are all reaching new heights. Albanese: I’m asked about housing. And the cost of housing. And I say to the member who asked the question that he does have an opportunity to do something on housing. Which is to support the Housing Australia Future Fund. That is before this parliament now. Because what the Housing Australia Future Fund along with the housing accord and along with other measures is aimed at doing, of course, is increasing supply of housing that has an impact on price. Economics 101. It has an impact. Victorian premier to meet China’s education minister on first day of trip The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is due to meet with China’s minister of education on the first day of his trip to the state’s biggest trading partner. Andrews’ trip has sparked backlash for the exclusion of Australian media and the lack of specific detail about who he would meet. The premier said his trip would focus on boosting the number of Chinese students studying in the state. The premier’s private office provided a brief update on Tuesday afternoon detailing a list of people Andrews will meet on his first day: Mr Brett Stevens, commissioner for Victoria to Greater China Mr Graham Fletcher, Australian ambassador to China Mr Li Xukui, vice-president, Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries His Excellency Mr Huai Jinpeng, minister of education Dr Yin Yong, mayor of Beijing Peter Dutton has decided to ask some questions today (I told you – we are just SO lucky), so he opens up proceedings with: Why did the prime minister repeatedly promise to cut power bills before the election but has never mentioned that promise since the election? Since the prime minister is the one who stated: “If you make a promise and a commitment, you do have to stick to it.” Did you say one thing before the election and another after it? How can Australians be expected to believe anything [this prime minister says] (it ends with a line about Australians paying the consequences of the cost living crisis). Anthony Albanese gives the same answer he has given since becoming prime minister, with a little dig at Dutton for getting off the bench. (Ukraine, supply chain, global inflation for those playing at home.) Dutton tries to act very serious with a point of order, but it is not a point of order and Albanese continues to act out his one-man play, ‘one man, 5,678 answers’. Coalition will engage with voice process, but still has no position On the voice to parliament, Peter Dutton said the Liberals would engage with the coming committee process, once the constitution alteration bill is introduced this Thursday. The Liberals still don’t have a position on the voice and it’s expected that will remain in limbo until later in the committee process. Anthony Albanese yesterday rebuffed several questions at a press conference about the voice’s powers and whether he should heed Dutton’s request to release legal advice from the solicitor general, calling one question “very strange”. Dutton claimed Albanese was showing “indignance” in answering questions on the voice, noting that many voters still had questions about the referendum and calling the PM’s stance “confounding”. He also noted the furore over allegations that the Labor MP Sam Rae had said an offensive phrase to the Coalition MP Angie Bell yesterday. (Bell says she didn’t hear it, Rae says he didn’t say what was attributed to him, and the only verified allegation comes from Liberal MP Tony Pasin who says he heard something that can’t be picked up on footage from the chamber.) Dutton called the alleged words “disgraceful” and claimed Rae “didn’t have the guts to apologise” properly to Bell (Rae did apologise for the interjection but claims he didn’t say the alleged words). Other Coalition MPs later criticised Rae, and claimed it was the latest in a string of bad behaviour from Labor MPs to conservative female pollies. One MP suggested that anyone hearing an alleged bad taste remark should stand up and flag it immediately. Dutton’s warning for federal party room over Deeming fallout The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has warned his party room about the fallout from the Victorian Liberals’ issues with Moira Deeming, saying “damage” can be caused if politicians focus on themselves. Dutton also criticised what he called “indignance” from the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, in response to recent questions about the Indigenous voice. At the Coalition party room meeting in Canberra today, Dutton admitted the NSW election result (where Labor won power after 12 years) was “disappointing” for his party. The opposition leader noted that there would be more soul-searching from the Coalition, after another election loss, but that a lot of the commentary about the future path of the party would be “self-serving”. Dutton noted that some people would say the party needs to go further right, while others would call for a more centrist approach. With Dutton seeking to win office at the next federal election (due by 2025) against the backdrop of a mainland wall of Labor red, the opposition leader told his troops not to conflate state and federal issues. But then he went to the turmoil in the Victorian Liberals, where controversial MP Deeming was yesterday suspended by the party for nine months following her appearance at an anti-trans rally that was also attended by neo-Nazis. “We can see in Victoria at the moment the damage that can be caused and the opportunities lost when we don’t act as a team, and when we talk about ourselves,” Dutton said, according to a briefing from a party room spokesperson. It was clarified that Dutton was referring to Deeming. Dutton said the Liberal candidate in the Aston byelection, Roshena Campbell, was doing a fantastic job, and that he expected Saturday’s result to be “tight”. Earlier, we reported that Albanese had said that anything less than a 5% swing to the Liberals would be a bad result for Dutton – so both men were in the business of expectation management today. The metaphorical Question Time warning bell has sounded The downhill slide to QT is about to begin, so make sure you have whatever you need to get through it. Alas, workplace health and safety rules limits what I can do, so another cup of coffee it is. It is going to be more legacy budget hang ups versus the cost of living, with a dash of housing. Liberals predicted to take Pittwater, defeating teal independent Jacqui Scruby The Liberals look set to claim Pittwater after the teal independent Jacqui Scruby slipped behind in the count in Pittwater this morning. Votes cast at early voting centres in Narrabeen and Pittwater have favoured the Liberal candidate, Rory Amon, putting him ahead by 649 votes. The initial count is now complete in almost all booths and early voting centres. Postal votes are expected to run in Amon’s favour as well. At lunchtime Amon had 50.8%of the two-party preferred vote to 49.2% for Scruby. The result means that teal candidates did not win any of the north side seats that they contested, though two community independents running on similar environmental and pro-climate action platforms did succeed: Michael Regan in Wakehurst and Judy Hannan in Wollondilly. Origin Energy’s prospective new owners have not contemplated selling off Eraring coal power plant As mentioned in an earlier post, the $18.7bn takeover of Origin Energy by Brookfield and MidOcean placed a bit of question mark over the future of the energy company (and Australia’s) biggest power plant, Eraring, in New South Wales. We noted that Brookfield and MidOcean’s media release didn’t repeat the 2025 date for Eraring that Origin had previously stated. So we asked them to clarify. A spokesperson for Brookfield told Guardian Australia: The earliest possible closure date for Eraring is August 2025. We have always said we won’t take capacity out of the system until replacement is online. During the recent NSW election, Labor in particular left open the possibility of buying back Eraring if needed. (Or, at least, didn’t rule it out.) The Coalition vacillated but the now former premier Dom Perrotet indicated a buyback could be considered if needed. Anyway, Brookfield’s spokesperson doesn’t seem keen to ventilate the idea. We haven’t contemplated a sell back … We wouldn’t sell Eraring if it meant keeping it open longer than it needs to be. In its statement, Brookfield played up the closure of Eraring as being key to cutting the business’s absolute carbon emissions by more than 70% by 2030 (presumably, compared with now). One thing to keep in mind is that Origin has stated it costs $200m to $250m a year in operating and capital spending to keep the plant running now. That’s before paying for the coal. There’s a fair chance that sum isn’t going to decline in coming years. Still, a lot can happen between now and 2025. As we noted in this pre-election piece, NSW’s electricity grid has its share of challenges ahead: About 1200 megawatts of generation capacity will drop off the grid by 29 April, with the closure of AGL‘s Liddell power plant in NSW’s Hunter Valley. Those power issues are also topical given the ACTU’s president, Michele O’Neil, is just now talking to the National Press Club about the need for a national energy transition authority to deal with the shift away from fossil fuels. ACTU still negative on nuclear defence policy The ACTU is not a fan of the nuclear sub deal (no surprise there, it has a longstanding “no nuclear” policy): Michelle O’Neil: The ACTU has a long-standing policy opposition to nuclear power, nuclear waste and proliferation. We also have a long-standing policy position that supports a nuclear-free defence policy. There are not new positions that have been developed in the last weeks and months. They are decades long and our position hasn’t changed. ACTU: wages must increase now Michele O’Neil on the need for wages to increase: Look, real wages have gone backwards by the greatest-ever amount, 4.5%, in the last 12 months. We’ve never seen such a decline in workers wages in our country. The idea that somehow we should step back from workers seeing their wage increases … the opposite is needed. People are struggling, there is a cost of living crisis, people need to see their wage increase and they need them now and we know every economist, everyone agrees that is no wage price spiral happening here. It’s not wages that are driving inflation, the sort of things that drive inflation is record profits. Price gouging by many larger companies. These other things making the difference in terms of inflation, you cannot blame workers for that. Workers need their share in terms of their wages and they will then spend those in those local communities and small businesses that are actually doing it tough as well. I welcome the fact that governments are listening to what is important and you’ve seen that in the election result in New South Wales on the weekend … You see … essential workers one day step up, save our lives, [with] your own life and family at risk, to [do] this day in, month out … while we’re in a crisis and, then not give them any wage increase? See the wages go backwards? See people abandon those industries and jobs that they love because they cannot live on them anymore and cannot handle the pressure of them? I really welcome the fact that the New South Wales people [have approved of a] commitment by the new New South Wales government to do something about that. ACTU president: leaving behind energy workers wouldn’t just be moral failure, it would be a massive missed opportunity Back at the national press club and the ACTU’s Michele O’Neil says politicians have stood in the way of attempts to transition, much like Donald Trump hampered American communities attempts to move forward: Here in Australia, we have our own Trumps. Politicians like Matt Canavan are more than happy to dress up and [have] coal workers as political props before hanging them out to dry. He thinks he can condescend to them because in his mind, they are just marks. But what I know is Australian energy workers are some of the most sophisticated and knowledgeable brokers in our economy. They know our great [network] better than anyone else because they are the ones that keep it running day in and day out. They are the express, and they know more about what is happening in our energy quickly than any politician I have met … leaving them behind in the transition wouldn’t just be a moral failure, [it] would be a massive missed opportunity. We need their expertise and more, because we have so much more work to do. Not only to transition to net zero but realise Australia’s potential as a renewable energy superpower. Affordable housing rally – in pictures Guardian Australia’s photographer-at-large, Mike Bowers, was at the affordable housing rally. None of these senators are on board with Labor’s fund, which means Labor does not have the numbers to get this through before the budget. Naplan marking underway Marking for Naplan is now underway after a range of reforms for the annual student assessment were rolled out by the education minister, Jason Clare. Some 4.4m online tests were completed this year amongst around 1.3 million students in years 3, 5, 7 and 9. It followed a sharp decline in participation in 2022, with around 20,000 extra students not sitting the tests - aligning in a fall in school attendance amid Covid, floods and flu outbreaks. Around 4.3m online tests were submitted last year, the first year Naplan moved to the digital format. Participation was lowest for disadvantaged young people, including those in regional and remote areas and for low-performing students. The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority’s CEO, David de Carvalho, said it was a “successful test event” due to close collaboration across the sector. For the first time this year, Naplan took place in March instead of May, while a new Naplan measurement scale was also introduced to streamline results. Assessment has moved from 10 bands to four levels of achievement: “exceeding, strong, developing and needs additional support”. de Carvalho: Having the tests earlier in the year means we will be able to return results to schools, parents and carers sooner, and that will help inform teaching and learning programs. Student achievement will this year be reported using proficiency standards, which provide simple and clear information on whether students are where they should be for their year level based primarily on what they have learnt in the previous year of school. A new Naplan measurement scale and time series are also being introduced. Recent ACARA research found the top three ways results were used amongst educators was to monitor progress over time, set goals and target teaching areas where students needed more support. Results will be sent to schools in term two and parents in term three. ACTU calls for ‘just energy transition’ to guide move to renewables The main point of Michele O’Neil’s speech is the ACTU wants the government to include a national energy transition authority in this year’s budget to guide the transition to renewables. We still have no federal justtransition policy. We still have a patchwork of uncoordinated programs and funding streams whose remit only incidentally overlap with the goals [of a] just transition declaration. This means confusion for workers and a lack of real planning for change. Their workplaces close down and they are left stranded without [the] support they need to find a new secure job. Or they see a looming date for closure and have no certainty about … whether they will be [a] job or a future for them in their communities. Without a well-funded, long-term plan for economic diversification, the regions [will] struggle to bring these new industries in. This means potential investors and companies have no certainty regarding how they should or even could play their part in a genuinely just transition. Coordination is urgently needed across multiple government departments and agencies working on the energy transition. Back on the housing fund for a moment: Daniel Andrews gives interview with Chinese broadcaster ahead of trade trip The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says he cannot imagine the state “without the Chinese influence”, in an interview with a Chinese broadcaster conducted before his four-day trade mission. Andrews’ trip has sparked backlash for the exclusion of Australian media and the lack of specific detail about who he would meet. The premier said his trip would focus on boosting the number of Chinese students studying in the state. Andrews told Phoenix TV – a Hong Kong-based state-owned broadcaster – that he was “proud” to have about 100,000 Chinese students in the state: It makes us a more dynamic city. It’s the biggest export industry that we have. The Chinese story is absolutely central to the Victorian story for more than 150 years. You can’t imagine a modern Victoria without the Chinese influence. Andrews added that “good friends can disagree”: That is always the approach I have taken. The interview was conducted in Melbourne prior to his departure for Beijing. ACTU boss says decarbonising the economy could generate hundreds of thousands of jobs The ACTU boss, Michele O’Neil, is at the National Press Club today. She is speaking on the need to transition Australia’s economy. I am speaking to you today because the Australian union movement knows it is not a choice between jobs and our climate, it is a responsibility to act on both. We are here because our previous federal government weaponised this false choice in order to [shrug] their responsibility to act on climate change. … Their refusal to act has made the job before us both more challenging and more urgent. We will need serious ambition to get it right. Climate change poses a profound material threat to the Australian way of life. To our ability to work, play and live in the places we call home. If we don’t find it within ourselves to take the necessary action in time, the lives of ordinary Australians will grow more gruelling and less safe with every passing year. But within that threat lies opportunity to rival any in our nation ‘s history. Decarbonising our economy could generate hundreds of thousands of good jobs, healthier and more equitable communities and a renewed national prosperity all while safeguarding Australians against spiralling climate disasters. To seize this enormous opportunity, we need to build an economy that restores the planet on which it relies. That means turning an extractive economy reliant on fossil carbon to a circular economy powered by clean energy, fundamental transformation that, according to the best science, we have at most three decades to execute. Seems Tony Burke has been sitting on that Barrie Cassidy appointment for quite some time – and has had the last laugh in this saga. Tony Burke and my oma – people who never forget a slight. Labor urges Victorian Liberal leader to expel Moira Deeming from party room Victoria’s acting premier, Jacinta Allan, has urged the opposition leader, John Pesutto, to expel the controversial MP Moira Deeming from the Liberal party room after she appeared to contradict his claims she made “important concessions” to avoid party room expulsion. A vote to expel Deeming from the Liberal party room was abandoned after MPs unanimously agreed to impose a nine-month suspension as a compromise. Pesutto argued this was due to concessions Deeming made after she attended an anti-transgender rights rally which was gatecrashed by neo-Nazis. But on Monday night Deeming took to Twitter to deny she condemned the organisers of the rally. Allan said Pesutto had “failed in his first test of leadership” by not expelling Deeming: He’s failed to stand up to hate and bigotry. Imagine being divided on whether you stand up for hate or bigotry. Back to you Barrie … at Old Parliament House Barrie Cassidy, the former Insiders host and Bob Hawke adviser (and journalist and Collingwood fan and all round Australian Great) has been named the new chair of the board of Old Parliament House. Tony Burke says there are “very few people who worked in both Old Parliament House and New Parliament House, who served in the press galleries of both buildings and the ministerial wings of both buildings”. The former Labor MP Gai Brodtmann has been reappointed to the board. Both get a three-year term. There’s more proof this morning that demand in the economy is holding up even as households adjust the proverbial pursestrings as official interest rates keep rising. For the month, retail sales were up 0.2%, seasonally adjusted, compared with January’s revised 1.8% increase, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. Sales were up 6.4% versus February 2022. Economists had offered a range of forecasts, as you might expect, with CBA for instance tipping a 0.3% drop and ANZ predicting they would rise 0.4%. The numbers will be looked at closely because the RBA doesn’t have a look to work with before its 4 April board rates meeting. We get February consumer price index numbers tomorrow, and that’s about it as far as key releases go. (And within the RBA, they apparently don’t put huge weight on the monthly CPI, saying they approach them with a pair of tongs, or similar. Quarterly numbers are more precise, they reckon.) Anyway, today’s retail sales seems to have prompted a bit of spurt for the Aussie dollar. That’s usually a good guide that another rate rise next month is just a tad more likely now we’ve had the retail numbers. Before today’s release, investors had been betting there was a 91% chance the RBA would pause at its April meeting. That ratio will likely drop. The parliament sitting has begun. And question time is in just under two hours. HOW LUCKY ARE WE? Labor party room report, part two (continued from last post) A partyroom spokesperson said Albanese told the caucus that “it’s very clear in the amendment that parliament is primary”, referring to the parliament’s ability to make laws about the voice. Albanese noted that a referendum would be difficult, but not impossible, without bipartisan support, noting the opposition of the Nationals and the criticism of the Liberals. However, after a question from a caucus member about Liberals who do support the voice (there are a few, don’t forget) Albanese said the government was still engaging with such supporters, and that there would be many Liberal and National voters who back the referendum too. However the PM also noted there weren’t too many Liberal moderates left in the parliament. The Aston byelection is this weekend. Albanese appeared to flatten prospects of Labor bucking a century of history and winning the byelection as the government: the PM noted that the average swing against a government is 5 to 6% in a byelection, and claimed that if the Liberals didn’t achieve such a swing, it would be a bad result for the opposition leader, Peter Dutton. Albanese repeated claims that Dutton was “in hiding”, referring to his non-appearance in the NSW election. The Labor party room report The PM, Anthony Albanese, has told his Labor partyroom that “parliament is primary” as a result of the proposed amendment to the constitution to set up the Indigenous voice and that the government is continuing its outreach to Liberal moderates to win their support. Albanese also appeared to tamp down talk of Labor winning the Aston byelection, saying that anything less than a 5% swing against Labor would be a bad result for the opposition leader, Peter Dutton. The Labor caucus meeting this morning included applause for the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, with the constitutional alteration bill due to be introduced to parliament this week. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, also got applause after securing a deal with the crossbench to pass the safeguard mechanism climate bill. To substantive matters, Albanese noted that “some” people (i.e. the Greens) were planning to oppose the government’s housing Australia future fund. The PM noted that the government was doing a lot of negotiating with the crossbench on major legislation because “of the pathological obsession with opposing everything by the No-alition” (Labor’s snappy new term for the Coalition). On the referendum, Albanese said it was “a precondition of success” that the government was on the same page as its referendum working group of Indigenous leaders – a reference to the group’s insistence that the consultation body be able to talk to executive government, which was a phrase that some conservative critics had been concerned about and called for the government to scrap. Albanese decided to go with the advice of the Indigenous leaders instead. New Zealand and China in diplomatic talks At the same time Australia is seeking to “stabilise” its relationship with China, New Zealand is also continuing its diplomatic efforts with Beijing. The latest sign of that is the visit to China last week by the NZ foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, for meetings with her counterpart, Qin Gang, and also the director of the central foreign affairs commission, Wang Yi. Interestingly, Mahuta has said Aukus came up during the discussions. AAP reports that Mahuta said the Chinese government “acknowledged” New Zealand’s position on Aukus: We’re not a part of those arrangements … Our concern is not to see the militarisation of the Pacific – that the treaty of Rarotonga be upheld – and that’s the basis upon which our assurances from Australia have been gained in relation to those arrangements. New Zealand has a longstanding anti-nuclear policy, while the Australian government has repeatedly said its acquisition of nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines is consistent with the treaty of Rarotonga. The treaty, also known as the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, commits its parties not to station nuclear weapons in the region. For more on the Australian government’s talks with China, see this story from this morning: Not a huge crowd for the housing rally – it seems to be mostly the Greens and the CFMEU. Family law reforms to restore ‘best interests of the child’ as guiding principle The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, is introducing amendments to the Family Law Act which will remove the Howard-era “equal responsibility” which has led to some thinking custody in family law courts should be resolved as equally. Dreyfus says the government is putting what is best for the children back as the foundational principle of custody disputes. He told ABC Radio Melbourne: This bill will restore the best interests of children as the key guiding principle of the family law system. And an important part of this … is repealing the confusing and often misunderstood presumption about parental responsibility, which has taken the focus away from the needs of children. Equal responsibility did not mean equal custody, but there was confusion, Dreyfus said. It led to an unacceptable situation where abusive partners have a false belief that they have a right to equal time against the wishes of the other parent and their children. It happens inside and outside the court as parents negotiate parenting arrangements and it’s caused untold harm to children. This bill will make it clear again that the best interests of children are paramount. We have a new New South Wales leadership team. The interim cabinet: The premier, Chris Minns. The deputy premier and education and early learning minister, Prue Car. The treasurer and gig economy minister, Daniel Mookhey. The environment and heritage minister, Penny Shape. The roads, arts, night-time economy and music minister, John Graham. The health, regional health, mental health and Illawarra and South Coast minister, Ryan Park. The transport minister, Jo Haylen. The NSW attorney general, Michael Daley. Andrews attracts criticism over China trip Victoria’s acting premier, Jacinta Allan, has defended Daniel Andrews’ trade trip to China, amid criticism of the exclusion of Australian media. Andrews’ four-day trip – focused on enticing Chinese students to Victoria – has attracted backlash for a lack of transparency and specific detail about who the Victorian premier will meet during the visit. The federal Coalition on Monday argued the exclusion of journalists meant the public would be forced to rely on coverage by China’s state-run media. Speaking to reporters, Allan said Andrews would be available to answer questions about his trip upon his return: The premier has been particularly transparent in addressing his trip before he left. I’m sure he’ll be transparent in addressing his trip when he is back. Allan confirmed Andrews had touched down in China. The premier’s private office will be providing daily updates of Andrews’ trip. Treasurer speaks with US and European counterparts The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, had a phone call with the US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, and the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, earlier this morning, talking all things world economy (not great), the banking system in Europe and America (also not great) and the impact of higher interest rates around the globe (you guessed it – not great). Chalmers will convene a meeting of the council of financial regulators on Thursday to keep an eye on whether there is is any fallout for Australia’s financial system. Chalmers said: It’s clear from my conversations that international authorities are prepared to do what’s necessary to reassure markets at a time of uncertainty and volatility. Coordinated action by central banks and international financial authorities has helped ease some of the concerns in global funding markets, but they remain vigilant. There’s no doubt the volatility in the financial system is contributing to uncertainty more generally in the global economic outlook. We’re not immune to what’s coming at us from overseas, but our own economy and financial system are well-regulated, well-capitalised and well placed to respond to these challenges. I’ve been closely engaging with our regulators who advise our own institutions are in a good position to withstand the pressures coming at us from around the world. Pocock on housing fund: ‘better than nothing is not a good policy response’ The independent senator David Pocock has been all over the airwaves today. He popped up on Sky News a few minutes ago to say he has had “some good discussions” with the government about the housing future fund, but he would keep pushing for a more ambitious policy response to the housing crisis. I’m saying let’s have more ambition - this is a huge issue across the country ... I’m going to keep pushing them as hard as I can. Pocock said he was not sure the government would actually bring on the housing future fund bill for debate in the Senate this week, meaning it would allow for another month for talks: We can do better and just saying this is better than nothing is not a good policy response. Ley: alleged offensive remark by Sam Rae ‘a test for Anthony Albanese’ The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, is speaking to Sydney radio 2GB host Ray Hadley about the remark the Liberal party allege Labor MP Sam Rae made during a debate yesterday. Members of the opposition allege Rae yelled “at least I have my own children” during a speech being given by LNP MP Angie Bell on a childcare bill. Rae admits to having made an interjection during the debate but has categorically denied having said the remarks. Ley tells Hadley she is convinced he said it. Don’t forget if Anthony Albanese hadn’t intervened in Victoria’s preselection, there would in all likelihood be a woman representing the seat of Hawke instead of this Labor hack. That’s just an aside that people might like to note but yes, the prime minister promised a kinder, more respectful parliament. And is this what he meant? So I actually think this is a test for Anthony Albanese, what will be the consequences for this unacceptable attack on a woman in our workplace and as you say, it is a workplace and we should behave in a professional fashion and no one should think this low and it’s a disgusting reflection on any woman. ACU staff and students protest in solidarity with LGBTQ+ community Staff and students across the Australian Catholic University’s seven national campuses are dressing up in rainbow today in a show of solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community, following weeks of controversy over the university’s removal of pride flags. In an email sent during WorldPride celebrations, librarians at the university were ordered to remove the public display of rainbow flags and stickers across campuses, which weren’t considered “appropriate” at the institution. ACU Ally Network’s co-convener, Noah Riseman, who is also a professor of history at the university’s Melbourne campus, said students had reached out “horrified” by the move, citing they no longer felt safe in university spaces. Rainbow Up ACU day coincides with the formal opening of the Blacktown library campus at 11am, attended by the Bishop of Parramatta. Since the news broke about ACU banning rainbow flags in public spaces, there’s been an outcry of people upset and we wanted a way to show support and affirmation for LGBTIQA+ students and staff. Rainbow Up ACU is an opportunity to do just that – for people to come out and show LGBTIQA+ students and staff are welcome here. The CEO has advised they’re not interfering but have briefed Blacktown police because of recent action in Western Sydney. The student president of the LGBTIQ+ network at the Canberra campus, Amelia Chapman, said the university’s decision felt “like a betrayal” for a lot of students. She said today was about “turning that frustration into unity” and a show of respect and support. We sent an open letter, showing we were unhappy with the situation and have felt dismissed. All we’re doing today is showing up – being visible, being loud, being proud. As small as it may seem to some people it feels big and stakes are much higher for queer people right now. The deputy vice-chancellor and CEO of the ACU, Dr Stephen Weller, said the university welcomed events like Rainbow Up day “proceeding in a respectful and inclusive manner”. Our university encourages a healthy exchange of ideas that represent the wide spectrum of our diverse community. ACU is committed to providing a safe and respectful environment for all staff, students and visitors. Education, faith, respect and acceptance are at the heart of our mission as a Catholic university. Staff and students who identify as LGBTIQ+ are welcomed and valued at our university. The ceremony is over and Labor’s NSW cabinet is officially sworn in. I have never wanted a piece of cake more in my life. Aston byelection early votes ‘below expectations’ It seems the voters of Aston are not particularly enthused by the byelection – the electoral commission is concerned with low turnout, with the number of votes cast so far “below expectations”. The byelection is this Saturday. It has been a very low key campaign so far, and one Peter Dutton has given a wide berth. The AEC’s commissioner, Tom Rogers, said voting numbers are down by more than 5% over the same period in the 2022 election. Typically, if someone casts their vote early in one election they’ll do so in the next one as well - and we’re not quite seeing that here which makes us worry about low participation. There are a lot of Aston residents who will need to get to their local polling place this Saturday. We’ve sent every Aston household an official guide to the byelection, we’re communicating where we can through advertising, social media and in discussion with media representatives. We’re even sending text messages and emails this week to Aston residents we have those contact details for - it’s a reminder of their right and responsibility to vote. That’s more communication than the AEC have ever done before for a single byelection, which shows you how worried they are about turnout. Aston’s three pre-poll voting centres will be open until 6pm on Friday night, and 32 polling places will be open on polling day – Saturday 1 April – from 8am to 6pm. For locations and opening hours, visit aec.gov.au/aston or call them on 13 23 26. ACCC launching inquiry on banks and savings The ACCC is looking at Australia’s $1.3tn in deposits to see if banks are holding up their end of the savings deposit bargain (things like how slow it takes them to pass on interest rate rises, which are also meant to apply to term deposits, as well as bank loans and fees, that sort of things). Gina Cass-Gottlieb, the ACCC’s chair, told the AFR banking summit: To inform the ACCC’s inquiry, we will be requesting information from suppliers of retail deposit products, and working closely with other financial regulators to draw on their expertise and data. We will also soon release a public issues paper, seeking stakeholder input on a range of issues. These will include: How banks and other authorised deposit-taking institutions set their rates on retail deposit products. How their approaches differ from rate setting for credit products. The role of deposits in their overall funding mix. Consumer information and switching. NSW Labor’s leader, Chris Minns, has been sworn in as the 47th premier of New South Wales. He took the oath in front of Governor Margaret Beazley on Tuesday morning at Government House, becoming the first Labor premier in 12 years. The interim NSW cabinet was also sworn into office, including the deputy premier and education minister, Prue Car. Labor needs 47 seats to form a majority government but was stuck on 45 on Monday afternoon as the Coalition pushed ahead in a number of seats still in doubt. The NSW Labor leader Chris Minns has sworn an oath on a bible and has signed the little piece of paper that will officially make him premier. There are still seats to be decided: at this stage, it looks like Labor will be short a majority, but will be in a minority government with crossbenchers – including the Greens. The Guardian’s Paul Karp: negotiations on housing future fund haven’t progressed And there you have it. Housing fund all but dead in the water this week, meaning it won’t make it ahead of the budget. Hard to host a rally outside parliament calling for more action and then sign up for a fund with not a lot of action. It seems Margaret Beazley likes a sense of occasion. Her excellency is addressing the room, telling the incoming government: I pay my respects to their eldest past, present and emerging and to all the nations across our state. There is a phrase in the Gadigal language and indeed it goes right across the Eora Nation, which I particularly like, because it is a way of greeting every person in a room. It means, quite simply, “to all people”. So to all of you this morning, here in this room, this morning, is a unique moment in your lives and I’m going to suggest that you savour it, because, premier-elect, ministers-designate, it’s not going to last very long, because in a moment, when you take the various oaths and pledges that you take – as premier, as ministers – you will drop the “elect” and you’ll drop the “designate”, but it is a moment of anticipation. Governor swears in NSW Labor government’s leadership team Her Excellency The Honourable Margaret Beazley, Companion of the Order of Australia, King’s Counsel, governor of the State of New South Wales in the commonwealth of Australia (full title) is swearing in the NSW leadership team into their new roles, meaning NSW has a new government (officially). You usually know how close a government is to getting the support it needs for passing legislation when it lists it for debate. So what is not there is usually as important as what is. Amy explains: party room meetings The parliament sitting will begin at midday. It always starts later on a Tuesday because of the party room meetings. For those who are new here, or have missed the explanation in the past, the party room meetings happen each parliamentary sitting and it is where the parties nut out their position on legislation, issues, or questions (the government caucus discuss bills going forward, cabinet decisions and take questions/concerns/queries on legislation or issues). Those meetings are closed and confidential. BUT. In a weird Canberra quirk, a briefing for media is then held after the meetings, where a designated person from each party room reads out the minutes, answers questions and gives very scant detail on what went on. All of this is for some reason “on background” and can not be attributed. Names aren’t given when it comes to who spoke up. “a member raised concerns on” or “two MPs asked questions on” is the usual formulation, so it is up to journalists to work contacts to find out the who and how serious. But when you read “party room sources” on a Tuesday or Wednesday, that is where most of it comes from. It has always struck me as strange that it is not on the record given it is an all in, but this place is weird. The party room meetings are beginning to break up The Greens are out first – we’ll let you know what went on in that meeting very soon. Trauma support line Full Stop Australia may have to close unless $500,000 in funding can be found Full Stop Australia, which provides counselling and support to sexual and domestic violence survivors, may have to close its doors unless $500,000 in government funding is secured. The service runs a 24-hour national trauma support crisis line, but with demand having increased by 50% to 5,000 calls in the last year, funding has run out. Community, philanthropic and corporate donations have plugged the gap, but without government funding, CEO Hayley Foster says the service will not be able to keep going: As is widely acknowledged, there are substantial gaps and shortfalls in sexual, domestic and family violence trauma counselling services nation-wide, particularly for First Nations communities, refugees and asylum seekers, people in regional and remote areas, children and LGBTIQA+ communities. The 1800FULLSTOP trauma counselling service helps to fill many of these gaps, especially for those who don’t have access to trauma specialist counselling locally, or who cannot afford the Medicare gap, or who cannot seek medical assistance for privacy/safety reasons. Foster has meetings with the prime minister’s office, the minister for women and the attorney general in a bid to secure funding. Greens celebrate a new first in NSW election And in NSW – a little bit of Greens history has been made: Queensland proposal on restricting times rent can be increased not linked to CPI The proposal put forward by the Queensland Labor government won’t stop rents from going up from $200 or even $400 a week – because it has walked away from looking at linking increases to CPI. Instead, a Queensland landlord would only be able to raise rents once a year – but by how much is still up to the landlord. Collins tells crossbenchers vulnerable people cannot afford delay on housing future fund Julie Collins’ housing future fund bill is still struggling to find the support it needs to pass the senate. There is a rally today outside parliament, calling for the government to go further in its ambition. David Pocock and the Greens will be taking part. But Collins is now moving to the argument Chris Bowen used with the safeguard legislation – it is this or nothing, and does the crossbench want nothing? (Not exactly ambitious but this is where we are at.) Collins told Radio National: This bill is urgent in terms of vulnerable people in Australia today who need this bill to pass the parliament. What we’re talking about here is a $10bn housing fund. It is the single biggest investment from a federal government, single biggest investment in social and affordable homes in more than a decade. It is obviously very substantial. It’s obviously not the only thing we’re doing in housing, but as you rightly point out, people that are on the frontline dealing with vulnerable people every day – such as Homelessness Australia, National Shelter, community housing providers – all say that this bill needs to get done and we need to get it done quickly. And we know that the longer we delay, the less homes are on the ground quickly. We are absolutely as a federal government doing our share, and we are lifting from where the former government was substantially. The $10bn is the most significant investment by a federal government in social and affordable housing in more than a decade. It is very significant, and what I would say to the Greens and to other crossbenchers in the Senate is that vulnerable people cannot afford for this to delay. If their response is “it’s our way or zero”, I mean, that is just unacceptable when you’ve got vulnerable people on the ground who need housing today. Fossil fuel industry thinks safeguard mechanism deal will hurt gas supply The fossil fuel industry is not happy with the safeguard mechanism deal, so surely that is a win for the Greens and a vote of confidence the legislation will do something. The Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association’s chief executive, Samantha McCulloch, said in a statement it would stop gas supply: New gas supply investment needs policy and regulatory certainty but instead, the Labor-Greens deal creates additional barriers to investment, further diminishing the investment environment and adding to the growing list of regulatory challenges facing the sector. But Chris Bowen says gas will be just fine: That’s just not right, of course. What we’re requiring is international-best practice for all facilities, including gas. Gas does not get a free pass from the requirement for new facilities to be international best practice when it comes to emissions. In relation to the proposals that are currently on the books … they’re for export. Of course, one of them is covered by the Western Australian reservation policy but they are being developed for export. None of them feed into the east coast gas market, none of them. Simply they’ll be required to comply with international best practice and indeed Australian best practice and several gasfields have been operating on those rules since 2007. That’s not an onerous [burden] with the gas industry … there are sensible ways of meeting [that]. Government puts Twitter on notice over ‘spotty’ engagement regarding safety The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has held a press conference with eSafety commissioner Julie Inman-Grant about keeping Indigenous Australians safe online. Perhaps the most interesting point was Inman-Grant’s observation that Twitter’s engagement has been “inconsistent” due to the “lack of trust and safety staffing”. She said: I met with the Asia-Pacific public policy representative last week. Her team has been decimated, she’s trying to cover all of the Asia-Pacific. We have some legal notices around child sexual abuse material, sexual extortion and their algorithms and whether they might be promoting harmful content. They have committed to me that they’re working on this and will get it to us in time. They have a severely diminished trust and safety team, we escalate directly to headquarters when we see harm. We ... have seen some recent positive activity in terms of taking down content. But I would say it’s spotty, it’s less consistent. Rowland added that she’d written to Twitter noting the “decimation” of Australian staff, and setting out expectations they meet requirements of Australian law. Twitter hasn’t responded, which has been noted. She said: They have been put on notice, the first priority of the Albanese government is to keep Australians safe. I’ll continue to consult the regulator, the eSafety commissioner to ensure whatever action is graduated and proportionate. Pollies vs press touch footy – in pictures It is also politicians vs press sport season, which is another tradition where a team of press gallery members play a team of politicians outside of business hours. You can tell Michael McCormack has been in many of these team photos – he’s the only one who knows how to sit properly. Mike Bowers tells me the politicians won, four to three. Back on Origin Energy’s takeover by Brookfield and MidOcean – it’s subject to shareholder approval, but with the price about 53% above what it was trading at before the bid, there shouldn’t be much fuss. Anyway, Brookfield says it will accelerate renewables investment and “make a material difference to achieving Australia’s net zero targets at this crucial time in its energy transition” (ping, Chris Bowen): The business plan for Origin Energy Markets contemplates at least $20bn of additional investment during the next decade to construct up to 14 gigawatts of new renewable generation and storage facilities in Australia. This is expected to enable the retirement of one of Australia’s largest coal-fired power generation plants, Eraring, and will be undertaken with the highest regard for network reliability and security. (Note: No timetable given.) Origin accounts for about a quarter of electricity in the grid now, and Brookfield’s plans represent about “one-fifth of the new utility-scale renewable capacity identified by the Australian Energy Market Operator that is required to be developed across the National Electricity Market through to 2030”, it said. Brookfield’s credentials include developing about 25GW of generating capacity now, with a 110GW development pipeline globally. MidOcean, meanwhile, says it “recognises that LNG and natural gas are integral to the economies of Asia and Australia and is committed to continue delivering meaningful gas volumes into Australia’s east coast domestic market”. Guess we’ll see if “meaningful” satisfies governments eyeing a lack of local gas, after some bright sparks thought it was a great idea to lock east coast gas to global markets while forgetting to reserve some for domestic use. WA’s 15% reservation was panned by the industry at the time (circa 2006) but it didn’t stop $100bn in investment in that state’s gas sector. It’s quiet – too quiet … Things are a little quiet this morning, as the party room meetings are on, which tends to corral the MPs into their respective rooms. The press gallery is also having a photo – it’s a tradition which happens once a parliament (or so, there is no prescribed method) when the gallery journalists gather in one spot, a timer is set (or a poor parliament house worker is corralled into hitting the shutter) and a photo is taken and put on the press gallery hall walls. Alas, I shall miss it, as the blog stops for no one (and also I have not brushed my hair in more than three days). ‘Critical’ for Liberal party to prove it has listened to Australians by next election: Birmingham The Liberal’s Simon Birmingham was asked on Sky News this morning whether there was any truth to Anthony Albanese’s criticism the opposition had a “tin ear” when it came to learning lessons: I think there’s always a case for political parties to make sure they’re listening. And it’s going to be critical for us as we work over the next two years towards the next federal election, in 18 months or two years’ time to ensure that we have a compelling set of policies that have listened to the election, including effective policies to achieve Australia’s emission reduction targets. That will be a key point of credibility that we have to outline and demonstrate to the electorate, along with, of course demonstrating that we also have the types of policies to actually deal with the cost-of-living pressures that Australians are facing at present, which clearly the Labor party have no plans or policies to effectively do. Allegra Spender announces lineup for Friday tax roundtable Wentworth’s independent MP, Allegra Spender, has organised a tax roundtable for Friday. Spender has spoken about the need for tax reform – and she is serious. There are some very big thinkers among the group she has pulled together: Prof Robert Breunig – director, Tax and Transfer Policy Institute (Australian National University) Robert Carling – senior fellow, Centre for Independent Studies Dr John Daley – partner, EY Port Jackson Partners, and professorial fellow, University of Melbourne. Formerly executive director, Grattan Institute. Dr Ken Henry – chair, Australian Climate Biodiversity Foundation. Formerly secretary of the Treasury and chair of National Australia Bank. Prof Greg Kaplan – cofounder, e61 Institute, and professor of economics, University of Chicago Michelle de Niese – executive director, The Corporate Tax Association Danielle Wood – CEO, Grattan Institute Social housing sector backs Labor’s housing future fund as a ‘good start’ The Greens and the crossbench – including David Pocock and Lidia Thorpe – aren’t over the line on the housing fund as yet.There is a rally being held in Canberra today on housing, with calls for rental freezes and more affordable housing. The government has received a boost for its legislation from the social housing sector, though. Community Housing Industry Association’s CEO, Wendy Hayhurst, has spoken today about how the housing fund (a $10bn term deposit, where the interest will be used to fund and maintain 30,000 homes over the next five years) was a start. Hayhurst told ABC News Breakfast: We have been arguing for the … federal government to invest in social affordable rental housing for a very, very long time. So in principle, we’re very pleased that the federal government has come forward with these three bills to establish the housing Australia future fund, to establish a national housing agency … and also to set up an independent housing supply and affordability council to advise them. So the package of measures we think is a good start and the start that needs to be made now. We know it isn’t sufficient. We have done our own research. We know the census, last week, was at least 123,000 Australians on census night were homeless. We have done further analysis, we know that around about 650,000 households were either homeless or in rental stress. Low-income households pay more than 30% of their income on housing. So it’s a massive problem. What we’re saying is: the legislation is a start to make a difference. As has been anticipated for some time, the electricity giant Origin Energy has been taken over after its board accepted a $18bn-plus bid by Brookfield and MidOcean Energy. The so-called binding scheme implementation deed follows most of the deal announced back in November. The bid was worth $9 a share then and after negotiations that price has been trimmed to about $8.91 each. Here’s how we reported it at the time: There will still be a bunch of regulatory hurdles to clear, with Canadian asset manager Brookfield and US based MidOcean needing foreign investment review board approval, for starters. The competition implications will also feature. Assuming the takeover gets all the appropriate approvals, the deal means Australia will only have one publicly listed energy player of any size: AGL Energy. Origin says it will accelerate investments into renewable energy in the section to be run by Brookfield. A lot of interest will focus on the future of Eraring, the 2,880MW coal plant (Australia’s largest), which Origin has said it wants to close in 2025. Let’s see. The gas assets, mostly in Queensland, will be MidOcean’s concern, and subject to a gas price cap for domestic users for about another year. Also an area of flux. Bowen: emissions reduction ambitions are now reflected in the legislation Chris Bowen responded to the “half of the projects” line on that same program: No, that’s Adam’s talking point … he’s entitled to his talking points, but that’s not what we negotiated. What we negotiated is a very clear cap on emissions which is perfectly reasonable and sensible for the country. I thank Adam for his engagement on behalf of the Green[s]. He had a list of demands and clearly in negotiation, many of those were ruled out, but we continue to work on the things we could agree on. What we agreed on is that the emissions reduction – that we outlined is our ambition in January as part of these reforms – should be reflected in the legislation. And there should be various mechanisms, CCA advice, transparency, public transparency about whether that budget is likely to be met, whether it’s been threatened, including if there are any new proposals, we have already committed to outlining their emissions through Tanya Plibersek’s process, reviewing the Samuel Review, that will feed into the safeguard system now … And the minister of the day, me – for the foreseeable future and for a long time I hope – and my successors will be obliged to consider policy options if that carbon budget is not being met. That’s perfectly appropriate, and new facilities will need to comply with international best practice when it comes to emissions reduction. We made that clear as our proposal in January and we provided further clarity about how that will work yesterday. Bandt: first time Australia has had a hard limit on coal and gas pollution Adam Bandt on ABC News Breakfast summed up the safeguard negotiations: Coal and gas take a bit hit as a result of the changes secured by the Greens. For the first time now in this country, there’ll be a limit on how much coal and gas and other corporations can actually pollute. They won’t be able to offset their way out of that by buying tree-planting permits on the other side of the country. And what that does is it puts a limit on coal and gas expanding. Now, that’s really significant because under Labor’s plan originally, pollution from coal and gas were set to go up; that’s because coalmines and gas mines … could just buy some tree-planting permits to offset their pollution. Pollution from coal and gas were set to soar under the original safeguard. We put a hard limit on that. That means, on our estimate, about half of those 116 new coal and gas projects that are in the pipeline won’t be able to go ahead. Secondly, for the other ones that Labor still wants to open, they’re now going to have to go through a test under the legislation, or pass what’s call[ed an] add[ed] safeguard trigger. … if those new projects are going to lift real pollution above the levels that they’re at, the minister can take steps to restrict them or indeed stop them from going ahead and so that means now every new coal and gas project has to pass through a new test – and if it goes ahead, it will be squarely on the Labor government’s hands, given they [have] got the power to stop it. Views on the safeguard mechanism: Greens and Labor reasonably happy, Coalition less so Both Adam Bandt and Chris Bowen have been on the media victory lap this morning over the safeguard mechanism. The Greens say they didn’t get no new coal or gas, but that the hard cap on emissions they won will mean that projects will hit a pollution trigger which they won’t be able to emissions trade their way out of. Labor says it took amendments that were in the spirit of the legislation and will be able to put the scheme in place for the 1 July open trading deadline. The Coalition doesn’t like any of it and is very upset at the outcome of the negotiations it was not part of at any stage because it made a decision to bow out at the starting blocks, even though the legislation was based on Abbott-era legislation and business and industry were pleading with it to come on board because they wanted investment certainty. Queensland to introduce rent increase limits The Queensland government has announced it will limit rent increases to once a year, as the government prepares to meet stakeholders at Tuesday’s housing roundtable. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, made the announcement on Twitter, saying the government was “taking action to give people who are renting a fairer go.” Weekly rents are rapidly increasing - sometimes going up $200 or even $400. It’s not right. That’s why we’re proposing to limit rent increases to once a year, rather than every six months. In Queensland, landlords can currently increase rents every six months. The measure would bring Queensland in line with Australian jurisdictions like Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales. Queensland’s Make Renting Fair Campaign has been calling on the government to limit rent increases to 10% above CPI like the ACT government does. The premier had said last week the government was “very seriously” considering a rent cap, drawing immediate backlash from the real estate sector. The deputy premier Steven Miles said such a cap could be tied to CPI, but the government appears to have since walked away from the idea. It comes as the government is set to hold a housing roundtable with stakeholders on Tuesday, which is expected to have 30 to 40 participants. Amy’s analysis on Moira Deeming So the short version of that interview is: Moira Deeming is suspended and not a member of the Liberal party, so what she does for the next nine months is for her to answer for. And in nine months’ time, the Liberal party room will review her conduct and decide whether she has met the spirit of the suspension terms. But Pesutto ain’t spending any more time on that (to paraphrase Bob Katter). Victorian Liberals: ‘we’ve dealt with’ the Deeming issue and are ‘moving on’ So what happens in nine months, when the suspension period ends? Well, there’ll obviously be consideration by [the] party room about whether Moira has acted consistently with the outcome of the party room decision. John Pesutto says it is up to Moira Deeming to prove to the party room that she has taken on board their concerns to see whether or not she will be coming back. I don’t want to be spending time having to come back to these issues. We’ve dealt with it. We’ve dealt with it yesterday, and we’re moving on. Is this what Pesutto wants to be spending his time on? Do you think, Patricia, for one moment [that] I want to be speaking to you about this this morning and not about corruption or project blowouts? … If I can make this point for all of your listeners, to offer them this assurance – I know these things are not what I want to be talking about, what your listeners want to be listening to. But this was important. I had to mark this turning point for the party. And to make it clear that going forward, we will always, as I said before, [be] being inclusive, welcoming and represent the diversity of our community and all its facets. Pesutto gives no answer on if Deeming can continue to promote anti-trans views as part of Liberals But John Pesutto also can’t answer whether Moira Deeming can continue to campaign against trans rights – a stance Deeming had before she was in the parliament and a key feature of her first speech to the Victorian parliament. Look, what what I have always said from the very start, is that as leader of the Victorian Liberal party, I want public debate not just in the state but nationally, to be respectful and civil and courteous, and to be inclusive so that people can participate in discussions. I am a supporter of free speech, but any connection of the Liberal party with people who share platforms with people who are extremely … people in hate speech is a concern to me and will never be acceptable in the party. Victorian Liberals on Moira Deeming’s behaviour: ‘a real problem’ if it continues Back on ABC Radio RN Breakfast, the Victorian Liberal leader, John Pesutto, is saying he is “very concerned” over Moira Deeming’s tweets, where she said she did not condemn people involved in the anti-trans rights rallies where neo-Nazi’s attended and performed the Nazi salute on the steps of the Victorian parliament. Pesutto told the media yesterday that Deeming had condemned people during the party room meeting. Deeming tweeted yesterday that she had not, reassuring some of the people involved “don’t worry” as she had “never” condemned them. Pesutto told Patricia Karvelas that Deeming’s suspension is “not off to a good start” but that Deeming has nine months to prove herself to the party. But he can’t say whether or not she has already blown it. Well, I’m not happy with those tweets, and they’re very great concern and will represent if that continues, it will obviously represent a real problem going forward for Moira to return the [party]. David Pocock spoke to ABC Radio AM this morning and announced he would be voting for the safeguard mechanism: As a result of the amendments we’ve seen, announced today by minister Bowen and Adam Bandt and then in subsequent conversations and and some further commitments from the government, I’ll be supporting the safeguard mechanism. And that’s the last number the government needs – the legislation will pass the Senate. Greens: housing future fund ‘doesn’t even touch the sides of the problem’ In some ways, it seems that coming to an agreement on the housing fund is harder than what we just saw on the safeguard mechanism. Adam Bandt says the parties are not where they need to be to come to an agreement – he says, because Labor’s policy isn’t doing enough. Labor’s put forward a policy that just does not address the scale of the crisis that we’re in. We’ve seen rents grow seven times faster than wages, people are unable to find an affordable place to live. And there’s nothing in this proposal that’s going to help them, and … as almost every group has said … the size of Labor’s proposal doesn’t even touch the sides of the problem and in fact, at the end of Labor’s plan, the waiting list for social affordable housing is going to be longer than it is at the start. So we are pushing them to address the scale of the rental crisis that we’re facing in this country and to step up and increase their offer. Greens: ‘We’re a chunk of the way there’ on stopping new coal and gas The Greens leader Adam Bandt says that any new coal or gas projects which open in Australia “is on Labor”. He was asked about the share price for companies such as Woodside dropping at the news and tells ABC Radio RN Breakfast Investors see the writing on the wall. They know that coal and gas is on its way out and understand that the hard cap negotiated by the Greens means there’s a limit on coal and gas expansion in this country from now on. We just can’t keep expanding coal and gas and stay below the hard cap. That’s what we’ve what we’ve legislated. I suspect that will mean … I know that you see lots of movements in the share market and who knows what will happen in the future, but I think they have clearly understood that the implication of this is that coal and gas can’t keep expanding because that is what the science demands … from now on. Every new coal and gas project has to go through this pollution test, and the government’s got the power to stop it … I heard someone from the Australian Industry Group saying that it’s likely to mean that projects are less likely to go ahead. And I think that’s right, because that is what we need to do to tackle the climate crisis. So we’re a chunk of the way there, and now we’ve got to get the rest of the way there. And … the only obstacle to stopping all new coal and gas mines from being opened is now Labor. Bowen: Liberal concern over voice’s impact on fossil fuels and interest rates ‘cheap and pathetic attempt’ to derail referendum The energy minister, Chris Bowen, is on ABC Radio RN Breakfast talking about the safeguard mechanism (the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, is up next). It’s pretty much what we heard yesterday, but Bowen also addressed Julian Leeser’s attempt during question time to muddy the Indigenous voice to parliament. He was asked whether or not the voice would have impact on things like fossil fuel projects, as they often involve traditional lands. The principle is … that we want the voice, when it’s established, to be able to advise government on matters that are important to Indigenous people. Now, I saw the opposition yesterday trying to cause trouble, say [the voice would be able to] advise the Reserve Bank on interest rates, and you’re going to see more of this and the prime minister is rightly keeping the focus on where it should be, not on these attempts at distraction by the Liberals or anyone else to say, ‘Oh, look, this voice is more complicated’. I mean … what a cheap and pathetic attempt by the Liberals to try and derail the voice by saying it’s going to give advice on all these things. It’s a very simple principle here – if it’s a policy decision which is directly relevant to our First Nations people … the voice will be able to interact with government on matters that they regard as important to Indigenous people. And of course, as we’ve said many many times, the government then will … take into account that and any other representations we receive from others. Indigenous children three times as likely to experience internet hate speech than national average The federal minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, says “more work is needed” to address online harm in the leadup to the Voice referendum. The eSafety Commissioner today released a report on the online experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. It says that Indigenous children are much more likely to use the internet to make friends, connect with people from different backgrounds, play games and post their own music or video content than national averages. Indigenous children are also far more likely to engage in online civic engagement – such as discussing social and political problems – and reading news than other children their age. But the report also warned of negative experiences above the national average. Some 68% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children said they had been treated in a hurtful or nasty way, with 29% having had offensive things said to them, while 76% had been exposed to potentially harmful online material like violent images or sexual content. The results came from a large online survey of parents and kids. Burney said technology was a great tool being used to build connections and boost civic engagement among Aboriginal children, but that the government was looking to better help kids. “Today’s research from the eSafety Commissioner is a reminder it also carries risks, with young Indigenous Australians more likely to be exposed to harmful content or hate speech attacks,” she said. “As with so many other areas where disadvantage undermines health and wellbeing, more work is needed to ensure equal protections and access to the good things the internet can provide. This is especially so as we begin the referendum process to enshrine an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice in the Australian Constitution.” eSafety has also launched new resources in First Nations languages to better support kids online at its website. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said “there is no place in Australia for hate.” “eSafety can help when things go wrong online, and support victims of online abuse. I look forward to seeing how eSafety’s latest resources support First Nations people to stay safe online,” she said. Moira Deeming suspension ‘not off to a good start’: Pesutto Back in Victoria and last night the Liberal leader, John Pesutto, spoke to ABC 7.30 about the Moira Deeming suspension, while at the same time Deeming tweeted that she “never condemned” people Pesutto had told the media she had condemned. It seems a little bit of a mess. Pesutto has responded that the suspension is “not off to a good start” so expect to see more fallout from that today. Anyone bidding for government contracts worth more than $25,000 must show they are tackling modern slavery risks under new legislation to be introduced to the Australian Capital Territory’s parliament. The would also require the ACT’s own government entities to consider and reduce the risk of modern slavery in their own supply chains. Following legislation already in force in New South Wales, the ACT legislation would also create a new anti-slavery commissioner to provide advice and education about how to combat modern slavery. Labor and the Greens - which together hold a majority in the ACT legislative assembly – agreed as part of their governing agreement to ensure territory legislation “can identify and effectively respond to modern day slavery”. Jo Clay, the Greens member who proposed the bill, said the modern slavery category could include forced labour, forced marriage, sexual exploitation or human trafficking. Clay said states and territories had “an essential role to play in addressing this issue both in their own borders and outside of them” because they had significant responsibility for service delivery. Clay said: The ACT government need to lead by example in scrutinising their supply chains for modern slavery risk. We also need to ensure that our response is holistic and that we are looking at the local context. I believe it is important that we take responsibility for what we buy and procure. Currently the commonwealth system only requires large companies with turnover of over $100m to consider these risks. Our changes will ensure that ACT government procurements above $25,000 consider the risk of modern slavery. The move comes at a time when the federal government is reviewing national anti-slavery laws, with the option of tightening the reporting threshold and introducing penalties for breaches. Welcome to day six of the last parliament sitting before the budget is handed down. Having secured much-needed support on the safeguard mechanism, Labor is turning its attention to its housing future fund. It needs the Greens and two crossbench MPs on that one – Lidia Thorpe has committed to voting with the Greens on climate issues, but makes her own decision on others – and so far, a compromise has not been reached. The main issue is that no one seems to think 30,000 homes over five years is particularly impressive, or believes that the fund will work. Labor hasn’t been prepared to budge or go further, so the bill is languishing. Still, there’s three days of hardcore negotiating to go, so who knows what will happen. The count continues in NSW, with Labor waiting to see if it will form majority government. Pre-poll and postal votes matter in quite a few seats, so it’s not a done deal just yet. Our NSW team will keep you updated on the count as it comes through, as well as any decisions on who will lead the NSW opposition. Our Victoria and Queensland teams will also drop in anything you need to know about what’s going on there as well – other than Queensland being the greatest nation on earth, of course. Back federally and we’ll see if Peter Dutton pops his head up today. He was unusually quiet yesterday, not holding a press conference even when the Greens struck a deal on the safeguard mechanism – he left that to Ted O’Brien, which is not a sentence you read often (for good reason, usually). And he didn’t ask any questions during QT. Labor thinks it’s because of this Saturday’s Aston byelection – Dutton isn’t exactly popular in Victoria, so the government think he’s keeping a low profile. Dutton barely campaigned in NSW, but a loss in Aston would be both historic (governments don’t win byelections from opposition, as a general rule) and also throw his leadership into turmoil. So far, any grumbles from the Liberal party room have been fairly muted. But at the same time, the “there’s no one else” reasoning is getting a little harsher. It doesn’t sound like it’s going to be a great vibe in the joint party room meeting today, put it that way. We’ll keep you across all the vibes and all the information as it comes to hand. It’s at least a three coffee morning.

António Guterres, the UN secretary general, warned that recent optimistic assessments were “an illusion”, exhorting leaders to make stronger efforts to cut greenhouse gases. The biggest country to respond was India, the world’s third biggest emitter, which set out a target of net zero by 2070, which most regard as too late for the Cop26 goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels but some said would be met sooner. Joe Biden used his final words to take a swipe at China. The Chinese delegation seemed less perturbed, having its own issues with marshalling smaller developing countries, which are concerned that the 1.5C goal is slipping out of reach. Boris Johnson was alternately hopeful and despairing, and viewed with puzzlement at best and as clownish at worst by the rest of the world, before hopping on a private jet on Tuesday for dinner with the arch-climate denier and former Telegraph editor Charles Moore to discuss the Owen Paterson scandal (and look how that went). Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has been working behind the scenes to stymie progress on ratcheting up ambition on emissions cuts. But by far the biggest flurry of activity in week one came from the UK hosts, who orchestrated a series of major announcements and deals on forests, finance and coal, to keep up a stream of positive news and momentum, buoying the talks while the negotiators worked on the tricky details. One particular missive, sent by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy at 4.14pm on Wednesday but embargoed until 10.30pm that evening, tells the story of the week in microcosm. END OF COAL IN SIGHT AS UK SECURES AMBITIOUS COMMITMENTS AT COP26 SUMMIT “Cash, coal, cars and trees – to keep the world to 1.5C” was the catchy mantra set out earlier this year by Johnson’s spokesperson Allegra Stratton. Coal is a key element of this: the dirtiest fossil fuel, still in widespread use and still expanding in some countries. If coal use continues, the International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol has made clear, the world has no hope of remaining within 1.5C. Taking aim at coal is thus essential to any successful outcome at Cop26. But within the UN process, countries are asked for their own nationally determined contributions (NDCs). In these, their use of particular energy forms can be obscured or not recorded at all. So separating out coal from other sources of energy is a key way for the UK to highlight the problem and set countries on the clean energy track needed. Thanks to a package of support from the UK and our international partners, a 190-strong coalition has today agreed to both phase out coal power and end support for new coal power plants. But here is where the UK runs into trouble. There are just over 190 countries at Cop26. Can all of them be planning to phase out coal? Or is this too good to be true? The UK’s campaign sees major banks commit to end financing coal, on top of China, Japan, Korea and the G20 commitments to end overseas finance for coal generation by the end of 2021, effectively ending all public financing of new unabated coal power. Again, this is a key goal of Cop26 – earlier this year, the G7, under the UK’s presidency, agreed to halt the overseas financing of coal, after stiff opposition from Japan. China later announced that it would follow suit, a major achievement that means all the biggest state financiers of coal in the developing world will stop funding new plants in developing countries. But it does not say anything about these countries setting up new coal plants in their own countries – they can still do so. And it does not say anything about the private sector – banks can still fund coal even if they have signed up the UK government’s other major finance initiative of the week, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), supposedly a $130tn (£96tn) pact by 450 banks to move their portfolios to net zero by 2050. Agreed under the UK’s Cop26 presidency, countries pledge to accelerate coal phase-out and rapidly scale up deployment of clean power generation, marking a momentous turning point in the global clean energy transition. This stream of announcements reflects the approach the UK has taken to Cop26, which has essentially two strands: the tough UN negotiations, which centre on getting countries to come forward with NDCs to reduce emissions and sorting out the complexities of the 2015 Paris agreement; and a series of deals and initiatives that are outside the technical part of the UN process but will provide a means of cutting emissions. These two strands are nothing new – there has been broad acknowledgement for years that not everything needed to cut emissions will be achieved through the UN framework convention on climate change, not least because the cumbersome processin which decisions can only be made by consensus, can easily be halted by unfriendly governments. In the US, Republican administrations with presidents hostile to climate action have been in power for 12 out of the last 22 years, and could soon be again. While Donald Trump was in the White House, withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, initiatives from businesses and “non-state actors”, such as individual US states and cities in the US and around the world, were essential to keeping progress alive. So at Cop26 there has been a broad variety of side deals (though UK officials bridle at the term) including a US-EU led pact to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030, which if successful would reduce warming by 0.2C; an agreement by more than 130 countries to halt deforestation by 2030; and the Glasgow emissions-cutting deals among global businesses involved in cement and steel production, which experts said would be vital to reducing emissions from those hard-to-decarbonise industries. The end of coal – the single biggest contributor to climate change – is in sight thanks to the UK securing a 190-strong coalition of countries and organisations at Cop26, with countries such as Poland, Vietnam, Egypt, Chile and Morocco announcing clear commitments to phase out coal power. That 190-strong coalition again – but this time it is referred to as countries and organisations. And we get a hint that the announcement may be less powerful than it first seemed: Poland and Vietnam are big users of coal, but Egypt, Chile and Morocco are minor users. Egypt, for example, uses just 0.1% of the world’s coal. Today’s commitments, brought together through UK-led efforts including the new ‘Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement’, encompass developed and developing countries, major coal users and climate vulnerable countries. This includes 18 countries committing for the first time to phase out and not build or invest in new coal power, including Poland, Vietnam, and Chile, marking a milestone moment at Cop26 in the global clean energy transition. So here is the actual point: only 18 countries are actually agreeing to phase out coal power, and they do not include 15 of the world’s biggest coal users. This statement, launched today, commits nations across the world to: · End all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally · Rapidly scale up deployment of clean power generation · Phase out coal power in economies in the 2030s for major economies and 2040s for the rest of the world · Make a just transition away from coal power in a way that benefits workers and communities. Take careful note of the dates for phase-out here. The 2030s for major economies is too late – they should be phasing out coal in the next decade for a 1.5C target to be possible. Germany, for instance, is targeting 2038 for its coal phaseout – much too late, experts say. And the 2040s may be just about tenable for some developing countries, but who are developing countries? Well, it turns out that Poland considers itself a developing country, despite being the world’s 21st biggest economy by GDP. And Poland will phase out coal by 2049. Technically, that means it can reach net-zero emissions by 2050. But if all countries did that, the 1.5C target would be well out of reach. That’s because of the “area under the curve”. The climate responds to the accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere. Every year of emissions adds to the stock of carbon. Scientists say we must reach net zero emissions by 2050 to have a a hope of sticking to 1.5C. But unless we also cut emissions in the short term, on the way to 2050, the cumulative emissions up to mid-century – the area under the curve if you plot annual emissions from now to 2050 – could be so high that we bust through the 1.5C target anyway. This is on top of China, Japan and Korea, the three largest public financiers of coal, committing to end overseas finance for coal generation by the end of 2021, announced in the last year during the UK’s incoming Cop26 presidency. Agreements at the G7, G20 and OECD to end public international coal finance send a strong signal that the world economy is shifting to renewables. This could end over 40GW of coal across 20 countries, equivalent to over half of the UK’s electricity generating capacity. The business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said: “Today marks a milestone moment in our global efforts to tackle climate change as nations from all corners of the world unite in Glasgow to declare that coal has no part to play in our future power generation. “Spearheaded by the UK’s Cop26 presidency, today’s ambitious commitments made by our international partners demonstrate that the end of coal is in sight. The world is moving in the right direction, standing ready to seal coal’s fate and embrace the environmental and economic benefits of building a future that is powered by clean energy. “To meet the goals of the Paris agreement to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, the global transition to clean power needs to progress four to six times faster than at present. With coal being the single largest contributor to climate change, phasing it out and delivering a rapid, inclusive transition to clean energy is essential if we are to keep 1.5 degrees alive. “28 new members have today signed up to the world’s largest alliance on phasing out coal, the Powering Past Coal Alliance launched and co-chaired by the UK. Chile, Singapore and Durban have today joined over 150 countries, subnationals and businesses, including finance partners NatWest, Lloyds Banking, HSBC and Export Development Canada. This accounts for over $17tn assets now committed to PPCA coal phase out goals.” The Powering Past Coal Alliance, set up in 2017 by the UK and Canada, has been heavily criticised by NGOs for the weakness of its rules, which allow countries huge latitude in continuing to use coal. HSBC has also come under fire at Cop26 for having poured $15.2bn into coal from 2018 to 2020. Patrick McCully, senior analyst at the campaign group Reclaim Finance, said: “We do need to make coal history, and fast. But sadly, this new coalition replicates the failings of the Powering Past Coal Alliance. Put bluntly, the PPCA doesn’t do what it says on the tin, given that its global coal exit date of 2050 comes 10 years too late [and] the question of coal mining is simply omitted.” There has also been a 76% cut in the number of new coal plants planned globally over the last six years, which means the cancellation of 1,000GW of new coal plants since the Paris agreement, roughly equivalent to 10 times the UK’s total peak generating capacity. Today’s global agreement to move away from coal to clean power has been made possible thanks to a number of other UK-convened initiatives, including: · No new coal power: The end of new coal power construction is in sight. The launch of the No New Coal Power compact by six countries at the UN high level dialogue in September was followed by the commitments in the Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement. This means that by the end of this year, all new public finance for unabated coal power plants will have stopped, with investments increasingly focused instead on accelerating the transition to clean energy sources such as wind and solar power, now cheaper than coal generation in most countries. This accelerates the growing global momentum to end new coal power, demonstrated by the 76% collapse in the global pipeline of proposed coal power plants since the Paris agreement in 2015. · Supporting emerging economies: In addition, major emerging economies have announced plans to accelerate a just transition from coal to clean power. This includes a South Africa Just Energy Transition Partnership worth $8.5bn, as well as Indonesia and the Philippines agreeing a ground-breaking new partnership with the Asian Development Bank to support the early retirement of existing coal plants. Further financing announcements are expected today at Cop26. · Supporting coal-intensive economies: Countries with significant coal power generation and mining face large social and financial challenges in the transition from coal. The UK’s Cop26 energy transition council (ETC) mobilises and coordinates the assistance required to enable coal intensive economies to equitably transition from coal, bringing together 20 governments and over 15 international institutions to accelerate the transition from coal to clean power as part of a green economic recovery. For example, the energy transition council’s rapid response facility delivers fast-acting technical, regulatory and commercial assistance to countries and has already responded to 24 requests in a range of areas, including energy efficiency in the Philippines and grid management in Egypt. · Ensuring a just transition: Today the UK government has also launched a new International Just Transition Declaration, ensuring the move away from coal-high carbon industries results in a sustainable, green and fair future, and one that creates high-quality new jobs and champions local social dialogue in developing and emerging economies. Coordinated by the UK government, so far, 12 countries have signed, as well as the UK and EU Commission, covering a broad spectrum of the world’s donor funding, now driving towards a just transition for communities around the world. The UK’s announcements on coal came very late in the day for newspaper deadlines, so there was little time for fact-checking. That meant some media reported on them, only to have to backtrack later – leading to suggestions that the deals were flawed or contained loopholes. Some queries submitted by the Guardian, asking for the full list of countries involved and what exactly they were signing up to, were only answered at 7pm, which is close to our first print deadlines. Further queries were answered at 10pm, just before the embargoed story could go live online, and at 5am the next day there were still more clarifications. Some of this mess is inevitable because at a live and busy conference some countries will only ever sign up at the last minute, and the UK cannot be faulted for trying to get as many on board as possible. But it also means that if anything is unclear in the announcement, accusations of flaws and backtracking will inevitably follow. It also shows the difficulty for the UK of coordinating its Cop26 strategy across government – these announcements came from BEIS, but the Cop26 unit is the one leading in Glasgow. The coal announcements were not the only controversial news last week. The UK’s forestry announcement, of 130 countries agreeing to halt deforestation, was also criticised when Indonesia appeared to deny that it intended to enforce the goal, and critics pointed out that previous forestry agreements had failed to deliver. The GFANZ alliance was also criticised for allowing the 450 participating financial institutions – which the UK announcement noted had a combined value of $130tn but failed to note were only likely to use a small slice of that for green ends in the short term – to carry on investing in fossil fuels. Mohamed Adow, director of the Nairobi-based thinktank Power Shift Africa, summed up the frustration of many: “This week has seen a blitz of announcements from the UK [that] may generate headlines, but assessing their true worth is hugely difficult, especially at speed during a Cop meeting. Boris Johnson has been criticised ‘for government by press release’, and it now seems to extend to their management of a UN climate summit. These announcements are eye candy, but the sugar rush they provide are empty calories.” The UK’s first week as Cop26 president – although the government has been preparing for this moment for more than two years – has been lively and has marked important progress as well as some reversals and rows. The second week, when negotiators have to come up with the full text of an agreement, will be much harder. But despite the difficulties above, the problems over queueing and access to negotiating rooms, most countries spoken to by the Guardian have felt that the UK was doing a creditable job. Whether that will still be the case by next weekend will depend on the UK resolving key outstanding elements: provisions in the Paris agreement governing how countries account for their emissions; whether carbon trading should play a role in helping countries meet their emissions targets; whether countries should have to return to the negotiating table every year with better NDCs if their current plans are inadequate; and above all, persuading countries that limiting global heating to 1.5C is still genuinely possible, rather than an illusion or “hypothesis”. A Cop26 spokesperson said: “We’ve seen genuine progress in the first week with a number of commitments that are key to accelerating global climate action and keeping 1.5 alive. “We’re looking forward to productive negotiations this week to push hard and make further progress for a positive outcome for the planet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/jul/13/offshore-wind-energy-investment-quadruples-despite-covid-19-slump","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-13T16:35:00Z","webTitle":"Offshore wind energy investment quadruples despite Covid-19 slump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/13/offshore-wind-energy-investment-quadruples-despite-covid-19-slump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/jul/13/offshore-wind-energy-investment-quadruples-despite-covid-19-slump","fields":{"headline":"Offshore wind energy investment quadruples despite Covid-19 slump","bodyText":"Global offshore wind investment more than quadrupled in the first half of the year even as the coronavirus pandemic triggered an unprecedented economic shock. A report has found that investors gave the greenlight to 28 new offshore windfarms worth a total of $35bn (£28bn) this year, four times more than in the first half of 2019 and well above the total for last year as a whole. The biggest half-year tally for offshore wind investment more than made up for a slowdown in investment for onshore wind and solar farm projects after the outbreak of Covid-19, according to the report by Bloomberg NEF (BNEF). Albert Cheung, BNEF’s head of analysis, said: “We expected to see Covid-19 affecting renewable energy investment in the first half, via delays in the financing process and to some auction programmes. There are signs of that in both solar and onshore wind, but the overall global figure has proved amazingly resilient – thanks to offshore wind.” The sea-based windfarms include some of the biggest investments in offshore wind ever made. The Hollandse Kust Zuid array off the coast of the Netherlands will cost the Swedish energy giant Vattenfall $3.9bn, and SSE’s Seagreen project in Scotland’s Firth of Forth is valued at $3.8bn. The number of offshore wind projects to receive a greenlight in China climbed to 17 in the first half of the year, led by the Guangdong Yudean Group’s $1.8bn plans to build the Yangjiang Yangxi Shapaat wind power project. BNEF believes offshore wind projects are taking off despite the global economic gloom in part due to a two-thirds fall in cost since 2012 and a rush in China to finance and build offshore wind projects before the government’s subsidy regime expires at the end of 2021. The growth in offshore wind powered a 5% jump in total renewable energy investment to $132.4bn despite a slump for onshore wind and solar power projects. Onshore wind investment for the first half of the year fell by a fifth to $37.5bn, while solar investment slipped 12% to $54.7bn. China remained the world’s biggest market for renewable energy, with total investment of $41.6bn in the first half of the year, up more than 40% from the same period last year thanks to its offshore wind boom. In Europe, renewable energy investment reached $36.5bn, up by 50%, while the UK’s renewable energy investment climbed to $5.7bn, more than three and half times greater than the total investment in early 2019. Renewable energy investment slipped by 30% in the US to $17.8bn while India and Brazil recorded investments which were about 50% and 25% lower respectively at $2.7bn and $2.5bn. Renewable energy is expected to be the most resilient area of the energy industry this year after the International Energy Agency warned that investment in global energy would fall by $400bn, the biggest slump in the industry’s history. Angus McCrone, the chief editor of BNEF, said that a clearer picture of the impact of Covid-19 on green energy investment will come with the full-year 2020 figures. “Renewables have been helped by vastly improved competitiveness and by investor appetite for assets offering secure cash flows. However, project developers face the challenge that key people, whether at the permitting, financing or construction stages, can’t meet face-to-face. And buyers of small-scale solar systems are sensitive to changes in consumer confidence.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/may/26/australia-news-live-sydney-fire-school-shooting-perth-politics-labor-greens-coalition-melbourne-sydney-indigenous-voice-","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-26T08:06:36Z","webTitle":"News live: nurses union fined $350,000 for West Australian strike; Rex Patrick loses FOI challenge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/may/26/australia-news-live-sydney-fire-school-shooting-perth-politics-labor-greens-coalition-melbourne-sydney-indigenous-voice-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/may/26/australia-news-live-sydney-fire-school-shooting-perth-politics-labor-greens-coalition-melbourne-sydney-indigenous-voice-","fields":{"headline":"News live: nurses union fined $350,000 for West Australian strike; Rex Patrick loses FOI challenge","bodyText":"A coalition of human rights groups and academic organisations have called for the Albanese to act after a review of the Modern Slavery Act found it had not made “meaningful change” during its first three years of operation. The review, led by Professor John McMillan, made 30 recommendations to strengthen the existing act. Freya Dinshaw, Acting Legal Director at the Human Rights Law Centre said the Act “needs to be strengthened in order to ensure that no Australian companies are profiting from exploitation”. While we would have liked to see the review go even further and recommend an enforceable duty on companies to prevent modern slavery, its recommendations, if implemented, will substantially strengthen the current law. The coalition of organisations are calling on the Albanese Government to implement these recommendations and ensure that the newly announced establishment of an independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner be adequately resourced to provide effective oversight of the Act. Andrew Forrest congratulates Mike Cannon-Brookes on Sun Cable project Andrew Forrest has congratulated Mike Cannon-Brookes on winning out in the bidding war for the future of the Sun Cable project saying “any project that takes the world closer to real zero is positive for the planet.” Here is the full statement: While Squadron Energy did not participate in the final binding bid process for Sun Cable, we are delighted that other investors like Grok are playing a role in tackling global warming, by replacing fossil fuel investment with green energy projects. Squadron decided the capital allocation did not align with Squadron’s strategic goals, as we are already working to deliver 30% of the renewable energy required to meet the Federal Government’s target of 82% renewables by 2030 and want to bring new green electrons into the grid as soon as possible. We have decided to focus on the existing 20GW pipeline of assets as a much faster way to achieve those goals and take Australia closer to a carbon-free future. We remain unconvinced of the commercial viability of the Australia-Asia Powerlink but if others believe it can be achieved, we wish them all the best. As an interested shareholder we look forward to better understanding the details of the deal. Part of National Museum collection contaminated by silica The National Museum of Australia in Canberra is working to remove deadly silica dust that has contaminated part of the national historical collection. Museum deputy director Ruth Wilson told a Senate estimates hearing late on Thursday the items have been kept in a storage facility next to a concrete factory and the resulting contamination meant staff were banned from entering the site for much of 2022. There’s a buildup of silica dust in the facility, which requires removal before any collection can be treated. In April, the federal government announced a $78.3 million funding boost for the institution over the next four years. That included $13.1m to lease an “urgently needed” new storage facility and move the items from their current site. The objects include machinery, agricultural equipment, boats, trucks and planes, all of which the museum regards as “relatively robust”. The institution leased the premises in 1988 when there were no other buildings nearby, but it won’t reveal the location of the contaminated site. - AAP PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the consultancy firm at the centre of a tax scandal, has contracts with the company that runs key defence shipbuilding infrastructure. Australian Naval Infrastructure (ANI) confirmed in Senate estimates today that it has two contracts with PwC, which used confidential government tax information to help companies minimise their tax payments. Greens senator David Shoebridge asked ANI chief, Andrew Seaton, about the contracts with PwC, whom he described as “unable to protect the secrets of the Australian people” and “deeply unethical in wanting to sell those secrets”. Seaton said one contract was for tax advice, and the other was for “charging mechanisms for infrastructure assets”. He said he had spoken to PwC, would continue reviewing their involvement, and that ANI had not given PwC any information about infrastructure for the nuclear-powered submarines. I agree with you that PwC’s behaviour, which has recently come to light, doesn’t align with the values of ANI or businesses that we choose to deal with. An $85 million testing facility, built for the cancelled French submarines, is now being demolished. Some of the scrap steel from the platform land-based test facility in Adelaide will be sold. Greens senator David Shoebridge questioned the Australian Naval Infrastructure chief, Andrew Seaton, in senate estimates this morning. He asked about work ANI was doing to prepare for the nuclear-powered Aukus submarines, which former prime minister Scott Morrison picked to replace the French version, and whether they should be charging ahead with plans for “a nuclear submarine that’s not more than a thought bubble”: Don’t you think the Albanese government should learn from the disastrous mess the Morrison government produced? Finance minister Katy Gallagher said it was “unfair to blame” ANI for a government decision. Scott Morrison – former prime minister, minister for health, finance, home affairs, treasurer … author? Former PM Scott Morrison appears to be on the verge of publishing a book with an American publisher of Christian titles. Morrison declared on his register of interests a “royalties advance” from Harper Collins Christian Publishing. The declaration, uploaded to the parliament’s website today, does not give any further information on what the royalties advance is for. We’ve asked Morrison’s office and Harper Collins for comment. Morrison’s stewardship of the country through the COVID period has already been the subject of a book, Plagued, which drew on extensive interviews with the former Coalition leader. The book revealed Morrison’s secret appointments to the health and finance departments through the pandemic, with that list later expanding to the departments of industry, treasury, and home affairs. Morrison has been widely tipped to resign as member for Cook before the next election. Home Affairs refuses to release report on risks of social media apps The Home Affairs Department is refusing to release a report outlining the risks of social media apps on government devices, arguing the report contains information provided by an Australian intelligence agency. The report was provided to the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, in March, and led to the government banning TikTok from all government-owned devices, amid concern that the company’s links to China would mean the Chinese national security law could see data handed over to the Chinese government. This is something TikTok has long denied could happen. The report was commissioned to cover a wide array of apps, not just TikTok, but has not been released publicly. The Home Affairs Department on Friday refused a freedom of information request from Guardian Australia for the report, saying it contains information prepared by an intelligence agency exempt from the FOI Act. The decision doesn’t name the agency, but the list includes Asio, IGIS, the ONI and Australian Signals Directorate. Greens senator David Shoebridge has also called for the government to provide the report to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs senate committee as part of the Senate estimates process this week. The department secretary, Mike Pezzullo, said on Monday he would need to seek the approval of the minister before providing it. ‘Ball is in government’s court’ on FOI delays Grata Fund, which financially supported the former senator Rex Patrick’s freedom of information case, has also responded to the ruling. Grata Fund’s executive director, Isabelle Reinecke, said the decision “should be an enormous catalyst for the government to improve and future-proof the FOI system” by funding the office of the Australian information commissioner adequately: By anyone’s measure, multiple year delays are unacceptable, and now the ball is in the government’s court to ensure its public commitments to the democratic operation of government are put into effect. David Shoebridge calls on government to properly fund office of Australian information commissioner Move comes after a federal court judge noted the agency had “an unquestionable shortage of resources”. Shoebridge, who is the party’s justice spokesperson, said the public should care about the issue because “democracies only work when the public has the information needed to hold governments to account”. Shoebridge said Australia’s “broken” freedom of information (FOI) system was “making that close to impossible”. As reported here earlier this afternoon, the former independent senator Rex Patrick lost his legal challenge against what he argued were unreasonable delays in the commissioner’s reviews of FOI matters. Justice Michael Wheelahan found that a claim of unreasonable delays “must take account of the resources that are available to the commissioner and the competing demands on those resources”. He found “the combined force of the evidence pointed to an unquestionable shortage of resources” but “whether that situation is acceptable is not a question for the court to decide”. Shoebridge told Guardian Australia this afternoon: The parliament has given the commission statutory functions but the government is starving it of the funds to fulfil them. This must be a loud wake-up call to the attorney general given all the promises he made on transparency before the election. Rally against SA’s anti-protest laws to be held outside parliament on Friday evening The controversial amendments are expected to come to a vote as early as Tuesday. Amnesty International spokeswoman Adelaide Xerri said the bill’s broad scope was concerning. This crackdown on the right to protest means all our ability to fight for human rights and combat the climate crisis are under threat. People must not face huge fines, and even prison sentences, just for standing up for what’s right. Unions have also condemned the increased penalties, along with Greens MPs in the upper house. On Friday, the Law Society of South Australia posed a series of questions and said it was “deeply troubling” that those in favour of the higher fines had not explained the rationale for the changes or the urgency for their introduction. The organisation also questioned why there was no public consultation. - with AAP The host of Q+A stood down from the show on Monday after receiving “grotesque racist abuse” which escalated after he spoke on the ABC about the impact of colonialism ahead of the king’s coronation. Grant told the Sydney Writers’ festival that the ABC panel discussing the impact of the monarchy on Indigenous people was a “respectful” conversation that was misconstrued by some media commentators as a “hate-filled hour of television”. If a white person had been on air talking about historical realities like martial law and the extermination of the Wiradjuri people they “would not have been abused the way I was”, Grant said. Race crowded out everything. It wasn’t just what I was saying, it was the fact that I was saying it. And the racial attacks and abuse began before I had even uttered a word. Grant was talking to constitutional lawyer George Williams at a session about his book The White Queen is Dead, about the bitter legacy of colonialism for Indigenous people. Nurses union fined $350,000 for West Australian strike The nurses union has copped a $350,000 fine for organising a strike during which thousands of Western Australian health workers fought for better pay and conditions. About 3,000 nurses and midwives walked off the job at hospitals across the state on 25 November last year after the Australian Nursing Federation ignored a lawful direction from the WA Industrial Relations Commission to call off the action. The commission on Friday handed down its written judgement, in which chief commissioner Stephen Kenner labelled the union’s correspondence before the strike “staggering”, “belligerent noncompliance” and “dripping with contempt”. In breach of the no-strike order, at least 1,758 members of the ANF employed in the public health system took industrial action by walking off the job or failing to report for duty. The industrial action included various rallies throughout the state including at Parliament House and Dumas House in Perth, and in Albany, Broome, Bunbury, Geraldton, and Karratha. Following a negotiation during the hearing, the commission fined the union the agreed amount of $350,000. - AAP The former independent senator Rex Patrick has lost his legal challenge against what he argued were unreasonable delays in the freedom of information (FOI) system. But the federal court judgment, published today, also says the “picture that is painted by the evidence is that the Australian information commissioner has limited resources” to perform the volume of matters before her. The federal court action was initiated in 2021 by Patrick. The then senator for South Australia had argued his right to access government documents had been “frustrated by delays” by the information commissioner in deciding on his applications that challenged department’s FOI decisions. Justice Michael Wheelahan found that a claim of unreasonable delays “must take account of the resources that are available to the commissioner and the competing demands on those resources”. In one of the reviews at the heart of the case, he said the delay was “very significant indeed” but he was “not satisfied that there has been unreasonable delay” according to law: It is ultimately for the commonwealth parliament to legislate so as to appropriate monies to the Office of the Australian information commissioner in order to enable the discharge of the commissioner’s statutory functions. Any legislative decision no doubt needs to balance competing budgetary demands, which are for the parliament to consider. Patrick told Guardian Australia: While I’m naturally disappointed with the outcome, ultimately the court found that it is for the commonwealth parliament to fix the problem, not the court. The parliament needs to pay attention to this judgment. In effect the court found that the time taken by the information commissioner is not legally unreasonable on account of the commissioner’s lack of resources. Mike Cannon-Brookes has prevailed over Andrew Forrest in a billionaires’ battle for control of Sun Cable, an ambitious development promised to transmit solar power from the Northern Territory outback to Singapore. Cannon-Brookes and Forrest had been involved in a five-month bidding process to gain control of the $35bn project after they fell out over its future direction and the company went into voluntary administration. FTI, the administrators of Sun Cable, have announced that a consortium led by Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures had been successful in acquiring the company’s assets. In a statement, the consortium said it believed Sun Cable “had the potential to be a nation-building project for Australia”. We believe Sun Cable can achieve long-term success by delivering globally competitive electrons to Australia and the world. We will continue to pursue customer off-take agreements in Singapore and Darwin, and collaborate with the Singaporean and Northern Territory governments to achieve this mission. It said the consortium would “deep dive with management over the coming weeks” before saying more about the project’s design and development. Cannon-Brookes said it was “a big step in the right direction”. We’ve always believed in the possibilities Sun Cable presents in exporting our boundless sunshine, and what it could mean for Australia. It’s time to stretch our country’s ambition. We need to take big swings if we are going to be a renewable energy superpower. So swing we will. More to come at Guardian Australia shortly. South Australian coroner finds death of five-year-old was preventable The death of a young boy with special needs, who choked on a nectarine stone while at school, would have been prevented had he been better supervised, an inquest has found. Five-year-old Lucas Latouche Mazzei died in March 2017 after choking on the stone at Adelaide’s Henley Beach Primary School. Deputy State Coroner Ian White said Lucas was left unsupervised for an unacceptable period of time. He ruled that had staff remained in the classroom during the whole time the boy was watching the cartoon, his death would have been prevented. The coroner said Lucas’ death was “heartbreaking and tragic” and the distressing attempt to save his life had a marked effect on those involved. Lucas’ parents have been consumed by grief over the death of their precious little son that day. White found that, under the circumstances, the efforts to save the boy were reasonable. But he recommended all teaching staff be required to hold up-to-date qualifications in providing first aid assistance in an education and care setting. He also called for the education department to review its policies on obtaining information about students with special needs and review the first-aid guidelines for dealing with a choking emergency. Outside the court on Friday, Lucas’ mother Daniela Mazzei said the journey looking for answers about her son’s death had been “extremely hurtful, even cruel”. Lucas’ death did not receive the attention it deserved from the education department, even when we insisted on it. Our grief will always be with us. His death could have been prevented. - AAP US doesn’t want to drag Pacific allies into “headlong” clash with China Joe Biden’s senior advisers have acknowledged countries in the Indo-Pacific don’t want to be “trampled by a headlong clash” between the US and China. In a webinar with an Australian audience on Friday, senior White House national security council (NSC) officials said the US president wanted to give allies and other close partners “breathing space” to engage with China constructively. Edgard Kagan, the NSC’s senior director for east Asia and Oceania, said Biden had been listening to the region’s concerns. “I think the president is very focused on the fact that we cannot strengthen our relations with allies and partners if we just try and jam our views down their throat,” Kagan said. “That’s not who he is.” For more on this story, read the full report by Guardian Australia’s foreign affairs and defence reporter Daniel Hurst. WA to keep ‘no grounds evictions’ Western Australia will keep provisions that allow landlords to evict tenants without providing a reason in newly announced changes to the Residential Tenancies Act, despite its department advising they be removed. The decision to keep “no grounds evictions” overrules explicit advice from the Department of Mines, Industry Regulations and Safety that recommended the government introduce a list of grounds for termination of a lease by landlords: The review recommended that the [Residential Tenancies ACT] be amended to prohibit without grounds terminations by lessors and introduce additional grounds for termination. In a joint press release on Friday, Minister for Finance, Commerce and Women’s Interest Sue Ellery and Minister for Housing, Lands and Homeless John Carey said “major changes” to the act would strike the right balance between tenants and landlords. But they said “the McGowan government is not making any chances to the ‘without grounds’ terminations provisions”. This means the current provisions of 60 days notice for periodic leases and 30 days notice for fixed remain in place. Changes to the Act will include: a ban on rent bidding, with landlords and property managers unable to pressure or encourage tenants to offer more than the advertised rent; reducing the frequency of rent increases to once every 12 months; tenants will be allowed to keep a pet or pets in a rental premises in most cases; tenants will be able to make certain minor modifications to the rental premises and the landlord will only be able to refuse consent on certain grounds; the release of security bonds at the end of a tenancy will be streamlined, allowing tenants and landlords to apply separately regarding how bond payments are to be disbursed; and disputes over bond payments, as well as disagreements about pets and minor modifications, will be referred to the commissioner for consumer protection for determination. The changes will also mean rents must be advertised as a fixed amount and not as a range, however tenants who make minor changes to their rental property “may be required” to restore it to its original condition at the end of the tenancy. Ellery said banning rental auctions and reducing rent increases would “help ease the financial burden on many families”. The new laws proposed by the McGowan government strike a good balance by protecting the owner’s investment property while providing stability and certainty for tenants. Carey said the changes “strike the balance between the rights and needs of tenants and landlords.” Our focus is on boosting the supply of housing, which is why we’re investing a record $2.6 billion in housing, lands and homelessness measures throughout Western Australia. Senator Lidia Thorpe will seek to amend the constitutional alteration to establish the Indigenous voice, to include an explicit acknowledgement of the sovereignty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The bill is still in the House of Representatives, and won’t hit the Senate until at least next week, but the former Greens senator (now independent) has given notice she will introduce an amendment to the alteration. Thorpe, a noted voice critic, hasn’t flagged changes to strengthen the body or give it new powers – but instead to add a whole extra section to the constitution. The voice, as proposed, would be established in a new section 129 at the end of the constitution (which currently has 128 sections). Thorpe’s amendment would insert another section, 130, titled: “Sovereignty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples”. Thorpe wants that section of the constitution to include the line “Nothing in this Act shall be taken to cede or disturb the Sovereignty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.” Her amendment goes on to suggest adding the lines: The Sovereignty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples means an unceded right held in collective possession by the members of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nations which confers usage, access and custodianship to the lands, waters, minerals and natural resources of what is now known as Australia, and the right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to exercise an unimpeded and collective self-determinate governance over their political, economic and social affairs. Thorpe has long spoken of scepticism about the voice and quit the Greens partly over the party’s commitment to support the voice. But she told Guardian Australia this week she had “not stated any position on how people should vote in the proposed referendum.” Prime minister Anthony Albanese yesterday all but ruled out accepting any amendments to the constitutional alteration, telling parliament: This form of words is legally sound, and should be the words that goes forward. Fire and Rescue NSW has released new aerial photos showing the extent of damage in the Sydney building fire. Thanks for following along the news blog this Friday. You’ll be in the excellent hands of Royce Kurmelovs for the rest of the afternoon. Have a lovely weekend! Consumer lender Latitude Financial will suffer a fall in full year cash profit of up to 90%, as hefty costs linked to a massive cyber attack weigh on its financials. In a market update on Friday, Latitude disclosed that it would recognise remediation costs of around $50m after suffering what is the largest-known data breach of an Australian financial institution. The money would be used by customers to replace stolen documents and identification, such as a passport or driver’s licence. The company said: This provision is made up largely of remediation costs but does not include the potential for regulatory fines, class actions, future system enhancements or an assumption of insurance proceeds. The personal information of 7.9m customers was stolen in the March attack, Latitude said. This included driver licence numbers and personal details such as phone numbers, addresses and income and expense information used to assess loan applications. A further 6.1m customers had partial records compromised. The remediation costs, along with disruptions to the business and worsening financial conditions, have combined to severely dent the lender’s profitability. The company said: While Latitude was able to continue processing transactions as it responded to the March cyber-attack, new account originations and collections were closed or severely restricted for a period of approximately five weeks. Shares in Latitude, which offers personal loans and credit to customers at stores including JB Hi-Fi, The Good Guys and Harvey Norman, plunged on Friday after the update, falling more than 5%. The consumer lender now expects to post a full year cash profit in 2023 of between $15m to $25m, compared to $153.5m in 2022. Sewer rats and data security? We’ve been running through the Senate estimates transcripts as they have been going up and we’ve found this interesting exchange between the Greens senator David Shoebridge and the secretary of the home affairs department, Mike Pezzullo. Shoebridge: Sewer rats don’t normally have good data security though, do they? Pezzullo: Well, they might well have very good data security, depending on what they do with the cheese that they’ve taken through the pipes, I suppose! The context for this is last week, the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant told Guardian Australia that since Elon Musk had taken over Twitter, the platform had become toxic, with the “sewer rats” let back on the site. Shoebridge had been questioning Pezzullo about whether he had similar concerns about Twitter as the department has had for TikTok. Pezzullo said that Twitter’s moderation policies are more eSafety’s area rather than Home Affairs – which is more concerned with where a site’s data is hosted, and who might have access to it. Pezzullo did say he saw Inman Grant’s comments, saying he suspected “you [Shoebridge] and I read it in the same place.” Nice to see you’re an avid Guardian reader, secretary. Consumers warned high price of fresh food here to stay The high price of fresh fruit and vegetables won’t come down anytime soon according to fresh food suppliers, AAP reports. Speaking at a food security inquiry, Claire McClelland from the Australian Fresh Produce Alliance said continuing high inputs for producers was keeping prices high: Once a price is up it very rarely goes back down ... once the price of fuel, or packaging or energy is up we very rarely can reduce that cost. Ongoing labour shortages and supply chain challenges were also keeping the price of produce high. Buttrose unaware of Stan Grant abuse until ‘fairly late in the piece’ Asked about the change that needs to come from within the ABC, Buttrose says: There is an inquiry going on. Our audience research shows us that 75% of people think that our content reflects the diversity of Australia. But I think what management needs to do is make sure that we support the people who make that content when they are subject to racist behaviour. It’s unacceptable. It’s unacceptable. And I’m appalled at what Stan went through. And if I’d known earlier, I would have spoken to see him about it. But I didn’t know and I don’t think many of us knew until fairly late in the piece. So I think it’s very important that we that we provide that support to Stan that I said and that everybody reflects about social media. Is this the sort of world we want to live in? It’s unacceptable. ‘We hope he will return’ Buttrose says she hopes Grant will return to ABC programs: We are providing Stan with as much support as we possibly can – and … to his family – and we hope that he will return to our programs as soon as he feels ready to return. It’s up to Stan. I think he has taken six to eight weeks off, and I understand that but I hold Stan in high regard like so many of our listeners do. Buttrose says there is “a lesson for the entire community by Stan Grant stepping back”, calling for a return to civility in public life. I think the strong public reaction has led to what I would call one of the most widespread outpouring of public commentary on public life that we’ve seen for a long time. I think it’s telling me that people are sick of the abusive and toxic culture that pervades our public discourse, whether it’s sport, social issues, politics. We are sadly living in a time actually when people think it’s okay to abuse others with whom they disagree. We can’t have a proper discussion in Australia anymore. And I think Australians want to return to civility in public life. And I think … we need to reflect on this, on the abhorrent and unacceptable behaviour that crops up on social media and lead the way to return to civility in public debate. You can disagree with someone without having to abuse them. And that’s the important lesson from Stan and I know from the many emails I’ve received that Stan is held in very high regard by so many people. ABC’s Ita Buttrose to speak on Stan Grant issue Ita Buttrose, the chair of the ABC, is speaking with ABC Radio Melbourne ahead of an exhibition opening tomorrow celebrating 90 years of the Australian Women’s Weekly. Buttrose started out her career as a copygirl at the Weekly before becoming at age 33 the youngest person to be named editor of the publication. She’s being asked now about her current role and what she’s learned from Stan Grant standing down. At the beginning of the week, ABC news chief Justin Stevens says he regrets not defending Stan Grant earlier as the Q+A host faced racist attacks on social media fuelled by what he described as a “relentless campaign” against the ABC’s coronation broadcast from News Corp. NSW central coast lashed by wild weather There have been incredible hail storms on New South Wales’ central and Hunter coast within the last hour. Senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology Angus Hines says the hail has been generated by thunderstorms along the Hunter Coast north of Sydney: We’ve got a front moving northwards through that area and along that front, we’ve seen some pretty big thunderstorms develop in these thunderstorms generating some large hail for those coastal areas. Public has a $13bn right to know details of Murray Darling Basin plan Tony Grant also took issue with the lack of transparency around how the $13bn Murray-Darling Basin plan is being managed: He said he had conducted a transparency review to determine if an Australian taxpayer would be able to work out - from publicly available information - how much of the money had been spent or committed, and how much was left. The key observation arising from my review was that there is no simple, definitive, public source of information that clearly shows the breakdown of the $13bn figure. He said transparency was vital if taxpayers were to have confidence in the plan: Quite often, with programs of this size and complexity, funding is reprofiled and moved into and out of various program areas, various departments and agencies. Varying amounts – $10bn to $13bn to $15bn – have been quoted as expenditure on Basin reform with no clarity on what elements of the reform package this money has been allocated to. And I can understand why the community and senators must be confused at times, and therefore seek answers to many legitimate questions. The Australian public, in my view, has a $13bn right to know. – AAP The independent inspector general of water compliance has told senators during a budget estimates hearing that Australia’s water laws have “more get out of jail clauses, and opportunities, than a Monopoly board”. Tony Grant said his team had 21 open investigations but had closed 62 since February. The reason they have closed is that the legislation is rubbish. It’s legislation that needs review ... it’s my strong intent to be articulating that in very clear detail for policy makers and legislators to consider. Grant took particular issue with governance issues around price reporting. You’d have to be a moron to get caught on doing anything wrong under that legislation. Grant was asked by Nationals senator Ross Cadel how many people his team had caught. None. There’s too many get-out-of-jail escape clauses in the entire structure of the Basin plan legislation, water acts et cetera, that we feel doesn’t have any enforceability connections. If there’s nothing to enforce you to do the right thing or follow the law, why would you follow the law? – AAP The humpback whale continues its annual migration northwards along Australia’s east coast, with Guardian writer Jennifer King spotting one at Byron Bay’s lighthouse. These earlybird whales are likely juveniles racing ahead of the pack in the procession from their summer feeding grounds in Antartica to the warmer waters of the Great Barrier Reef. The pregnant mothers often leave later to ensure they eat as much as they can before the journey. You can read more about how best to spot them yourself here: Of the voice – and parking tickets It’s five months until the referendum, and it’s claims of misinformation at ten paces, with Labor and Liberal politicians accusing each other of spreading mistruths about the Indigenous voice. Shadow attorney general Michaelia Cash has alleged prime minister Anthony Albanese is “not being honest” about the voice, following a radio interview this morning. Albanese told Cairns 4CA radio: All that the constitutional change will do is recognise Australia’s first peoples – that’s just a matter of respect. But Cash took offence at the description, claiming in a statement “it was misleading to portray the change as simply recognition in the constitution”: The prime minister is spreading misinformation. It is not true that all it does is recognition. If that was true why does there need to be a constitutional right to make representations about everything from submarines to parking tickets? But Cash’s statement leaves out the fact that, in Albanese’s answer (before saying it was about recognition) he specifically outlined key functions of the voice, saying: It won’t have a right of veto over any of the parliament’s decision making, it won’t be a funding body, it won’t run programs. It simply is an opportunity that we have to create a body that will be able to speak to the parliament. Yesterday, of course, Albanese himself accused opposition leader Peter Dutton of spreading misinformation about the voice – and specifically rubbished claims it would weigh in on the matters Cash alleged. Albanese told parliament: Do you think you would spend a single second thinking about public holidays, or parking tickets, or any of the other nonsense the no campaign go on about? If you’re wondering what the scene looks like today, Emily Kowal from the Telegraph shared this video from a nearby rooftop: ‘A happy bride, I imagine’ Amid the fire’s devastation, Fewtrell shares the good news story that firefighters have helped save one soon-to-be-married evacuee’s big day. He describes the coordinated effort with police to rescue pets, medication and a wedding dress: We started to get information for people who needed medication, who needed pets and so forth retrieved. We even had one lady who was due to have a wedding in Hobart and firefighters were able to go and get her wedding dress. That is a happy bride, I would imagine. ‘Perfect set of conditions’ for an intense blaze Fewtrell: We have a building that is well over 100 years old. You have all the dry, very seasoned timber that is in that. It is all stacked up as part of the framework of the building, the floors, staircases and so forth, enabling the fire to spread quickly vertically and that is what we saw played out. The perfect set of conditions to have a very intense fire. A ‘once in a decade’ fire This is a once in a decade type of fire. It is a really defining point for all of the firefighters that attended that in their careers. We had a mixture of experienced firefighters and new firefighters. The one thing I can guarantee is, at the end of their careers, this will be one of the highlights that they reflect on. Up to four buildings directly affected by fire Acting police commissioner Fewtrell says up to four buildings close by have been directly impacted by the fire: At a rough count, there is about three or four very-close-by buildings that have been directly impacted. The buildings that we evacuated at the time. Some of those had fire starting to extend into them, so the radiant heat or embers that are coming from the building started to set small fires on those adjacent buildings. Firefighters were able to extinguish all of those and stop them from spreading into the different units. Fewtrell says two buildings were evacuated. Dunstan says up to 15 people were sleeping rough in the building the night before the fire and police have confirmed 13 are safe and well. Police are searching “furiously” to locate two other people. We are aware that building has been vacant for approximately 12 months. Some deconstruction work has been taking place. We are aware that some people from time to time sleep rough at that location and young people visiting is not something we were aware of prior until yesterday. … We are aware that people were sleeping rough in the building the night before. Up to 15 people. We have spoken to 13 of those people and confirm they are safe and well. There are two other people we would like to track down and confirm they are safe and well. Our detectives are working furiously to try and locate those people. Dunstan: One person handed themselves in in Paddington and the other handed themselves in at Kings Cross. Dunstan says: The two people who were spoken to are 13 years old. We believe the others are a similar age … currently assisting us with our inquiries at this point. Acting assistant NSW police commissioner Paul Dunstan confirms two young people have handed themselves in relation to the Sydney inferno: We are aware of reports overnight of a group of young people seen running from the fire scene shortly after 4PM. I can confirm that two young people handed themselves in at two separate police stations in the late hours of last night. We are speaking with these young people throughout the evening and they are now assisting police with our inquiries. I can further confirm we are aware of a further three or four other young people who were present during the fire. We asked them to come forward with their parents and put their side of the story forward. Authorities are giving an update on the huge blaze which destroyed a heritage building in the centre of Sydney yesterday evening. Acting commissioner Jeremy Fewtrell says residents of the building will be unable to reoccupy it as the power remains cut off: We arrived at the fire scene, which is number 1-5 Randall St. It has had the power cut off as part of the electricity authority’s work to cut the power to the fire buildings. They are all interconnected and could not do it without closing that one off. Unfortunately because of that, the residents cannot reoccupy the building because obviously there is no system to make the building work and to be safe. Discussions are taking place with EnergyAustralia to work out if there is any other arrangements to make an alternative connection to put a generator in place, and will be ongoing. We are aware of the impact this fire has had on the residents who have been displaced. We are asking people in that situation to register through the Red Cross website, the register find reunite function. Once we have those details, we will be able to establish contact with them and keep them updated on any information about temporary arrangements or being able to return to their buildings when that is possible. Victorian mental health and LGBTIQ+ groups call for tougher anti-hate laws Some of Victoria’s biggest mental health and LGBTIQ+ organisations, including The Victorian Mental Illness Awareness Council, Transgender Victoria, Drummond Street and Switchboard have written to the attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, asking her to expand the anti-vilification laws. In the letter, they argue even the current laws are inadequate for everyone. They write: The religious and race-based protections are themselves inadequate, with very few successful civil cases before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal and even fewer successful criminal prosecutions for serious vilification. The legal ‘bar’ is too high, meaning the protection for the community is too low. At present, Victoria’s laws do not do enough to protect many marginalised communities from the hate we have seen on Melbourne’s streets. They applaud the government for expanding additional funding for the LGBTIQ+ specialist mental health care but say it will not be effective if there is increasing vilification of the community: This investment will cease to remain cost effective in environments whereby disproportionate levels of vilification towards particular groups continues to exacerbate threats of violence, high distress and suicidality. Symes has previously said she is committed to expanding the anti-vilification laws and will look at them in the next 18 months. This week Guardian Australia turns 10! If you didn’t tune into our 10th birthday event last night, you can share in the celebrations and take a look inside how we got where we are thanks to our special edition of Full Story: White House official outlines potential for collaboration on defence technologies with other countries White House official Mira Rapp-Hooper went on to draw a distinction between the two parts of Aukus, the security partnership between Australia, the US and the UK. Pillar one is the project for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. Pillar two, however, is the collaboration on advanced defence technologies, including artificial intelligence and hypersonics. The Aukus countries have long signalled their openness to work with non-members on particular advanced defence technology projects. Rapp-Hooper indicated these would be partners rather than members: Aukus itself has the potential to add additional partners through its pillar two efforts, which will be focused on expanding partnership in a number of areas of advanced capability ... I think what these partnerships [Aukus and Quad] have in common is that while the central mission may be designed around a relatively small number of fixture members, the broader mission has much wider opportunities for collaboration, and one could see a world in which that work continues to expand and the partners with whom the original membership is collaborating. White House: Quad likely to collaborate with partners but not looking to expand for the time being The Quad - which brings together the US, Australia, Japan and India - is likely to collaborate with an expanding range of partners in the region, a senior White House official has said. Mira Rapp-Hooper, the director for Indo-Pacific Strategy at the White House’s National Security Council, was asked during a webinar hosted by the US Studies Centre today how countries like South Korea or Canada or Indonesia might be able to “plug into” groupings like the Quad or Aukus. She replied: In the case of both the Quad and Aukus, the original membership of that structure remains the original membership for the time being. So the Quad has no plans to expand its membership, Aukus has no plans to expand its membership in pillar one, which of course is the submarine program, but both of these partnerships are over time going to provide an increasing set of opportunities for other like-minded partners to engage with a broad suite of work that each is doing. Rapp-Hooper noted the Quad’s project on maritime domain awareness had already seen the provision of radio frequency data to countries in the region: Now that already has the Quad interacting on a regular basis with countries in the Pacific islands, in south-east Asia and in the Indian Ocean region. So the Quad is actively partnering with countries who are not Quad members. Over time we can see that becoming an expanded set of countries, if for example there was another like-minded partner like Korea or like Canada that had some thing to bring to the table on a submarine cable project, or on a global health effort. But our understanding for the time being is that those outside partners, the collaboration with additional partners, will be on the basis of practical outcomes and work that is ongoing rather than expanding the membership itself. GPs urge government to act on inquiry’s recommendations into reproductive healthcare If you remember the health minister, Mark Butler, was quizzed about why the budget didn’t contain anything for improving reproductive healthcare, including abortion access. He said that was because the government was waiting on the recommendations of an inquiry which would inform its decisionmaking in the area. Well, that inquiry delivered its findings yesterday afternoon in a report title “ending the postcode lottery” – nodding to the significant disadvantage Australian women living outside capital cities face accessing reproductive healthcare. The report calls for better training and funding for healthcare workers to be providing long-acting reversible contraceptives (so those are hormonal implants, hormonal IUDs, and copper IUDs), as well as Medicare telehealth items including termination care to be continued. The Royal College of GPs have welcomed the findings and called for the government to take immediate action on them. Its president, Dr Nicole Higgins, said: As a Mackay GP, I know my patients who require a surgical abortion must travel over 1000km for care and that is not acceptable. Today’s report contains many promising recommendations the government can and should act on without delay. Our chief political correspondent, Paul Karp, has more on that Senate inquiry and the lay of the political land when it comes to abortion access here: AFP: commissioner does not believe different generations require different levels of praise The Australian Federal Police says its commissioner does not hold the belief different generations require different level of praise. The statement comes after the commissioner chose to give this “aside” at yesterday’s Senate Estimates: Just as an aside – if I can just drop this in – I think this is interesting. We learned too that Gen Zed, the younger generation, need three times a week praise from their supervisors. The next generation only need three times a year and my generation only need once a year. The AFP are seeking to set the record straight, releasing this statement this morning: Reports that AFP commissioner believes different generations require different level of praise are incorrect. The commissioner was referring to information recently presented to a policing forum. The former competition watchdog head Rod Sims says Australia’s big supermarkets have likely used their market power to increase prices higher than necessary during a cost-of-living crisis and that the government should consider reforming merger laws to limit their dominance. Sims, who retired as the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) last year, said Coles and Woolworths have little to worry about when making pricing decisions because they control two-thirds of the market. Sam Kerr wins again The Matildas captain, Sam Kerr, received yet another accolade on Thursday in London, becoming the first woman to collect England’s Football Writers’ Association’s prestigious Footballer of the Year trophy in two consecutive seasons. She picked up the award just a couple of days before she aims to shoot Chelsea to a fourth consecutive Women’s Super League title in England, thus completing another FA Cup-WSL double. Kerr said: I think to some people it might look easy, but every year it gets harder and harder to win the league. Anyone that’s involved in football knows how hard it is to come back year after year and to stay at the top. So we’re doing everything to win on Saturday. – AAP Snow is capping Kunanyi/Mt Wellington in Tasmania, which comes off a very blustery day yesterday. Joe Biden’s top Indo-Pacific adviser has reiterated that the US president offered Anthony Albanese his “deepest regrets” about the postponement of his planned trip to Australia. Biden attended the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, last weekend, but postponed trips to Papua New Guinea and Australia (where a Quad summit was to be held in Sydney) to oversee negotiations on the US debt ceiling. Kurt Campbell, the coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs at the White House National Security Council, is addressing a webinar organised by the United States Studies Centre. Campbell said Biden had felt that he could not postpone the entire trip to the region, because that would be “catastrophic”. Campbell acknowledged that the region was looking at whether the US could be “a steady predictable force”. Campbell said the determination was to still go to the G7 and to try to “resurrect as much as possible”. That included the holding of a Quad meeting in Hiroshima with Australians in the chair. (The Quad brings together the US, Australia, Japan and India.) Biden reached out to Albanese to express his “deepest regrets, really sincerest concerns about the consequences of this postponement”, Campbell said. But Campbell said the leaders were able to have a “consequential” Quad meeting in Hiroshima, and Australia and the US “signed a blockbuster agreement on climate and the provision of critical minerals”. Campbell also said Biden and Albanese also took steps to ensure “all elements of Aukus, both pillar 1 and pillar 2” were “on track”. Linda Burney commemorates the Stolen Generations on National Sorry Day As well as the sixth anniversary of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, today is also National Sorry Day, commemorating the Stolen Generations. The minister for Indigenous affairs, Linda Burney, told ABC Radio she felt “mixed emotions.” Twenty-six years ago the Bringing them Home report was tabled, and I’ll never forget the apology by Kevin Rudd 15 years ago, I was actually in the chamber. Even now the emotion wells up in you to think that these people in our lifetime were taken and had terrible experiences and the trauma is intergenerational. It’s also a story of survival, resilience and this country coming to terms with an awful part of its history. In their regular spot opposite each other on Nine News’ breakfast show, the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, hits back that Dutton is “making stuff up here.” At the end of last year, our intervention was about getting more gas into the east coast energy market. That’s what we were doing. Peter opposed it. That’s in the here and now. He can bang on about batteries. At the end of day, when there was an opportunity to act he opposed. Marles emphasised that the interventions into the energy market meant that even though energy prices are going up, they are lower than what they would have been otherwise. Dutton says Labor is reducing gas in energy sector too early Opposition leader Peter Dutton is this morning calling for more gas to be put into the grid to reduce energy costs following the news this morning that power bills could rise by up to 25% in some states. Dutton told the Today Show: We want to see more gas in the system. What the government is doing here is turning off the old system before the new one is ready. That’s what’s driving up prices … and I think the government’s completely underestimating how much families and small businesses are hurting at the moment. The government’s attacking the gas sector at the moment and reducing the amount of gas into the sector, the system, at a time when there is more demand. If you have got more demand for any commodity and you’re restricting supply, the price spikes. We’re in favour of renewable energy. But it needs to be firmed up during the hours of darkness when the solar panels won’t work and you have got the baseload cost. So, whether you have 65 [or] 85% of renewables, you have to firm that up. The trouble is they are turning off coal and gas way too early before the latest technology battery lasts for an hour. So, when the new battery comes, that is great. It’s not here yet. Precarious walls left after Sydney blaze may need to be demolished Superintendent Adam Dewberry from NSW Fire and Rescue is doing the rounds of the breakfast news shows sharing the latest on the Sydney inferno. He’s told ABC News Breakfast those two walls still in precarious positions will likely need to be demolished: Our priority is to get people back into their residence and also to get communities and the businesses reopened. We still have a problem with two walls in precarious positions and could come down without notice, bringing tons and tons of bricks down and causing projectiles and causing injury, damage or even death. That’s why our exclusion zone is so tight. … It looks like making it safe will include a demolition of the walls down it a level where it is safe. Dewberry says planning is currently occurring between authorities and local council. We’ve heard from Fire and Rescue NSW that there is still the potential for further collapse around the seven-storey Sydney building which went up in flames last night. The emergency organisation have shared the moment a huge part of the building’s facade came down yesterday evening: Voice referendum ‘not the plaything of politicians’, Indigenous affairs minister says On the pushback against the voice from the right and left, Burney says she’s met with both the independent Senator Lydia Thorpe and the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Jacinta Price. While Price’s position with the Nationals is a hard no to supporting the voice, Burney says the pair spoke about education in central Australia. Thorpe’s position on the voice is still undecided, with her not advocating for a no or yes vote. Burney says she’d like her to support the alteration bill but ultimately it’s up to her. The important thing is not about the left or the right of politics. What’s important is the Australian people this is their referendum, this is their decision. It is not the plaything of politicians. Linda Burney: voice referendum chance to power ‘the wheel of history’ Indigenous leaders are returning to Uluru today six years since the Uluru Statement from the heart was delivered. The statement underpins the voice to parliament, which the nation will vote on in a referendum before the end of the year. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, is in the Red Centre but she says she is not concerned by a recent poll by the Nine newspapers which indicate the yes campaign is losing support. Burney tells ABC Radio: Individuals that know that this is their time to put their shoulder on the wheel of history and give it a shove. The momentum is just enormous. We are at Uluru – I am looking at Uluru right now with the sun coming up as I was speaking to you – and I feel buoyed and I feel confident. I know that we’ve still got six or seven months to run and I am sure that the Australian people will rise rise to this occasion. Read more from our Indigenous affairs editor Lorena Allam, who is also on the ground at Uluru: Evacuated dental hospital near site of Sydney blaze becomes emergency services hub While the light rail that runs past the charred husk of the burnt out building on Randle Ln is running this morning, many of the roads are blocked off by police tape, including a usually very busy section of Elizabeth St, which will likely have an impact on morning traffic. The total area cordoned off around the building is about six blocks. A hand-scrawled sign on the usually packed Elizabeth St bus stop directs people to the nearby Eddy Ave. The Sydney Dental Hospital - a short distance away from the burnt out building - was evacuated yesterday. It’s now being used as a hub for the emergency services gathered at the site. Water pours past it in the street, downhill, where the media is gathered. Sydney fire ‘pretty much out’ but concern walls may still collapse Staying on the Sydney inferno, Superintendent Adam Dewberry from NSW Fire and Rescue says the the fire is “pretty much out” after firefighters worked up until 2am this morning to ensure hot spots were out. However, Dewberry told the Today Show there is still serious concern more walls could collapse without notice. There’s else a lot of work to be done. The building opposite has been damaged by that extreme heat. Firefighters were able to cut that fire off from spreading into the building across the road. But the main priority is that wall. There are two walls that are in a precarious position. Dewberry says there is a “very good chance” they are likely to fall “without notice.” We are talking about tonnes and tonnes of bricks that could come down and become projectiles that is why we have such a tight exclusion zone, not allowing anyone in, including firefighter[s], until we get the engineers in. Morning update on Sydney blaze The charred remains of the heritage listed multi-story brick building on Sydney’s Randle Lane are visible from the Central station underpass this morning. About three complete storeys of the six storey building collapsed yesterday during the inferno that took hold about 4pm and quickly engulfed the building. The partially collapsed structure is strewn across Randle St, and a police line prevents members of the public from getting too close. Water pours out from underneath an adjacent building abutting the light rail. A police officer tells me the apartment blocks nearby are still empty as the building is structurally unsound, and spot fires are still being put out. New South Wales is the first state to consider introducing fines for betrayal of trust for companies that leak sensitive government tax information to clients following the PwC tax scandal. The state’s finance minister, Courtney Houssos, is telling ABC Radio the fines would be in the multimillions: I’m working with the chief commissioner for state revenue to implement a change to our policy that will ensure that severe penalties will apply to advisors and also to organisations who seek commercial advantage by sharing confidential tax related information. We’re looking at multimillion dollar fines for both the individuals involved and also for the organisations. We think that when you are provided with confidential tax information by the government, that any breach of that trust should be tightened and there should be very, very serious consequences for that. Good morning! Natasha May stepping up to the plate to serve you the rest of today’s live news coverage. Australia should toughen up its laws against modern slavery, including by imposing fines on businesses that lie about actions they are tacking to tackle the problem, a government-ordered review has found. The Modern Slavery Act, which took effect in 2019, aims to push businesses to tackle a range of risks in their supply chains, including human trafficking, servitude, worker exploitation, child labour, forced marriage, debt bondage and deceptive recruiting. Big businesses are required to report steps they are taking to address the problem in statements posted on a government-run register - but the reporting obligations have long been criticised for lacking teeth. In a report tabled by the government in parliament late yesterday, Prof John McMillan said the consultations he oversaw had found “a widely endorsed view” that there was “no hard evidence that the Modern Slavery Act in its early years has yet caused meaningful change for people living in conditions of modern slavery”. McMillan has made 30 recommendations, including requiring businesses that have annual revenue of $50m or more to report the steps they are taking on the issue. That means the rules will cover a larger number of businesses, because the current reporting threshold is $100m of annual revenue. McMillan also recommended making it a penalty for failing to submit modern slavery statements, failing to take specified remedial action, or making a statement “that knowingly includes materially false information”. He wrote: Proposed legislative changes largely target what are seen to be the three main weaknesses in the present Act – the standard of modern slavery reporting is variable, the reporting obligation is not properly enforceable, and the process is at risk of being drowned by a sea of large and incompatible statements. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, and the acting attorney general, Katy Gallagher, said the government would consider the recommendations, but noted that many of them were in line with Labor election commitments. WA premier: ‘unthinkable’ US-style school shooting nearly occurred Mark McGowan, state premier, said it was “unthinkable” that a US-style school shooting could have happened at a WA school. He told reporters yesterday during a visit to the school: We are very lucky no one was killed. The bullets went close. It’s a terrible, terrible thing and it could have been so much worse. This is extraordinary stuff. This is the sort of thing you see occurring in the deep south of America. McGowan said work was already under way to dramatically reform the state’s gun laws. A 15-year-old boy has been charged with multiple offences after he allegedly drove to a school in Western Australia and shot at a classroom as scared students hid in fear, AAP reports. The incident at Atlantis Beach Baptist College north of Perth on Wednesday is understood to be the first firearms episode at a school in Western Australia. Police arrested the boy at the scene at about 11.50am after he allegedly fired three rounds, with two shots hitting a classroom. Western Australia police on Thursday charged the teen with a count of driving without authority, three counts of possessing an unlicensed firearm and ammunition, discharging a firearm to cause fear, possessing a prohibited weapon and acting unlawfully with intent to harm. The boy was expected to face the Perth children’s court this morning. Officers took the teen into custody without incident on Wednesday, seizing two rifles, a .243 and .22 calibre, allegedly found in a car at the scene. The weapons are understood to be registered to the boy’s father. Fire and Rescue NSW Supt Adam Dewberry praised people living in apartments and other buildings near the scene of the huge fire in Sydney yesterday for evacuating promptly when multiple fire alarms went off. He also said quick-thinking firefighters prevented the flames from destroying adjacent buildings by hosing them down and stopping the fire from spreading. There were some fires that spread into the apartment buildings … firefighters were able to extinguish those and prevent them further penetrating into the buildings and causing significant damage. Supt Dewberry said it was believed the two buildings involved in the blaze were vacant. It was an incredibly intense fire and the age of the building, the type of construction with lots of timber frames and floors, and with that, very well seasoned and dry timber. Our firefighters have done a wonderful job to get on top of this fire. Supt Dewberry said there were no reports of injuries to members of the public and only one firefighter suffered a minor burn to his arm.

I’m Martin Farrer and here are the top stories this Friday morning. Ministers are under fire for delays in implementing plans to detain arrivals to the UK from high-risk countries in coronavirus quarantine hotels, with Labour accusing the government of “putting people at risk”. Lack of details about the plan forced the government to announce yesterday that the health secretary, Matt Hancock, would take personal charge of the scheme under which passengers from a “red list” have to pay for their own accommodation from 15 February. It had been hoped that mandatory isolation would be in place by now to stop the spread of new variants of Covid-19. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the scheme was “half-baked” as hotel chains said they had been kept in the dark about the plans. Despite hope this week about case numbers reaching a peak, former health secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that the cabinet should not lift the current lockdown until cases were down to 1,000 a day. “We mustn’t make the mistake that we made last year” in ending restrictions too early, he tells the Guardian. Up to 100 children a week are being hospitalised with a rare disease that can emerge weeks after Covid-19, leaving them in intensive care, doctors have said. Three-quarters of those worst affected by paediatric inflammatory multi-system syndrome were black, Asian or ethnic minority. It comes as figures showed white people aged over 80 were twice as likely to have had the vaccine as their black peers. In more optimistic news, a cheap drug normally used to treat gout – colchicine – has been found to have the potential to significantly reduce hospital stays among Covid-19 patients. And the US company Johnson &amp; Johnson is seeking approval from regulators for the first single-dose vaccine. As the UK death toll passed 110,000, we remember some more victims of the pandemic, including an NHS worker, a Tibetan rights activist and a police officer.

They accuse ministers of the seeming contradiction between allowing the UK’s first new deep coalmine in three decades while trying to garner support from world leaders for a fresh deal on the climate crisis. In addition, some 80 activist groups have written to the prime minister urging him to block the development near Whitehaven. * * * Republican removed – The US House of Representatives has voted to eject the Republican extremist Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee roles in the fallout over her incendiary comments about race.

President Joe Biden has announced a reset of US foreign policy, starting with withdrawing support for the Saudi offensive in Yemen. Donald Trump said he would not testify at his impeachment trial, which starts on Tuesday. * * * Hospital lockdown – Police in Scotland last night imposed a lockdown at University Hospital Crosshouse in the Ayrshire town of Kilmarnock because of a “serious incident” following reports of a stabbing at the site and another two “potentially linked” incidents in the area. The emergency lasted three hours while police dealt with the first problem, while officers then shut down part of the town centre following another incident. Finally, a “serious” car crash on the nearby A76 was being investigated. * * * Myanmar arrest – Myanmar’s generals have tightened their grip on the country by arresting a key aide of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi days after a coup that has sparked outrage around the world. Win Htein was detained hours after he told an English-language news service that Monday’s seizure of power was “not wise”. It follows the arrest of Suu Kyi and Myanmar president Win Myint as the military took control of the south-east Asian nation. The military had earlier blocked access to Facebook in the country. * * * Power play – The world’s biggest battery will be built in the Hunter Valley in Australia as the country ratchets up its renewable energy capability. The 1,200MW storage battery is about eight times greater than a battery in South Australia, which was the biggest when it began operating in 2017. The new facility will help harness huge solar power output and challenge the viability of fossil fuel power production.

Now they want retribution","bodyText":"For years, an elderly man stood as a regular fixture around his East Baltimore neighborhood for the way he would wander the streets in the summer, trying to stay outside his sweltering home until nightfall. This man, who suffers from dementia, lived in a row house that shared side walls with its neighboring homes. With windows only in the front and back, there was little air flow, which trapped the heat inside. It’s not unusual for the upper floors in such homes to be several degrees hotter than the temperature outdoors. During a nearly two-week heatwave that swept through the city in July 2019, Cynthia Brooks, executive director of the Bea Gaddy Family Center, a local non-profit that provides food and other services for the poor and homeless, noticed she hadn’t seen the man for a while. Finally, on one of the “code red” days – when the forecasted heat index is expected to be at 105F (40.56C) or higher – he stumbled out of his house, looking disoriented. No one knows how long he had been sitting inside, alone, without a fan or air conditioning. This man had no one to call – no family was around, and alerting emergency responders could have led to a hefty medical bill. Brooks dropped everything and took him to nearby Johns Hopkins hospital, where he was diagnosed with heatstroke and given treatment. After that incident, Brooks became his legal custodian. He currently lives in a senior home nearby, and she makes his treatment decisions. This man represents the population in Baltimore most likely to face the personal impacts of the climate crisis. Around the country, global heating is increasing the frequency, intensity and duration of summer heatwaves. The recent triple-digit temperatures across the Pacific north-west, where air conditioning in homes isn’t common, highlight the real-world hardships caused by extreme heat exposure and how the elderly and homeless suffer disproportionately from physical discomfort and worse health outcomes. Mitigating such public health issues, along with damage to infrastructure and losses in tourism revenue and agriculture, are among the major costs of climate change in Baltimore. Now, the city is looking for retribution. In a recent lawsuit, the city argues that fossil fuel companies should be held responsible for such costs because they knowingly contributed to the climate crisis. Baltimore’s case is one of more than 20 suits brought by a range of other cities, states and counties that are suing the major oil conglomerates for driving the climate crisis and offloading the financial burden onto the American public. The legal strategy is a novel approach toward addressing the climate crisis, and some legal experts believe Baltimore’s suit may be the bellwether for similar efforts across the country. The case has caught the attention of the US supreme court, which in May ruled in favor of the oil companies over a legal technicality. While the ruling gives the fossil fuel industry the green light to pursue arguing their case in federal court, where they believe they will face better odds than in state court, the legal process is expected to reveal new information on what the industry knew of the environmental destruction brought by climate change. The Baltimore case, in particular, highlights the ways that densely populated urban areas bear the burdens of extreme weather patterns. Marginalized communities are the most likely to face the effects. Stretches of hot weather in the city have become more frequent over the past 40 years. According to the National Weather Service, there are 12 months in all of Baltimore’s history that saw 20 or more days of 90-degree temperatures or above; 10 of those months have occurred since 1980. Last summer, 16 people died for heat-related reasons, three of whom were suspected or presumed homeless, according to statistics from the Baltimore city health department. On one day in 2020, there were more than 90 emergency department complaints due to heat-related illness, including hyperthermia, dehydration and sunburn. “Go to Johns Hopkins at any given time in the summer and people are complaining about heat exhaustion. People are getting picked up on the side of the street because they pass out,” Brooks says. “If you are homeless, you are subjected to all layers of heat.” *** Though we typically think of rising tides affecting coastal communities, extreme weather patterns and wildfires out west as pressure points brought by climate change, heat islands in urban areas represent the very real, but often invisible, climate change threats that harm low-income communities in particular. Dark-colored roads and rooftops absorb heat from the sun and release it back into the air, increasing temperatures in their vicinity, an effect that’s more pronounced in the evenings. Even within a city, neighborhoods with less vegetation feel hotter. East Baltimore, particularly the area north of Patterson Park, is considered the city’s most extreme urban heat island, according to a 2018 study by researchers at Portland State University in Oregon and the Science Museum of Virginia. Scientists say temperatures in such pockets can be as much as 10 to 20 degrees hotter than other parts of the city due to a high concentration of pavement and a lack of shade from trees. Central air conditioning is rare in the neighborhood, and often the wiring in the buildings is so old that a window unit could short circuit. For those able to install an AC unit, the energy required to run it is often too expensive for someone on a fixed income. Fans help somewhat, but often they end up just circulating the hot air. Combined with heat-trapping row houses, illness caused by extreme heat is a major risk. Climate change has also been shown to lengthen allergy season and worsen air quality, and heat can worsen chronic health conditions, such as various respiratory, cerebral and cardiovascular diseases. The city in recent years has worked to increase its number of cooling centers – air-conditioned public spaces that are a common strategy in many cities. Last year, because the Covid-19 pandemic prevented people from gathering in closed spaces, the city increased its efforts to keep people cooler while at home. The department of health purchased about 20,000 box fans to distribute to senior citizens. In addition, the Maryland Food Bank provided water to be distributed at community resiliency hubs throughout the city. Tehma Smith Wilson, chief operating officer of The Door, a community resiliency hub that helped distribute the fans and water to residents living in the hottest part of the city, said it was an enormously popular program. The long walks to such facilities, however, can deter people from taking advantage of them. Many seniors who stand to benefit from the city’s services often struggle with mobility. And because people remained socially distanced during the pandemic, they had to line up outside, in areas without much green space. The water provided much-needed relief and the fans disappeared quickly, but there were still logistical challenges getting them to those who needed them most. “You might be able to walk there, but then are you capable of carrying it two or three blocks away?” said Wilson. Other longer-term efforts to help people deal with the heat include weatherizing housing by plugging leaks, adding insulation and installing air conditioning. Several community organizations have received energy efficiency upgrades to accommodate solar power and battery storage so they can continue to serve their communities if there is a power outage. Backup power services are unequally distributed in cities. The city has also amped up efforts in recent years to plant trees and add more city-maintained green spaces, with a particular focus on neighborhoods that lack shade, such as East and West Baltimore. As of 2015, the city had 28% tree canopy coverage. In East Baltimore, many neighborhoods by comparison had tree canopy of about 10%, according to a University of Maryland Howard Center for Investigative Journalism analysis of data gathered by researchers at the US Forest Service and the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Lab. City officials hope that by 2030, Baltimore will reach 40% tree coverage. Roxane Prettyman, community outreach director for First Mount Calvary Baptist church in Sandtown-Winchester, another community resiliency hub in West Baltimore, says that people in the area often have to walk long distances to a grocery or a convenience store, meaning they have to stay outside longer in extreme weather without shade. In addition to adding more green spaces, she believes more retail options are also necessary. Schools also need air conditioning. On code red days, students from schools without cooling systems are sent back to homes that are also too hot. A recent study showed that in years when there are more hot days, students do worse on standardized tests – a longer-term impact of extreme weather. In the meantime, residents of the hottest areas have to think creatively about how to deal with the heat. Irwin Wilson, 64, a volunteer at The Door, says he tries to stay outside. While 137-acre Patterson Park is a few blocks away from his home, the location is inconvenient. Instead he relies on small spots of shade wherever he can find them, but the options are limited. Though the city has made efforts to plant trees, many of them are still young and don’t provide significant cover. He chases every couple feet of shade he can find, even if it’s from a single branch. “You find some shade, and if you stay still long enough you find a breeze,” said Wilson, 64. In Karen Lewis’s rowhouse in East Baltimore, she has to be innovative to stay cool in the summers. She covers up the skylight in her upstairs bathroom so sunlight gets blocked. She has an air conditioner, but she uses it sparingly due to the cost to move some cool air in. Mostly, she uses a series of strategically placed fans. But in spite of these adaptations, Lewis, 61, who does odd jobs, including making jewelry and sometimes providing cleaning and assisted living services, says the heat often feels so thick that it gives her trouble breathing. “It’s very hot,” said Lewis. “If I put on a fan, it’s still very, very humid in there.” *** In addition to the heat, Baltimore is also experiencing the lasting effects of climate change through extreme storms. The city has seen has an increase in nuisance flooding, or flooding that is caused by tidal fluctuations rather than rainstorms, according to Aubrey Germ, the climate and resilience planner for Baltimore’s office of sustainability. Extreme weather events in the Atlantic Ocean sometimes cause rising shorelines in Baltimore. The waterfront, which the city recently revitalized and attracts millions of visitors each year, is particularly vulnerable to flooding, and is a major factor in the city’s lawsuit. Baltimore consists of five watersheds, which also makes it prone to flash flooding. There has also been an increase in microbursts, rainstorms that linger over certain areas of the city for longer periods rather than moving through, which overwhelms the storm water system. Several intersections, particularly in south-east and north-east Baltimore, have had repeated flooding that has damaged cars, businesses and homes. In the short term, the city has become more vigilant about regularly cleaning storm drains. But in the long term, infrastructure improvements are needed. City workers cannot comment on the costs of projects associated with the climate crisis as the city’s lawsuit is ongoing. Residents say that such extreme weather events take a long financial and psychological toll. In 2018, Baltimore received a so-called 1,000-year rainstorm, meaning there is 0.1% of a chance in any year for a storm like that to hit. This was just two years after a similar deluge. Almost 150 homes near a portion of Frederick Avenue, in south-west Baltimore, were flooded. Most of the damage was to basements, but some people’s first floors were also affected. They had to fix structural damage and buy new hot water heaters. In the months following the 2018 event, two other flash floods sloshed through, destroying their progress. Only some were able to cover these costs through insurance. “That numerical anomaly is what really traumatizes a lot of the residents, many of whom are senior citizens,” says Michael S Martin, lead pastor at Stillmeadow Community Fellowship, another resiliency hub. “Even today, if it gets cloudy, we will get a few calls from individuals worried about what they should do.” Martin says that while much of the media’s focus in the 2018 storm was on damage to commercial buildings in nearby Ellicott City, a suburb outside of the city and former mill town that is known for its historic charm, more homes were damaged in the mostly Black area near Frederick Avenue. Similarly, the efforts to solve infrastructure problems appear, to him, to be moving faster there than in his neighborhood. In the summers, residents are doubly affected by extreme heat. “The city offering water and fans to residents is conscientious and thoughtful,” he says. “We’re doing what we can at a small level, but what’s our overall national response to our cities getting hotter?” This story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/oct/10/investors-and-graduates-flock-to-uks-burgeoning-windfarms","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-10T15:00:39Z","webTitle":"Investors and graduates flock to UK's burgeoning windfarms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/10/investors-and-graduates-flock-to-uks-burgeoning-windfarms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/oct/10/investors-and-graduates-flock-to-uks-burgeoning-windfarms","fields":{"headline":"Investors and graduates flock to UK's burgeoning windfarms","bodyText":"The Hywind offshore windfarm stands 15 miles off the coast of Peterhead, and firmly on the cusp of Britain’s most dramatic energy revolution since the discovery of North Sea oil. The world’s first floating windfarm was one of the first low-carbon energy projects developed by Norway’s state oil giant Equinor, and today is one of the best performing windfarms ever built. “On a super-clear day you might just be able to make them out from land,” says Equinor’s Stephen Bull, of the turbines floating above the ageing crude oil pipelines which criss-cross the North Sea. The government hopes that within the next 10 years there will be enough offshore turbines to power every home in Britain, including more world-leading floating windfarms. Boris Johnson last week set out plans to use offshore wind power as the backbone of Britain’s carbon-neutral energy future, calling for 10 times the existing offshore wind capacity by 2030, or 40GW, including 1GW of floating turbines. The plan to become the “Saudi Arabia of wind power” is one of the most ambitious British industrial endeavours since oil rigs began populating the North Sea in the 1960s. It will require the equivalent of one turbine to be installed every weekday for the whole of the next decade, and £50bn of private-sector investment. But within the industry there is little doubt that it can be done. Investor appetite has been whetted by years of falling costs, guaranteed returns and growing political support. The sector has already exceeded expectations in recent years to emerge as one of Britain’s great modern industrial success stories – and it is ready to do so again. The catch? It needs government ministers to translate the rhetoric to reality. “We are very keen on doing more floating offshore projects in the UK,” says Bull. “We absolutely welcome the 1GW target from the government, but we could easily get up to 2GW if we have the right government support.” As part of the government’s plan, it has promised £160m to upgrade Britain’s ports to manage the giant turbine blades as they pass through on their way to sea. Better ports bring benefits to local communities and help to establish supply chains which can act as an economic multiplier for the benefits of offshore wind. But the industry’s concerns centre on the government’s auction of project contracts, which guarantee a set revenue stream for their clean electricity via energy bills. The reverse auction has delivered record low prices which are unlikely to raise household costs. And the next one will be held in the spring. But there will need to be many more over the next decade to meet the government’s targets, and they will need to be far bigger too. In return for having the gates opened to more offshore projects, the industry has promised to play a major role in the government’s bid to “build back better” from the coronavirus crisis as part of a green economic recovery. The upcoming auction alone, which will include onshore wind and solar power for the first time in four years, could secure more than £20bn of investment and create 12,000 jobs. Jasmine Allen, 20, is an apprentice at SSE, which is building the world’s largest offshore windfarm alongside Equinor at Dogger Bank off the coast of Yorkshire. She is one of many young people entering the renewable energy industry for whom the government’s new offshore wind targets could guarantee a long-term career. “I think it’s fantastic,” she says. “I think it will open up new jobs, better the areas where the projects are, and create new opportunities for people to build careers.” Increasing the pace and scale of project auctions also bolsters Britain’s burgeoning supply chain of manufacturers and engineers. They will have the confidence to make long-term investments, take on more work, and reap the benefit of a growing industry. Eishar Bassan, 23, is a graduate trainee at Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, a company responsible for building some of the largest wind turbines in the world. She is working on the Neart na Gaoithe windfarm, about nine miles off the east coast of Scotland, where turbines with 80-metre-long blades will spin to generate enough electricity to power the whole of Edinburgh. The prime minister’s offshore wind pledge was welcomed by colleagues, she says. “It’s ambitious, and really exciting. But there were also people being kind of cynical, like, ‘I hope the government actually pulls through and delivers’,” she adds. Bassan is one of many young engineering graduates who have chosen to work in Britain’s renewables industry in part because it will help tackle the climate crisis and create a carbon-neutral economy by the UK’s target date of 2050. “I just hope that [the government] recognises that the climate emergency is real and it’s happening right now. We need to fight – in this generation, and the next generation and the next generation – for net zero,” she says. “In 10 years’ time I definitely still want to be here, and be able to use what I’ve learned to help lead the development of these windfarms. It’s how I can help stop climate change. “I’m just hoping that the government has some substance behind this plan, to actually execute the things they promise.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2019/mar/18/tottenham-hotspur-station-is-a-bad-idea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-18T19:20:10Z","webTitle":"Tottenham Hotspur station is a bad idea | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/18/tottenham-hotspur-station-is-a-bad-idea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2019/mar/18/tottenham-hotspur-station-is-a-bad-idea","fields":{"headline":"Tottenham Hotspur station is a bad idea","bodyText":"I’m a long-term Tottenham resident and lifelong Spurs fan living just a few minutes’ walk from the stadium.

Yesterday I was 100%,” Howard Richmond said, using an app telling him how much of his London home’s electricity consumption is from his solar panels and Tesla battery. The retired solicitor lives in one of the 840,000-plus homes in the UK with solar panels and is part of an even more exclusive club of up to 10,000 with battery storage. Richmond and other solar households should reap a windfall this week because of a forecast of sunshine and blue skies, which could result in renewable energy records being smashed. Solar has grown rapidly in the UK’s power mix. A decade ago it provided virtually nothing; now it regularly generates about a fifth of the country’s electricity for hours on a summer’s day. Electricity generation from solar panels reached a peak of 9.38GW last Friday, edging close to the record of 9.42GW. The highest percentage of power to ever come from solar was 28.5% on 6 May – and last Sunday came come close with a 27.5% share. However, the household market has been dubbed the “solarcoaster” by industry, because of the booms and busts driven by the feed-in tariff regime, the main government support scheme, which started in 2010. Those incentives were slashed dramatically at the start of 2016, largely killing the financial attraction for householders. Installations plummeted and companies folded. Next April the scheme closes entirely and ministers are yet to signal that it will be replaced. Unsurprisingly, that has led to a bleak outlook for household solar. Growth halved last year, which the government says is “not surprising”, given earlier rapid expansion. Only 14MW of domestic solar is forecast to be fitted this year, down from a peak of 606MW in 2011, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “This is heartbreaking for me,” Alan Simpson, an adviser to the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said. One of the architects of the feed-in tariffs, Simpson said the importance of household solar was not only the clean energy it brings online but the cultural, political and social impact of engaging people with renewables at a local level. He blames the government and big fossil fuel-based energy companies for bringing household solar to a halt. “We’ve got a completely inverted sense of how the shift into clean energy systems will take place and the role households can play in the process. We disempower and discourage households from being part of the clean energy transformation,” he said. Solar advocates are pinning their hopes for a revival on the continuing fall in the cost of panels, and complementary technologies, including household batteries and electric cars. Jeremy Leggett, the founder of Solarcentury, one of the UK’s largest solar companies, said: “It’s in flux but it’s heading in a very exciting direction. We’re coming out of the doldrums, whatever the government does.” While the former oil geologist admits the UK solar market is stagnant, he thinks the direction of travel is clear. Household batteries such as Tesla’s Powerwall, for example, enable people to consume rather than export their solar electricity, which makes more financial sense. An energy supplier sells a kilowatt hour of power to a householder for in the region of 15p, much higher than the 5.24p a solar home can earn for exporting to the grid and the 4.01p for generation under the feed-in tariff. Ryan McShea of Empower Energy, one of the few solar installers to weather the subsidy cuts, said he had been surprised by the uptake this year. “We’ve found a lot of people going for solar and batteries together.” Solar panel costs have come down by about a fifth in the past year, he said, which he expected to filter down to cheaper systems for consumers. A typical 4KW array of solar panels costs about £6,000, down from £12,000-£14,000 when the feed-in tariffs began. That price can come down even more for bulk purchases, the industry pointed out, potentially to as low as £3,200. While the economics of solar are improving, few think they will stack up in coming years without some form of continued support. Labour would renew the feed-in tariff scheme at a modest level, rather than let it fade away. “Basically, this is the long-term consequence of the ‘cut the green crap’ stuff,” said Alan Whitehead, the shadow energy minister, in reference to David Cameron’s reported comments on renewable energy support in 2015. “We would not want to see the [feed-in tariffs] regime disappear in 2019, we would like to see it continue but on a clear path,” said Whitehead, who envisages funding the scheme with a “tiny fraction” of the £557m ministers have earmarked for large renewable energy subsidies. A Labour government would take a more holistic view of support for solar, too, he said, such as paving the way for an aggregator to bundle together many households’ solar output and trade it at a local level to other homes that need it. A helping hand may also come from a backdrop of electricity prices, which are increasing in the face of rising wholesale costs. E.ON this week said it was putting electricity prices up 6.6% from August. Back in Islington, Richmond looked at his electricity bill, which has fallen to £18 a month for a three-storey terraced house. The financial savings are not his main driver, however. “My prime motivation was I wanted to see if I could be self-powered in north London in a cloudy rainy country,” he said. “If I can do it, so can the world.” Wind becalmed as weather improves Britain has suffered a wind drought throughout much of June, leading to a significant drop in output from the country’s largest source of renewable power. While the hot, still weather has been a boon for beachgoers and solar panel owners, figures compiled by Imperial College London show that wind power generation this month is down nearly a quarter on June last year. Turbines have been frequently left standing still, with several days having almost no wind at all. The Met Office said the high pressure causing the country’s heatwave was suppressing windy conditions. About half of the UK’s electricity is usually supplied by gas power stations, followed by nuclear and wind, although windfarms overtook nuclear for the first time during the first quarter of the year. However, in June so far, wind has averaged only 3.4GW of output, or about 11% of power demand. That is down 24% on June 2017, which averaged 4.6GW or 15% of demand. The significant drop-off comes despite the fact that the total capacity of windfarms on land and at sea has grown considerably since last June. Installed capacity is up 2.5GW, to 20GW. Experts said the wind drought highlighted the need for a diverse energy supply. Dr Iain Staffell, a lecturer in sustainable energy at Imperial College London, said: “This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely on one source of electricity alone. Back in March the UK nearly ran out of gas during the cold snap; now in June it is wind that is in short supply. “The UK’s weather is anything but dependable, so the key is to have a diverse mix of sources that work together.” The wind power industry said that technical innovations such as batteries were helping the technology become more flexible. Emma Pinchbeck, RenewableUK’s executive director, said: “National Grid can predict with pinpoint accuracy how much electricity will be generated from wind 24 hours in advance. We need a wide variety of energy sources competing against each other to ensure that consumers get the best value for money.” By contrast, solar has had a strong June, going some way to offsetting wind’s shortfalls. For 13 days of the month, solar panels outstripped windfarms for electricity generation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jul/28/leading-the-charge-can-i-make-it-from-lands-end-to-john-ogroats-in-an-electric-car","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-28T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Leading the charge!

Can I make it from Land’s End to John o’Groats in an electric car?","bodyText":"Range anxiety hits hard on the A9 in the Highlands of Scotland. For the uninitiated, this is the fear that an electric vehicle (EV) won’t reach its destination before running out of power. I’m driving through some of Britain’s loveliest landscape – mountains, rivers, lochs and firths – but I hardly notice. I’m focused hard – on the road in front, but mainly on two numbers on the dashboard. One is how far it is in miles to where I’m going; the other is the range in miles remaining in the battery. Sometimes, especially on downhill stretches when what is known as “regenerative braking” means the battery is getting charged, I tell myself it’s going to be OK, I’ll make it. But going uphill the range plummets. Squeaky bum time. Plus, I’ve read Michel Faber’s Under the Skin. I know what happens to men stranded on the A9. To range anxiety add the fear of being processed and eaten by aliens. It’s the hottest day of the year so far, but I can’t risk the air conditioning, because that immediately wipes about 10% off the range. I’ve heard that opening windows makes a car less aerodynamic, so they remain closed. Sweaty bum time, too. Driving as gently as possible, nursing the car along, barely touching the accelerator or the brake, phone unplugged, radio off, I head north in sweltering, silent panic. Guilt-free, though, on account of being emissions-free at the tailpipe. I find myself behind a lorry. I tuck in behind, into its slipstream. Potential salvation by Alsop Transport Services of Oban, Argyll. I’m going to surf this baby all the way home. Well, hopefully, all the way to John o’Groats, because that is where I’m heading. I should say that the predicament I find myself in has less to do with the car I’m driving (a Škoda Enyaq; brilliant) or Britain’s infrastructure for charging EVs (extensive, not brilliant; we’ll come to that) and more about my organisation skills (even less brilliant). Most of the EV charging points in Scotland are run by ChargePlace Scotland. To use them, you sign up and they send you a card to operate the machines. I signed up, but not in time to get the card, so I’m relying on the few charging points not run by ChargePlace Scotland. Well, it will make it more of a challenge, I thought. I’m driving my Enyaq, a family SUV, from Land’s End to John o’Groats. Why? Several reasons. Of the 30m cars on UK roads, only about 250,000 are purely electric, but that number is going up fast. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders released figures in July showing that sales of new electric cars had jumped 50% in the previous month. EVs will outsell petrol and diesel models by about 2025. The government ban on new petrol and diesel cars has been brought forward, from 2040 to 2030. “However attached you are to your old car, 2030 is coming fast and you’ll be left with a car with no value,” warns Prof Liana Cipcigan of the Electric Vehicle Centre of Excellence at Cardiff University. If you get a new car, it’s increasingly likely to be an electric one. Perhaps you’ve got one already, you’re about to head off on a UK holiday in it and you’re worried. I’m here for you: driving the longest possible route in the country to see if it’s feasible. It’s not my Enyaq: it has been loaned to me by Škoda. This one costs £34,495 to buy, including a £2,500 government grant. Still a fair old whack, but EVs are expensive: even a little Renault Zoe costs £27,500. The cheapest Tesla is more than 40 grand. EVs are much cheaper to run than other cars, though. Research by the price comparison website Uswitch found that, if you charge at home, you can squeeze 2,380 miles (3,830km) out of a Nissan Leaf E+ for £50. Compare that with only 443 miles for a similar-sized VW Golf. Edmund King, the president of the AA, says that service costs should be lower, too, because EVs are simpler. “The main things are tyres and brakes – there’s very little else in the vehicle. Initially, insurance was expensive, but that seems to be coming down. You don’t pay Vehicle Excise Duty, London congestion charge is free [until December 2025], some authorities give you incentives to park.” He also says that lots of people get EVs on leases, because of uncertainty about battery life and rapidly changing technology. Enough background facts. You want to hear more about my epic journey, right? Land’s End is a miserable place: expensive parking before you queue up to pay more to have your photo taken by a signpost. But, more importantly, there is a rapid charger there (Gridserve, 30p/kWh). I can get from low up to 80% in about half an hour, as opposed to hours on a slow charger or at home. So I get a top-up charge. Plus a discharge, from a gull, right on the bonnet – splat. Not an EV fan, apparently. Before the charge, however, I have to wait 45 minutes for a glamorous couple charging their glamorous Tesla. They came down from London, charging it once on the way, although they say they could have done it in one. Yeah, all right, move along now. One of the really annoying things about Teslas is that they have their own special superchargers, sometimes at the same site; other stations are for Teslas only. We, by which I mean non-Tesla EV plebs, can’t use them, whereas they can use ours. I also meet Amanda and Mike, who have come from York in their electric Kia, having traded in their petrol car for environmental reasons. They get 270 miles on a charge, less in winter. They could have done the journey with one stop, but they put in another. That seems to be a thing among EV drivers: slipping in a cheeky little extra charge, to fend off the anxiety. King doesn’t think range anxiety should be an issue. With new EVs capable, on average, of 200 miles, “that’s going to cover the vast majority of people’s journeys. At the AA, in terms of breakdowns for EVs, only 4% are running out of charge.” Careful, Edmund, I can always bump up that figure a bit. The Enyaq is nice to drive – quiet, quick when you want it to be – but EVs do make you drive slowly. It’s all about the range. Because I’m new to this, I didn’t do any planning, like where to spend the night. So I spent my first in the car, in a car park on the outskirts of Gloucester, a little Nomadland re-enactment. Here, I cannot recommend the Enyaq. Although the back seats fold down to make quite a big space, there is an annoying step, so I end up reclining the front passenger seat, like on an overnight flight (remember them?). Back on the M5, then the M6, and more encounters. In Carlisle, I meet Anne-Marie from Newcastle, who is having a weekend away from the kids to go swimming in Ullswater. She loves her five-year-old Nissan Leaf, but gets a range of only 80 miles, so she is stopping off to charge. She drives to work and used to spend £175 a month on diesel in her old Audi; now it’s more like £25 on charging. But she is starting a new job next week, 85 miles away from home, so Anne-Marie needs to get a new car. What is she going to get? A new-generation Leaf. At Gretna, I meet Sarah and Phil from Sheffield, on the way to Hamilton races, although they are going to miss the first race because they are having problems charging their Jaguar I-Pace. The charger at home was tripping all the circuits in the house, so they had to have that fixed. “Then trying to find a superfast charger when you’re out and about is not always possible, because they don’t always work,” says Sarah. Phil says too many companies offer charging: “It should have been three or four franchises from the government and it should have all gone on one app.” It’s a common complaint: that the charging infrastructure is confusing and frustrating – some are fast, others slow, some require an app (EV drivers have screens full of apps), some don’t work at all. My own experience reflects this. In Perth, for example, I identify a BP Pulse point. “Ultra fast charging here,” says the big sign, which, after crossing the Cairngorms, is like reaching an oasis in the desert (I’m limited in my Scottish charging, remember – entirely my own fault). Guess what, though? It doesn’t bloody work. Is it a contactless issue? I download the app, open an account, put £20 on it, try again. The man on the helpline reboots the machine, twice. Still no joy. BP No Pulse, I’m calling it. BP Clinically Dead. If you’re reading, BP Pulse, you owe me £20. I have more joy from Ionity round the corner (I soon learn that you always need a backup). That said, on the way back, at the same place, I have problems with the payment and the woman on the helpline gives me a charge on the house. This happens twice on my trip. It’s my No 1 EV tip: always call the hotline. In short, while the physical infrastructure might be there, it’s not quite functioning in an anxiety-free way. I have quickly become part of the EV community – well intentioned and mostly friendly, but a tiny bit dull. We chat as we charge: about our range, about our favourite and least favourite charging companies. We mostly use the Zap-Maps app, which shows where all the charging points are and lets us plan. There isn’t a lot of room for spontaneity with an EV. A sign to Alton Towers? The Lakes? Or Stirling Castle … No waytime for a visit, because it would mean leaving the route, messing with the plan. Thelma and Louise II: The EV Sequel is going to be a very different and, I think, inferior movie. But hey, I’m feeling good about saving the planet. I have no emissions coming from my tailpipe – I don’t even have one. Of course, my electricity has to be generated somehow. Currently, that is about 43% renewable in the UK and going up all the time. Plus, the car has to be made and maintained – and there are issues about the mining of lithium and cobalt for batteries. It’s not perfect, but EVs are better than petrol or diesel cars. The sale of hybrids will also end in 2030 – or 2035 if they can travel a significant, yet-to-be-decided distance with zero tailpipe emissions. When we got a new car (not new-new) a year or so ago, we thought about getting an electric one. But, like 35% of the country’s drivers, we have no off-street parking; we wouldn’t be able to plug in at home. This, says King, is the area that most needs to be addressed. He mentions lamp-post charge points, already available in some places, ducts that go under pavements, empty office blocks where local people could come and charge up cheaply at night. It is getting better – and will continue to do so. But then I speak to Prof Mike Berners-Lee at Lancaster University, a carbon footprint expert and the author of How Bad Are Bananas?. You know those stingers – the spike strips that the police use to stop cars by puncturing their tyres? Well, Berners-Lee throws one of them across my path – metaphorically speaking, not across the actual A9. He mentions the burden that the huge increase in EVs will have on the power grid. “If you look at the marginal demand for electricity, it’s not met through extra renewables – that capacity is met through gas.” Boo. The surge in electric cars might make it harder for the grid to decarbonise. “It’s not going to put up solar panels and wind turbines faster – we’re already doing that foot to the floor, and this country has a limited capacity for all that, anyway.” Cipcigan at Cardiff University agrees that the EV revolution will be challenging to the grid, but argues that it will also offer opportunities. She mentions charging that doesn’t affect the grid in the evening, and how EVs could help with one of the issues with solar – when there is too much power on sunny days. “Electric vehicles could charge in those periods, use up the extra generated. This service could be offered to fleets and vans.” Berners-Lee isn’t against electric cars – he has just got himself a seven-year-old Renault Zoe. The need for road transport to stop using fossil fuels has never been greater. But he is not convinced that electric was the right way to go. I think I know what is coming: the H word. One of the problems with electricity is that it can’t be produced very far from where it’s needed. Hydrogen, by contrast, could be manufactured using solar power, in the Australian desert, say, then compressed and transported to where it needs to go. “There’s less environmental burden than from batteries, quicker charging time, a smaller re-engineering job on the cars themselves [a hydrogen combustion engine isn’t so different from a petrol one], and it allows us to get some of our primary energy from thousands of miles away.” In the race between E and H on the road to transport decarbonisation, maybe the wrong car got ahead. “Elon Musk has won the argument. But he is promoting space tourism, which is the most ridiculous unnecessary thing you could think of,” says Berners-Lee. Another reason to hate Teslas. Certainly, he says, hydrogen makes sense with bigger vehicles – vans and lorries, where a battery would have to be way too big. But none of this is helping me right now. One day, the Alsop Transport Services lorry in front of me will hopefully run on hydrogen. But that infrastructure certainly isn’t there. And I’m in an electric car, possibly feeling a bit less smug about it, but mainly still anxious about whether I’m going to make it to my destination. I spend another night in the car, in a fishing village 50 miles short of John o’Groats. To the people of Helmsdale, I apologise for my alarm, which kept going off throughout the night; the car thought I was stealing it, from the inside. In the early morning, I set off on the final leg, gently milking the Enyaq’s battery of its remaining charge. No lorry today, but the terrain gets flatter, the anxiety eases and it becomes clear that I’m probably going to make it. Which I do, with six miles to spare. I’ve done 231 miles since the last charge in Perth, 843 miles from Land’s End, about 290kWh in total, if that means anything to you, which has cost me about £88. Charging at home, at low tariff rates, would have been much less. There is another signpost for picture opportunities at John o’Groats: nothing to pay, no queue, oystercatchers instead of gulls. And, best of all, a working EV charger."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/sep/20/the-observer-view-on-boris-johnsons-environmentalism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-20T05:00:36Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Boris Johnson's environmentalism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/20/the-observer-view-on-boris-johnsons-environmentalism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/20/the-observer-view-on-boris-johnsons-environmentalism","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Boris Johnson's environmentalism","bodyText":"Much has been made of Boris Johnson’s purported green credentials. They are in his blood, it is claimed. His father is an environmentalist, he says, while his brother Leo is a sustainability expert. At Oxford he even introduced himself as “a green Tory”, it was alleged in the Times last week. It sounds impressive, though it remains to be seen how well Johnson’s passion for protecting the environment and for combatting climate change will serve him over the next few weeks. His green badge of honour faces a testing time. First on this agenda is the setting fire to British peatlands, an issue that we highlight in today’s Observer. Peat bogs are burned to encourage the growth of new heather shoots and so maximise the availability of food for grouse. It is good for the grouse (until the shooting starts) but bad for the environment. Our peatlands hold about 400m tonnes of carbon, according to the RSPB, and burning these reserves releases plumes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It also destroys lichens and mosses and plays havoc with the habitats of waders and otters. The government’s Committee on Climate Change says peat burning should be halted and the environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, agrees. However, the move is being blocked by the environment secretary, George Eustice, who is keen to protect grouse estates that would otherwise have fewer birds to shoot and so lose business. It is an unedifying spectacle in which privilege, as exemplified by the owners of shooting estates and by those who pay to kill grouse there, has used its influence to help halt action urgently needed to help the UK cut its carbon emission. It is only one of many other environmental headaches that lie ahead for our prime minister, however. Next year, Britain will host one of the most important international summits ever staged. In November, in Glasgow, delegates will gather for the Cop26 climate meeting to debate how different nations will introduce strict emission cuts in order to implement the 2015 Paris agreement, which aims to keep global warming at a relatively safe level. That concordant has been under constant attack by Donald Trump who claims it is “ridiculous and extremely expensive” and harmful to industry. Johnson has uttered not a single word of defence against this invective despite the fact it is intended to undermine the summit Britain will be hosting. Johnson has a duty to do all he can to ensure Cop26 succeeds. His silence is an ominous warning that he does not accept such responsibility and is more interested in appeasing Trump. The government’s position over environmental concerns has been further undermined by the recent decision to appoint the Australian climate sceptic Tony Abbott as a UK trade ambassador. The move has provoked a furious reaction with the UK’s former climate chief Claire O’Neill – who was sacked by Johnson earlier this year – describing the move as “a particularly bad decision” that erodes government claims to support green causes. Last week, the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi announced it was abandoning plans to build a new £20bn nuclear power station at Wylfa in Anglesey. The reactor would have supplied 6% of Britain’s electricity and should have played a key role in replacing the nation’s network of ageing atom plants without building new oil or gas power stations. Britain once planned to build up to six new nuclear plants to provide the nation with electricity – alongside wind and solar power plants – in the 21st century. Today only one is under construction, Hinkley Point C, which is currently running almost £3bn over budget. Nuclear power plants are expensive, with high front-end construction costs, and that often leads to projects being axed. Nevertheless, the shrinkage of UK nuclear aspirations has not arrived abruptly. Plant cancellations have been accruing over the past decade with little sign that the government appreciates the impending crisis. Now it has arrived. It remains to be seen how Johnson will deal with it. These grim tidings arrive at a time when it has become very clear we face a real chance of having to live with an unstable, overheated climate. Last week five separate tropical cyclones developed over the Atlantic for only the second time in history; wildfires continued to devastate Oregon and California; while summer Arctic sea ice coverage has reached its second-lowest level on record. All these events are linked to global heating caused by continued increases in fossil fuel consumption. We urgently need to end this addiction. In the past, Britain has played a key role in the battle against climate change but our influence has waned and we look increasingly isolated and ineffective as an international player. This point was underlined last week when the EU and China concluded a leaders’ conference at which they agreed to establish a high-level environment and climate dialogue to pursue ambitious joint commitments to help combat global warming. Thanks to Brexit – which was so energetically pursued by Johnson – the UK was not involved in those talks. Government sources say Johnson is planning to make a major speech on the environment in the next few weeks and is expected to unveil a vision of how to “build back green” after the coronavirus crisis has abated. Given the catalogue of green bungles and lost opportunities that have unfolded during his premiership, his words should make interesting reading."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2020/mar/13/amazon-indigenous-group-turns-to-solar-canoes-in-fight-against-rainforest-oil-extraction","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-13T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"Here comes the sun canoe, as Amazonians take on Big Oil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/amazon-indigenous-group-turns-to-solar-canoes-in-fight-against-rainforest-oil-extraction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/mar/13/amazon-indigenous-group-turns-to-solar-canoes-in-fight-against-rainforest-oil-extraction","fields":{"headline":"Here comes the sun canoe, as Amazonians take on Big Oil","bodyText":"A canoe slides noiselessly upstream through a landscape of luminous bright clouds reflected in the water. A team of young indigenous people are onboard. Such vessels are an essential and ubiquitous part of life in the Ecuadorian Amazon, but this one boasts a hugely symbolic difference from its predecessors. It is powered by the sun. The nine members of the Achuar indigenous group on board are returning home after learning about solar power and installation. It is a technological development they hope to use in their battle with a more traditional power source that threatens their very existence. Oil. “They have sold us out, they have sold our resources,” says Nantu, 31, referring to the authorities in Quito. “And they are expanding the oil wells. They are stealing from us without us noticing. That’s why we are now standing up, to defend what’s ours, our territories, our way of life.” Ecuador’s oil industry has wrought tremendous disruption and destruction on the peoples of the Amazon rainforest. It is not just the pollution, heavy machinery and deforestation. It is roads as well. A highway that starts in the town of Puyo has already penetrated dozens of kilometres into the territory of the neighbouring Shuar indigenous group, and it is about to enter Achuar territory. “The road is a poison,” says José, Nantu’s companion. “The road doesn’t respect us. It’s been imposed on us from the city. It’s a very dangerous territory for us.” The solar canoes are a defiant attempt to stand up to this incursion. The project, conceived by the Quito-based Kara Solar Foundation, aims to connect nine communities in Achuar territory with public transport powered by the sun. The project envisages an Amazon teeming with solar canoes that will potentially replace the tens of thousands of vessels that burn thousands cubic metres of fuel each year. As Kara Solar’s founder, Oliver Utne, puts it: “Sustained and truly intercultural collaborations can create technological solutions that serve indigenous communities, rather than destroying them.” Ecuador’s oil industry pumps about 500,000 barrels a day, most of it extracted from reserves in the Amazon rainforest. The oil is then piped to the coast and shipped thousands of miles north for refining. Much is sold for export, but some is transported back to Ecuador and driven by road back to petrol stations. From there it is poured into drums and transported in trucks or cars to to be used in canoes that in turn are propelled by two- or four-stroke outboard engines or smaller long-tailed engines known locally as peque-peques. The oil goes back into the rainforest from where it was extracted as pollution. The solar canoes are an attempt to forge an alternative. As with any research project, the two boats in operation have had technical problems and there have been accidents in the tricky territory. The river floods periodically and there are often currents, whirlpools and underwater obstacles to overcome. The surface of the canoe’s solar panel needs to be optimised so that it can carry the greatest number of photovoltaic cells without endangering the vessel’s stability. The durability and storage capacity of the batteries also need to be improved, to make them lighter and ideally to replace the lead with lithium without increasing the cost. There is a long list of other improvements that are needed, but the process is well under way. During the next phase of development, solar recharging stations will be installed along the canoe route. Seven young Achuar people are being trained in using the technology. These are “intercultural training” programmes taught by peers, who are also instructed by indigenous technicians. Concerned about the future of a growing population, the Achuar community is gradually diversifying economically in terms of moving beyond self-sufficiency toward sustainability. There is already an ecotourism project where as many as 24 people can stay in two cabins managed by the community, and a balanced food project that uses a solar power plant. The main and imminent threat, however, is undoubtedly the proximity of the road. Nantu makes a very clear complaint to the authorities in Quito: “I would tell the government not to carry out projects without consulting the indigenous peoples. They should carry out projects in consultation with the people, who are the owners of the territories. They should stop expanding oil frontiers and the arteries that reach the outer corners of the Amazon. It’s becoming very dangerous for us.” Nantu is aware that changes are taking place in the climate and of how global heating affects the territory and the world. “There is some variation of life here in the jungle. The flowering cycle has changed by one to two months. The rains are too intense, and the sun is too strong.” He has a vision for the future of his five children. He imagines an Amazon capable of being economically self-sufficient, a few community tourism centres managed by indigenous people and solar canoes managed by the Achuar with recharging stations along the river. No roads, no pipelines, no oil.

Halfway through our Zoom interview, I tilt my camera to adjust to the setting sun – but from this new angle, an e-commerce box can be spotted over my shoulder. Its barcode glows in the fading light, a totem of 21st-century materialism presiding over our call. MacKinnon is too polite to say anything, but he can’t be thrilled by my cardboard companion. After all, the Canadian bestselling author and journalist is on a mission to get us to buy a lot less stuff. The Day the World Stops Shopping, his new book, explores what might happen if the world transformed into a society that does not revolve around purchasing, one in which our primary role is not as consumers and our credit cards are not our most commonly deployed tools. His “thought experiment” plays out like a Ridley Scott sci-fi epic – or perhaps a scene from the pandemic. On the hypothetical day the world stops shopping, carbon emissions plummet; the skies turn a deeper blue; and with no ads polluting smartphone screens our minds become as clear as the bottle-free oceans in which whales swim merrily. There’s also chaos. Shops shut, production lines grind to a halt and millions of factory workers lose their jobs. The global economy nosedives so severely it makes the 2008 recession seem like a blip. “It would be a shock so great that it would seem to bend time itself,” MacKinnon writes. The only thing fantastical about his vision is the timeframe: rather than ceasing all shopping overnight he thinks we should, in reality, restructure society over several years to support a sustained reduction in the amount we consume. He sees this as an obvious, if difficult, fix to a big problem. Consumption – of fast fashion, flights, Black Friday-discounted gadgets – has become the primary driver of ecological crisis. We are devouring the planet’s resources at a rate 1.7 times faster than it can regenerate. The US population is 60% larger than it was in 1970, but consumer spending is up 400% (adjusted for inflation) – and other rich nations, including the UK, aren’t much better. “Many people would like to see the world consume fewer resources, yet we constantly avoid the most obvious means of achieving that,” says MacKinnon. “When people buy less stuff, you get immediate drops in emissions, resource consumption and pollution, unlike anything we’ve achieved with green technology.” That’s not to mention the impact materialism has on our mental health, inducing feelings of inadequacy and envy, and encouraging a culture of overworking. His is an impassioned call to arms, for the sake of our planet and our wellbeing. But how feasible is it for all the world’s citizens to swap Amazon baskets for a simple agrarian life? More pointedly, do we want to? Does MacKinnon’s vision represent an enlightened Shangri-La – or a primitive dystopia? “This is the best opportunity in the past 30 years to bring consumption back to the centre of the political discourse,” says MacKinnon, speaking from his home in Vancouver. He’s pensive, with piercing blue eyes. Indeed, the pandemic has given people pause to think about “how they consume, what their relationship with stuff should look like and what is deeply valuable in their lives,” he says. “I don’t think anybody is going to say that having a bunch of home-workout gear was as satisfying as being able to have contact with friends, family and neighbours.” Many of us still shopped – Amazon enjoyed record-breaking global revenues of $386bn in 2020 – but, stripped of opportunities for parading possessions in front of others, there was a widespread rethink in why we buy and wear things. “For women, particularly, the idea that they don’t constantly have to be messaging and positioning through their dress was interesting,” he says. “Women saying they’re never going to wear jeans or bras again – these are interesting individual reckonings.” Nonetheless, as much of the world begins to reopen, there are rallying cries to boost the economy by opening our wallets. Shopping has been cast as a positive act, retail therapy a civic duty. “All the narratives are building around a new Roaring 20s, a hedonistic binge, taking revenge on the virus with our consumption,” says MacKinnon. “But I think a lot of us are going to feel uncomfortable and disquieted, to the point of despair, as we remember what the fully revved-up consumer culture looks like.” He wants us to act on that discomfort. But he’s not suggesting we live entirely off the land. In his hypothetical model he applies a 25% reduction in consumption – a figure “modest enough to be possible, dramatic enough to be earth-shattering” – and while he won’t specify a figure when discussing what our real-world efforts should be in the coming years, something in this ballpark might well be the goal. That doesn’t just mean fewer physical things; it’s also less electricity, travel and eating out. “Basically $1 spent is a consumption dollar; I’m not fussed whether it’s spent on a canoe or a powerboat,” he says. “If you want a rule of thumb for how much impact you’re having as a consumer, the best one is: how much money are you spending? If it’s increasing, you’re probably increasing your impact; if it’s lowering, you’re probably lowering your impact.” How might a lower-consuming society look? Everything is reoriented because people, brands and governments are no longer striving for economic growth. Individuals are more self-sufficient, growing food, mending things and embracing wabi-sabi, the Japanese concept of imperfect aesthetics (think patched-up pockets or chipped ceramics). Brands produce fewer but better-quality goods, while governments ban planned obsolescence (the practice of producing items to only function for a set period of time), stick “durability” labels on items so shoppers can be assured of longevity, and introduce tax subsidies so it’s cheaper to repair something than to bin it and buy a new version. Why has such an approach never before been attempted on a broad, society-wide scale? MacKinnon rejects my suggestion that perhaps consumerism is hard-wired into human nature, but says it is “deeply ingrained” in society and it’s “much easier for us to think, ‘Let’s make all these cars run on solar power instead of gas,’ rather than, ‘How do we end up with fewer cars?’” Plus, he says, “to some extent there was a point where we gave in to the idea that lowering consumption could not be a solution, because it inevitably results in economic collapse.” Well, doesn’t it? Were we all to stop shopping overnight it would be disastrous, he admits, but if we built a new system, it could support a surprisingly robust economy. “If you’re producing durable goods, you still need considerable labour. Then there’s the secondhand market, the repair of products, taking items back in and recomposing them into new products,” he says. “Whether it adds up to an economy the size of the one we have today, I doubt it,” he continues, adding, with a wry smile: “I mean, I don’t see a lot of billion-dollar IPOs coming out of the drive towards a lower-consuming society.” But that’s kind of the point. “It would be a problem if it generated as much wealth – because ultimately, the reason we feel we need to be awash in wealth is to consume. Otherwise, what’s it for?” Although MacKinnon imagines most of us will still be employed in the cash economy, in the new world order the hours will be shorter and the work often more satisfying because we’ll be “participating in the production of higher-quality goods.” With a smaller pot of jobs and money, some people will choose not to work and governments will provide universal basic income and/or services. Although MacKinnon avoids referencing specific anti-capitalist political systems, when pushed he agrees it looks like socialism – although “there’s probably all kinds of different ways you can organise society around principles of lower consumption, none of which I think necessarily exists right now.” Most importantly, being freed from the corporate rat-race means our work-life balance shifts. We compare ourselves less to others and have more time away from screens. This change, rather than concern for the environment (“‘Saving the planet’ has always been a bit abstract”), is what he thinks will be most compelling to most people. We participate in communal activities, such as tending public gardens, engage in social movements and take care of children and elders. “It’s the balance most of us seem to want, right? More time to engage with friends and family and to have long conversations. There are lots of opportunities, I think, for people to genuinely feel they have a higher quality of life.” Over the decades various communities have practised “voluntary simplicity,” whether by choice or necessity. For the book, MacKinnon visited, among other places, sleepy Sado Island in the Sea of Japan; a farming community outside Tokyo; and the suburbs of Seattle where, since the 1990s, many folks have embraced “downshifting” in reaction to the city’s conquest by the moneyed tech crowd (the most widespread rejection of consumer culture in recent times). In general, these people buy few clothes, read library books, walk or catch buses, avoid social media and rarely listen to music or watch TV. When I ask MacKinnon whether he noticed anything distinctive about them his face lights up. “Talking to somebody working in corporate America versus somebody who’s been practising voluntary simplicity for three decades is night and day, in terms of the kind of human being they are. It makes you want to be the voluntary simplicity person very much,” he says. “They make time for people and have more depth and generosity of spirit. At times, it did feel like I was talking to a more evolved being.” Such lifestyles sound very worthy, I say, but also a tad… unfun? Needless to say, I am not an evolved being and I cringe as I realise how shallow I sound. Yet in my former job as a fashion editor, I have seen consumerism at its most seductive. And the first place I visited once lockdown lifted was Selfridges – possibly London’s shiniest temple to materialism – to marvel at the displays. It’s undeniable that consumerism brings bright lights, dazzling outfits and lively nights out. MacKinnon gamely fields the query. “I think there’s a grain of truth in it,” he says. “That’s the reality we need to confront, to some extent. We’re certainly not talking about a return to the Stone Age, but maybe we have to accept that a lower-consuming society isn’t an endless parade of distractions like the society we have today.” Getting people to believe that this can be a satisfying existence will be the biggest hurdle. “When what you’ve known throughout your lifetime is what satisfaction you can draw from a consumeristic materialistic society, it’s very hard to imagine there’s an alternative that’s going to work as well or better,” he says. “But there is.” He points to an uplifting case study from London. In Barking and Dagenham, one of the city’s poorest boroughs, the “Every One. Every Day” initiative brings together locals to cook, partake in poetry, craft and hair-braiding sessions, and spruce up common areas, all of it free. “For many of the people participating, it’s deeply engaging and profoundly affecting,” he says. “In a lot of places, if you don’t have the cash to consume, there’s nothing to do; the closest I came to tears in researching this book was watching people who were feeling isolated and excluded from consumer culture have an alternative put in front of them. That points towards the potential.” Although a “cloak-and-dagger” culture still enshrouds talk about reducing consumption in most corporate environments – various interviewees would only speak to MacKinnon anonymously – there are some promising signs. Trailblazing brands such as Patagonia and Levi’s have made impressive strides in encouraging customers to question throwaway culture and “buy less but better” is becoming a more common refrain in parts of the fashion industry (even as the industry continues to grow exponentially). Perhaps the book’s most startling comment comes from Abdullah al Maher, the CEO of a Bangladesh knitwear firm that produces for fast-fashion giants including H&amp;M and Zara. He admits that transitioning to a lower-consuming society would be painful for his country: its 6,000 clothing factories would probably halve. But in this new system, the factories would provide better wages, pollute less and compete on quality instead of speed. “There’ll be no ratrace then,” Maher says, adding: “You know, it wouldn’t be so bad.” It’s a striking statement from a powerful businessman in a nation that is a factory for the world. And it’s the sort of comment that gives MacKinnon confidence. “I’m hopeful that, coming out of the pandemic, people are going to have discussions that start to move the idea of reducing consumption back into the public discourse, from the fringes where it’s been for three decades,” he says. Such conversations will involve tossing up whether we’re prepared to give up our vibrant, high-velocity, acquisitive lives in order to calm our minds and save the earth. Although we might not like the answer, and change is always uncomfortable, it’s tough to argue that there’s even a contest.

But the hardest year, perhaps, that many of us will have experienced has also brought some startling achievements, positive consequences and uplifting moments – a few flashes of light in the gloom. Solidarity surges in time of Covid: humans, take a bow 2020 was undoubtedly the year when the volunteer society mobilised like never before. Record numbers of people responded to the sudden crisis in their local communities: delivering essential food, medicines and personal protective equipment; transporting patients to hospital; supporting testing and contact tracing; and providing social and psychological support to vulnerable and quarantined people. According to the Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian aid organisations, 78,000 new volunteers signed up to help in the US; in Italy the figure was nearly 60,000. There were 48,000 in the Netherlands and 35,000 in Kenya. In Tuvalu, a country with no recorded cases of Covid-19, the local Red Cross welcomed 130 new volunteers. “In response to unprecedented humanitarian need, we have witnessed equally unprecedented humanity and kindness,” said Francesco Rocca, the president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. “Though the future can seem bleak and the world divided because of this virus, every individual action of solidarity, of peace, of lending a hand and supporting your community counts.” Female leaders really did do better Countries led by women had “systematically and significantly better” Covid-19 outcomes during the first wave of the pandemic, locking down earlier and suffering half as many deaths on average as those led by men. An analysis of 194 countries by two academics, Supriya Garikipati, of Liverpool University, and Reading University’s Uma Kambhampati, suggested the difference “may be explained by the proactive and coordinated policy responses” adopted by female leaders such as Germany’s Angela Merkel, New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern, Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen, Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-wen and Finland’s Sanna Marin. The study examined policy responses and Covid-19 cases and deaths until 19 May, adjusting for variables such as GDP, total population, population density and proportion of elderly residents as well as annual health spending per head and level of gender equality. “When women-led countries are compared to countries similar to them along a range of characteristics, they have performed better, experiencing fewer cases as well as fewer deaths,” Garikipati said. Science delivered with a promising new kind of vaccine Conventional vaccines often take a decade or more to develop (a 1960s Merck mumps jab holds the record: four years); two coronavirus vaccines, both effective to about 95%, took just 300 days. Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna designed a molecule called messenger RNA or mRNA which, injected into cells, instructs them to make the proteins usually found in the virus, stimulating an immune response from the body. Rollout has already started, and though vaccinating almost 8 billion people will be a medical challenge unparalleled in human history, the breakthrough has certainly raised hopes that 2021 will be a better year than its predecessor. Although the technology had been in development for some years, mRNA vaccines had never before been licensed for use in humans. One big advantage is that they can be made fast: it’s a chemical process, with no need to grow proteins or viruses. But this also needs a whole new technology that, suitably refined, could change forever how medicine fights not just viruses but inherited diseases and maybe even cancer. These are early days, but the leap forward looks real and the signs are promising. 2020 was a record year for renewable energy Global renewable electricity installation hit record levels in 2020 – unlike the fossil fuel sector, which was hit hard by the pandemic. According to the International Energy Agency, almost 90% of new electricity generation in 2020 was renewable, with just 10% powered by gas and coal. Solar power capacity has increased by 18 times since 2010 and wind power by four times, the agency said, predicting that green electricity could overtake coal to become the world’s largest power source by 2025. The IEA said growing acceptance of the need to tackle the climate crisis by cutting carbon emissions was making renewable energy increasingly attractive to investors. “Renewable power is defying the difficulties caused by the pandemic, showing robust growth while others fuels struggle,” said the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol. Cities seized the chance to make more space for people and bikes The pandemic acted as a catalyst for urban transformation, with authorities in many cities around the world seizing on spring lockdowns to reclaim the streets for pedestrians and cyclists. The Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said it was “out of the question” to return to pre-Covid traffic and pollution levels, opening about 20 miles of new bike lanes, announcing plans for another 30, and sealing off a major east-west artery, the Rue de Rivoli, to private cars. Fourteen miles of new bike lanes appeared in Berlin, Athens and Dublin made major swathes of the city “car-unfriendly”, Milan turned 22 miles of street into cycle and footpaths, Rome approved 93 miles of temporary and permanent cycle routes, and cities from Brussels to Sydney and Bogotá to California took similar steps. Barcelona opened 18 miles of new cycle lanes and 7.5 of new pavement, eliminated 1,300 parking spaces and unveiled an ambitious 10-year plan to turn one in three streets in its central Eixample district into “green zones” with priority for pedestrians and cyclists. Local politicians stepped up to the Covid challenge They may have spent much of the year in survival mode, but that did not stop local politicians from across Europe coming up with innovative projects to save lives, protect jobs and make democracy more resilient. Among 400-odd entries from 22 countries in this year’s Innovation in Politics awards were a municipal farm supplying a school canteen in France; a British scheme allocating homeless people an address so they can apply for jobs and access healthcare with the addresses of long-vacant properties; a Dutch project using material from demolished high-rises to build modern homes; a free tax, legal and financial support advice service for struggling local businesses in Poland; and a Slovakian project that built a series of “quarantine towns” – fully-furnished shipping containers with free meals and healthcare visits – for homeless people who had tested positive for Covid-19, did not need hospital treatment, but had nowhere to self-isolate. Fatherhood is reborn In the UK at least, lockdown pushed British dads to undertake far more childcare than in the past, a small victory for gender equality advocates. In May, the Office for National Statistics found that the first Covid lockdown had led to a 58% increase in childcare undertaken by men, offering a tantalising prospect of a profound shift in caring responsibilities. “Research tells us that when there is a social movement happening, a crisis often accelerates the movement,” said Adrienne Burgess, joint chief executive of the Fatherhood Institute. … and so are books Admittedly it was a mixed picture from the publishing world, with physical book sales falling, but a record surge in the volume of ebooks sold in the UK. Fears of a collapse of independent book publishers did not materialise and many managed not just to survive but to thrive. … and teaching While the profession has been tested like never before in 2020, millions of teachers around the world demonstrated their resilience, flexibility, determination and ingenuity in keeping their young charges more or less on track despite unprecedented disruption. Teachers added a new digital string to their bow, with many reporting that their pedagogical skills had been rebooted by the crash course in remote instruction that the entire profession had to undergo in the first half of the year. Like many walks of life, teaching was upended by the pandemic, but will emerge stronger on the other side. What were the other silver linings of 2020?

It’s that we always put our survival first. This is true of other species. When confronted by an impending threat, such as winter, they invest great resources into avoiding or withstanding it: migrating or hibernating, for example. Humans are a different matter. When faced with an impending or chronic threat, such as climate or ecological breakdown, we seem to go out of our way to compromise our survival. We convince ourselves that it’s not so serious, or even that it isn’t happening. We double down on destruction, swapping our ordinary cars for SUVs, jetting to Oblivia on a long-haul flight, burning it all up in a final frenzy. In the back of our minds, there’s a voice whispering, “If it were really so serious, someone would stop us.” If we attend to these issues at all, we do so in ways that are petty, tokenistic, comically ill-matched to the scale of our predicament. It is impossible to discern, in our response to what we know, the primacy of our survival instinct. Here is what we know. We know that our lives are entirely dependent on complex natural systems: the atmosphere, ocean currents, the soil, the planet’s webs of life. People who study complex systems have discovered that they behave in consistent ways. It doesn’t matter whether the system is a banking network, a nation state, a rainforest or an Antarctic ice shelf; its behaviour follows certain mathematical rules. In normal conditions, the system regulates itself, maintaining a state of equilibrium. It can absorb stress up to a certain point. But then it suddenly flips. It passes a tipping point, then falls into a new state of equilibrium, which is often impossible to reverse. Human civilisation relies on current equilibrium states. But, all over the world, crucial systems appear to be approaching their tipping points. If one system crashes, it is likely to drag others down, triggering a cascade of chaos known as systemic environmental collapse. This is what happened during previous mass extinctions. Here’s one of the many ways in which it could occur. A belt of savannah, known as the Cerrado, covers central Brazil. Its vegetation depends on dew forming, which depends in turn on deep-rooted trees drawing up groundwater, then releasing it into the air through their leaves. But over the past few years, vast tracts of the Cerrado have been cleared to plant crops – mostly soya to feed the world’s chickens and pigs. As the trees are felled, the air becomes drier. This means smaller plants die, ensuring that even less water is circulated. In combination with global heating, some scientists warn, this vicious cycle could – soon and suddenly – flip the entire system into desert. The Cerrado is the source of some of South America’s great rivers, including those flowing north into the Amazon basin. As less water feeds the rivers, this could exacerbate the stress afflicting the rainforests. They are being hammered by a deadly combination of clearing, burning and heating, and are already threatened with possible systemic collapse. The Cerrado and the rainforest both create “rivers in the sky” – streams of wet air – that distribute rainfall around the world and help to drive global circulation: the movement of air and ocean currents. Global circulation is already looking vulnerable. For example, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which delivers heat from the tropics towards the poles, is being disrupted by the melting of Arctic ice, and has begun to weaken. Without it, the UK would have a climate similar to Siberia’s. AMOC has two equilibrium states: on and off. It has been on for almost 12,000 years, following a devastating, thousand-year off state called the Younger Dryas (12,900 to 11,700 years ago), which caused a global spiral of environmental change. Everything we know and love depends on AMOC remaining in the on state. Regardless of which complex system is being studied, there’s a way of telling whether it is approaching a tipping point. Its outputs begin to flicker. The closer to its critical threshold it comes, the wilder the fluctuations. What we’ve seen this year is a great global flickering, as Earth systems begin to break down. The heat domes over the western seaboard of North America; the massive fires there, in Siberia and around the Mediterranean; the lethal floods in Germany, Belgium, China, Sierra Leone – these are the signals that, in climatic morse code, spell “mayday”. You might expect an intelligent species to respond to these signals swiftly and conclusively, by radically altering its relationship with the living world. But this is not how we function. Our great intelligence, our highly evolved consciousness that once took us so far, now works against us. *** An analysis by the media sustainability group Albert found that “cake” was mentioned 10 times as often as “climate change” on UK TV programmes in 2020. “Scotch egg” received double the mentions of “biodiversity”. “Banana bread” beat “wind power” and “solar power” put together. I recognise that the media are not society, and that television stations have an interest in promoting banana bread and circuses. We could argue about the extent to which the media are either reflecting or generating an appetite for cake over climate. But I suspect that, of all the ways in which we might measure our progress on preventing systemic environmental collapse, the cake-to-climate ratio is the decisive index. The current ratio reflects a determined commitment to irrelevance in the face of global catastrophe. Tune in to almost any radio station, at any time, and you can hear the frenetic distraction at work. While around the world wildfires rage, floods sweep cars from the streets and crops shrivel, you will hear a debate about whether to sit down or stand up while pulling on your socks, or a discussion about charcuterie boards for dogs. I’m not making up these examples: I stumbled across them while flicking between channels on days of climate disaster. If an asteroid were heading towards Earth, and we turned on the radio, we’d probably hear: “So the hot topic today is – what’s the funniest thing that’s ever happened to you while eating a kebab?” This is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with banter. Faced with crises on an unprecedented scale, our heads are filled with insistent babble. The trivialisation of public life creates a loop: it becomes socially impossible to talk about anything else. I’m not suggesting that we should discuss only the impending catastrophe. I’m not against bants. What I’m against is nothing but bants. It’s not just on the music and entertainment channels that this deadly flippancy prevails. Most political news is nothing but court gossip: who’s in, who’s out, who said what to whom. It studiously avoids what lies beneath: the dark money, the corruption, the shift of power away from the democratic sphere, the gathering environmental collapse that makes a nonsense of its obsessions. I’m sure it’s not deliberate. I don’t think anyone, faced with the prospect of systemic environmental collapse, is telling themselves: “Quick, let’s change the subject to charcuterie boards for dogs.” It works at a deeper level than this. It’s a subconscious reflex that tells us more about ourselves than our conscious actions do. The chatter on the radio sounds like the distant signals from a dying star. *** There are some species of caddisfly whose survival depends on breaking the surface film of the water in a river. The female pushes through it – no mean feat for such a small and delicate creature – then swims down the water column to lay her eggs on the riverbed. If she cannot puncture the surface, she cannot close the circle of life, and her progeny die with her. This is also the human story. If we cannot pierce the glassy surface of distraction, and engage with what lies beneath, we will not secure the survival of our children or, perhaps, our species. But we seem unable or unwilling to break the surface film. I think of this strange state as our “surface tension”. It’s the tension between what we know about the crisis we face, and the frivolity with which we distance ourselves from it. Surface tension dominates even when we claim to be addressing the destruction of our life-support systems. We focus on what I call micro-consumerist bollocks (MCB): tiny issues such as plastic straws and coffee cups, rather than the huge structural forces driving us towards catastrophe. We are obsessed with plastic bags. We believe we’re doing the world a favour by buying tote bags instead, though, on one estimate, the environmental impact of producing an organic cotton tote bag is equivalent to that of 20,000 plastic ones. We are rightly horrified by the image of a seahorse with its tail wrapped around a cotton bud, but apparently unconcerned about the elimination of entire marine ecosystems by the fishing industry. We tut and shake our heads, and keep eating our way through the life of the sea. A company called Soletair Power receives wide media coverage for its claim to be “fighting climate change” by catching the carbon dioxide exhaled by office workers. But its carbon-sucking unit – an environmentally costly tower of steel and electronics – extracts just 1kg of carbon dioxide every eight hours. Humanity produces, mostly by burning fossil fuels, roughly 32bn kg of CO2 in the same period. I don’t believe our focus on microscopic solutions is accidental, even if it is unconscious. All of us are expert at using the good things we do to blot out the bad things. Rich people can persuade themselves they’ve gone green because they recycle, while forgetting that they have a second home (arguably the most extravagant of all their assaults on the living world, as another house has to be built to accommodate the family they’ve displaced). And I suspect that, in some deep, unlit recess of the mind, we assure ourselves that if our solutions are so small, the problem can’t be so big. I’m not saying the small things don’t matter. I’m saying they should not matter to the exclusion of things that matter more. Every little counts. But not for very much. *** Our focus on MCB aligns with the corporate agenda. The deliberate effort to stop us seeing the bigger picture began in 1953 with a campaign called Keep America Beautiful. It was founded by packaging manufacturers, motivated by the profits they could make by replacing reusable containers with disposable plastic. Above all, they wanted to sink state laws insisting that glass bottles were returned and reused. Keep America Beautiful shifted the blame for the tsunami of plastic trash the manufacturers caused on to “litter bugs”, a term it invented. The “Love Where You Live” campaign, launched in the UK in 2011 by Keep Britain Tidy, Imperial Tobacco, McDonald’s and the sweet manufacturer Wrigley, seemed to me to play a similar role. It had the added bonus – as it featured strongly in classrooms – of granting Imperial Tobacco exposure to schoolchildren. The corporate focus on litter, amplified by the media, distorts our view of all environmental issues. For example, a recent survey of public beliefs about river pollution found that “litter and plastic” was by far the biggest cause people named. In reality, the biggest source of water pollution is farming, followed by sewage. Litter is way down the list. It’s not that plastic is unimportant. The problem is that it’s almost the only story we know. In 2004, the advertising company Ogilvy &amp; Mather, working for the oil giant BP, took this blame-shifting a step further by inventing the personal carbon footprint. It was a useful innovation, but it also had the effect of diverting political pressure from the producers of fossil fuels to consumers. The oil companies didn’t stop there. The most extreme example I’ve seen was a 2019 speech by the chief executive of the oil company Shell, Ben van Beurden. He instructed us to “eat seasonally and recycle more”, and publicly berated his chauffeur for buying a punnet of strawberries in January. The great political transition of the past 50 years, driven by corporate marketing, has been a shift from addressing our problems collectively to addressing them individually. In other words, it has turned us from citizens into consumers. It’s not hard to see why we have been herded down this path. As citizens, joining together to demand political change, we are powerful. As consumers, we are almost powerless. In his book Life and Fate, Vasily Grossman notes that, when Stalin and Hitler were in power, “one of the most astonishing human traits that came to light at this time was obedience”. The instinct to obey, he observed, was stronger than the instinct to survive. Acting alone, seeing ourselves as consumers, fixating on MCB and mind-numbing trivia, even as systemic environmental collapse looms: these are forms of obedience. We would rather face civilisational death than the social embarrassment caused by raising awkward subjects, and the political trouble involved in resisting powerful forces. The obedience reflex is our greatest flaw, the kink in the human brain that threatens our lives. *** What do we see if we break the surface tension? The first thing we encounter, looming out of the depths, should scare us almost out of our wits. It’s called growth. Economic growth is universally hailed as a good thing. Governments measure their success on their ability to deliver it. But think for a moment about what it means. Say we achieve the modest aim, promoted by bodies like the IMF and the World Bank, of 3% global growth a year. This means that all the economic activity you see today – and most of the environmental impacts it causes – doubles in 24 years; in other words, by 2045. Then it doubles again by 2069. Then again by 2093. It’s like the Gemino curse in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, which multiplies the treasure in the Lestrange vault until it threatens to crush Harry and his friends to death. All the crises we seek to avert today become twice as hard to address as global economic activity doubles, then twice again, then twice again. Have we reached the bottom yet? By no means. The Gemino curse is just one outcome of a thing we scarcely dare mention. Just as it was once blasphemous to use the name of God, even the word appears, in polite society, to be taboo: capitalism. Most people struggle to define the system that dominates our lives. But if you press them, they’re likely to mumble something about hard work and enterprise, buying and selling. This is how the beneficiaries of the system want it to be understood. In reality, the great fortunes amassed under capitalism are not obtained this way, but through looting, monopoly and rent grabbing, followed by inheritance. One estimate suggests that, over the course of 200 years, the British extracted from India, at current prices, $45tn. They used this money to fund industrialisation at home and the colonisation of other nations, whose wealth was then looted in turn. The looting takes place not just across geography, but also across time. The apparent health of our economies today depends on seizing natural wealth from future generations. This is what the oil companies, seeking to distract us with MCB and carbon footprints, are doing. Such theft from the future is the motor of economic growth. Capitalism, which sounds so reasonable when explained by a mainstream economist, is in ecological terms nothing but a pyramid scheme. Is this the riverbed? No. Capitalism is just a means by which something even bigger is pursued. Wealth. It scarcely matters how green you think you are. The main cause of your environmental impact isn’t your attitude. It isn’t your mode of consumption. It isn’t the choices you make. It’s your money. If you have surplus money, you spend it. While you might persuade yourself that you are a green mega-consumer, in reality you are just a mega-consumer. This is why the environmental impacts of the very rich, however right-on they may be, are massively greater than those of everyone else. Preventing more than 1.5C of global heating means that our average emissions should be no greater than two tonnes of carbon dioxide per person per year. But the richest 1% of the world’s people produce an average of more than 70 tonnes. Bill Gates, according to one estimate, emits almost 7,500 tonnes of CO2, mostly from flying in his private jets. Roman Abramovich, the same figures suggest, produces almost 34,000 tonnes, largely by running his gigantic yacht. The multiple homes that ultra-rich people own might be fitted with solar panels, their supercars might be electric, their private planes might run on biokerosene, but these tweaks make little difference to the overall impact of their consumption. In some cases, they increase it. The switch to biofuels favoured by Bill Gates is now among the greatest causes of habitat destruction, as forests are felled to produce wood pellets and liquid fuels, and soils are trashed to make biomethane. But more important than the direct impacts of the ultra-wealthy is the political and cultural power with which they block effective change. Their cultural power relies on a hypnotising fairytale. Capitalism persuades us that we are all temporarily embarrassed millionaires. This is why we tolerate it. In reality, some people are extremely rich because others are extremely poor: massive wealth depends on exploitation. And if we did all become millionaires, we would cook the planet in no time at all. But the fairytale of universal wealth, one day, secures our obedience. The difficult truth is that, to prevent climate and ecological catastrophe, we need to level down. We need to pursue what the Belgian philosopher Ingrid Robeyns calls limitarianism. Just as there is a poverty line below which no one should fall, there is a wealth line above which no one should rise. What we need are not carbon taxes, but wealth taxes. It shouldn’t surprise us that ExxonMobil favours a carbon tax. It’s a form of MCB. It addresses only one aspect of the many-headed environmental crisis, while transferring responsibility from the major culprits to everyone. It can be highly regressive, which means that the poor pay more than the rich. But wealth taxes strike at the heart of the issue. They should be high enough to break the spiral of accumulation and redistribute the riches accumulated by a few. They could be used to put us on an entirely different track, one that I call “private sufficiency, public luxury”. While there is not enough ecological or even physical space on Earth for everyone to enjoy private luxury, there is enough to provide everyone with public luxury: magnificent parks, hospitals, swimming pools, art galleries, tennis courts and transport systems, playgrounds and community centres. We should each have our own small domains – private sufficiency – but when we want to spread our wings, we could do so without seizing resources from other people. In consenting to the continued destruction of our life-support systems, we accommodate the desires of the ultra-rich and the powerful corporations they control. By remaining trapped in the surface film, absorbed in frivolity and MCB, we grant them a social licence to operate. We will endure only if we cease to consent. The 19th-century democracy campaigners knew this, the suffragettes knew it, Gandhi knew it, Martin Luther King knew it. The environmental protesters who demand systemic change have also grasped this fundamental truth. In Fridays for Future, Green New Deal Rising, Extinction Rebellion and the other global uprisings against systemic environmental collapse, we see people, mostly young people, refusing to consent. What they understand is history’s most important lesson. Our survival depends on disobedience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/oct/10/solar-powered-drug-tunnel-discovered-on-mexican-border-with-california","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-10T17:24:26Z","webTitle":"Solar-powered drug tunnel discovered on Mexican border with California","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/10/solar-powered-drug-tunnel-discovered-on-mexican-border-with-california","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/oct/10/solar-powered-drug-tunnel-discovered-on-mexican-border-with-california","fields":{"headline":"Solar-powered drug tunnel discovered on Mexican border with California","bodyText":"US and Mexican authorities have discovered an incomplete cross-border drug smuggling tunnel complete with a rail track and a solar-powered lighting and ventilation system. The US border patrol said on Tuesday that the clandestine passage measured 627 feet (191 meters), including 336ft inside US territory, in California. The tunnel builders had started working on an exit shaft north of the border, but had not broken the surface before it was discovered. Mexican police discovered the tunnel on 19 September while searching a home 221ft south of the border, in the town of Jacume, in Baja California state. The border patrol said that a solar panel system had been set up to power lighting and ventilation systems inside the tunnel, which was also equipped with a rail system along its entire length, and two pumps to drain water. Drug smugglers often use tunnels to move their products across the US-Mexico border; dozens have been discovered in recent years – mostly in California and Arizona. The San Diego-Tijuana region is popular because its clay-like soil is relatively easy to dig with shovels and pneumatic tools, and both sides of the border have warehouses that provide cover for trucks and heavy equipment. The strategy was pioneered by the former head of the Sinaloa cartel, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, who is currently awaiting trial in New York. In 2015, Guzmán escaped from a maximum security prison through a hole in his shower floor which lead to a mile-long tunnel equipped with a modified motorcycle on rails. He was recaptured six months later and extradited to the US last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/apr/05/thousands-to-be-paid-for-daytime-green-electricity-use-during-lockdown","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-05T13:33:53Z","webTitle":"Households to be paid for daytime green electricity use during lockdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/05/thousands-to-be-paid-for-daytime-green-electricity-use-during-lockdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/apr/05/thousands-to-be-paid-for-daytime-green-electricity-use-during-lockdown","fields":{"headline":"Households to be paid for daytime green electricity use during lockdown","bodyText":"Thousands of British homes will be paid to use electricity during the day for the first time, as wind and solar projects produce a surge in clean energy during the coronavirus lockdown. On Sunday morning, windfarms contributed almost 40% of the UK’s electricity, while solar power made up almost a fifth of the power system. Fossil fuels made up less than 15% of electricity, of which only 1.1% came from coal plants. Meanwhile, the country’s energy demand has fallen by around 10% due to the shutdown of pubs, restaurants, companies and factories across the country, leading to the lowest electricity market prices in 10 years. Households on a new breed of home energy tariff will even be paid to use electricity during the day on Sunday, because sunny weather and a brisk breeze will help generate ample clean electricity to meet the UK’s lower energy needs. The so-called “negative electricity prices” have previously only been available to homes overnight, when demand is typically at its lowest. But the impact of the coronavirus lockdown and the bright spring weather mean some homes will be able to earn money while using clean electricity during the day for the first time. Households which use the Agile Octopus energy tariff, offered by Octopus Energy, were contacted on Saturday to let them know they would be paid for every kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity they use during the sunniest hours of Sunday afternoon. From 11am-4pm, those customers will earn 0.22p-3.3p per kWh to make use of the UK’s abundant clean energy, the company said. The coronavirus has caused the UK’s demand for electricity to fall by between 9% and 13% so far, according to analysts at Cornwall Insight. While home energy use is higher because people are self-isolating and working from home, the lockdown has led to a lower demand for electricity across the country due to the shutdown of “large electrical loads” such as factories, shops and railways. Energy bill savings are also likely for homes using variable energy tariffs, which track the wholesale energy markets. A slump in global gas market prices over the last year, combined with the lockdown, caused the wholesale price of electricity on the UK power markets to fall to £28 per megawatt hour (MWh) last week. The electricity market price is down a third from January this year and well below the £44/MWh price recorded this time last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/may/27/investment-in-global-energy-to-drop-by-400bn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-27T04:00:20Z","webTitle":"Investment in global energy to drop by $400bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/27/investment-in-global-energy-to-drop-by-400bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/may/27/investment-in-global-energy-to-drop-by-400bn","fields":{"headline":"Investment in global energy to drop by $400bn","bodyText":"Investment in global energy will fall by $400bn (£324bn) this year, the biggest slump in the industry’s history, as the Covid-19 pandemic fuels a collapse in energy demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said the unprecedented investment slump follows the most severe plunge in energy demand since the second world war. The price of oil suffered an historic market crash last month when US oil prices turned negative for the first time. The IEA said the decline in investment is “staggering in both its scale and swiftness” and will impact every major sector, from fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal to renewable sources including wind and solar power. In a report, the IEA said the decline in investment in areas such as clean energy technology could undermine the transition to renewable, sustainable sources of energy. “The crisis has brought lower emissions but for all the wrong reasons,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. “If we are to achieve a lasting reduction in global emissions, then we will need to see a rapid increase in clean energy investment. The slowdown in spending on key clean energy technologies also risks undermining the much-needed transition to more resilient and sustainable energy systems.” The IEA said at the start of the year it forecast global energy investment would rise by 2% in 2020, the biggest annual rise in six years. It is now expected to plummet by 20% year-on-year. Oil accounts for most of the decline as lockdowns and travel curbs across the globe wipe out demand, with investment due to plummet by a third, about $250bn, this year. Investment in shale, already under pressure as debt mounts among fracking companies, will fall by half this year. The IEA said this decline in demand will mark a historic moment, with global consumer spending on oil due to fall below the amount spent on electricity for the first time. The IEA said falling energy demand, lower prices and a rise of non-payment of bills will mean energy revenues going to governments and energy companies will fall by more than $1tn this year. Financially stretched energy companies are cutting costs, including in new and existing energy projects, to fortify balance sheets. Investment in renewable energy has proved to be more resilient than fossil fuels. However, the IEA said that in the first quarter the number of wind and solar projects given the financial go-ahead fell to a three-year low. Spending on rooftop solar panels by homes and businesses has been strongly affected, it said. There will be a 9% decrease in spending on electricity networks this year, a “worrying signal” for the development of more secure and sustainable power systems. The report also said that investment in natural gas plants is stagnating and spending on battery storage is levelling off. Birol said the longer-term knock-on effect of reduced investment could threaten the ability of electricity grids to handle future supply shocks. “Electricity grids have been a vital underpinning of the emergency response to the health crisis, and of economic and social activities that have been able to continue under lockdown,” said Birol. “These networks have to be resilient and smart to ward against future shocks. Today’s investment trends are clear warning signs for future electricity security.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/live/2022/nov/17/cop27-draft-cover-text-published-fears-lack-ambition-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T18:01:19Z","webTitle":"Cop27 president bemoans slow negotiations saying some countries failing to address urgency of climate crisis – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2022/nov/17/cop27-draft-cover-text-published-fears-lack-ambition-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/live/2022/nov/17/cop27-draft-cover-text-published-fears-lack-ambition-live","fields":{"headline":"Cop27 president bemoans slow negotiations saying some countries failing to address urgency of climate crisis – as it happened","bodyText":"I’m signing off the blog now, after a day marked by stalling negotiations. It looks very much like the conference may overrun, as the draft text was perhaps the most bloated and confused we have ever seen at a Cop and even Shoukry admitted that things were not in a great place. The president of Cop27, Egypt’s foreign minister Sameh Shoukry, said he was very worried about the slow progress of the negotiations and issued a stern message to country delegates. “While some of the discussions [have been] constructive and positive, others did not reflect the need to move collectively to address the gravity and urgency of the climate crisis,” he declared. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, was of a similar opinion. Fresh from the G20 summit in Bali, he warned that time was running out, both for the talks in Sharm el-Sheikh and for the planet. “The climate clock is ticking, and trust keeps eroding,” he said. His verdict on Thursday evening was grim: “There is clearly a breakdown in trust north and south, and between developed and emerging economies.” But he urged countries to keep trying for common ground. “This is no time for finger-pointing. The blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction.” Brazil’s incoming president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, met Indigenous leaders and said what many have been thinking at Cop – that those most impacted by the climate emergency are not represented at these negotiations. He said that he was unable to represent all views in the room of Indigenous leaders. He talked about G20 meetings and his feeling that nothing was said about the issues of civil society during them. “Poor people don’t exist on the agenda, do not exist on their agenda … Indigenous communities, black communities … trade unions,” he said. Ellie Goulding wrote a dispatch for us – not every day you get a pop star on the Cop27 blog! She demanded that fossil fuel lobbyists be banned from Cops, accusing them of “hijacking” proceedings. Developing countries demanded that an agreement is reached in Egypt to set up a funding mechanism to pay them for loss and damage. Sherry Rehman, Pakistan’s climate change minister, representing the G77, said negotiations were at a “pivotal moment”. Rehman said common ground must be found and a political decision taken this week. “We are saying give us a political message that we are all willing to take this forward as a community of nations,” she said. But she said a walkout by countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts was premature. “We’re now in the weeds of negotiations. I don’t walk out of negotiations. I try to work around them.” The big news was that the Cop cover text draft was published, though it is likely to change significantly in the coming days. Many were disappointed with the bulky and confusing document, which was labelled by some as “more of a shopping list than a draft text”. The UK’s Alok Sharma, the EU’s Frans Timmermans and Canada’s Steven Guilbeault went to see the Cop27 president, Sameh Shoukry, saying there were too many gaps in it. Thank you so much for following along. We will be covering Cop right to the bitter end – whenever that will be! Stay tuned and keep checking the Guardian for the latest climate stories and the ins and outs of negotiations. Have a lovely evening. The British-Egyptian hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah is in a bad way, according to his family, who have just released a statement on Twitter. They say he is “exhausted, weak, vulnerable and very very thin”. They claim he has faced intimidating treatment in prison. Read more below. I just bumped into Germany’s special climate envoy, Jennifer Morgan, who is trying to broker a compromise on the key issue of loss and damage. “We are in the thick of it,” she said, hurrying away with her team. She would not give an update on anything else. The president of Cop27, Egypt’s foreign minister Sameh Shoukry, is now very worried about the slow progress of the negotiations and has issued a stern message to country delegates. They may well think privately that the presidency shares the blame. Shoukry said: “World leaders descended on this venue [last week] and expressed unequivocal support to the global efforts to tackle climate change – this political will needs to find its way fully to the negotiating rooms.” “While some of the discussions [have been] constructive and positive, others did not reflect the need to move collectively to address the gravity and urgency of the climate crisis. The mitigation work programme [to speed up emissions cuts] is yet to reach the desired outcome. Adaptation is still held back by procedural matters. Ambitious outcomes on finance have not yet materialised. And on loss and damage, parties are shying away from taking the difficult political decisions.” “I reiterate what was highlighted by President al-Sisi at the opening ceremony: the world has become a stage for a continuously running show of human misery and pain. This needs to end now, not tomorrow.” “I urge all [countries] to go the extra mile, take the necessary steps to reach the much-needed conclusions and agreements. The world is waiting for us to demonstrate the seriousness by which we tackle this matter, and as a community of nations we must live up to their expectations.” Earlier today, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, told delegates at Cop27: “This is no time for finger-pointing. The blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction.” As we wait for more results from negotiations, here’s some depressing reading from the Met Office. We’ve heard many leaders at Cop27 talking about keeping 1.5C alive, and that was the theme of Glasgow, too. But top meteorologists in England say that this climate goal is very unlikely to happen until 2100 – that is, we will exceed 1.5C, then the world may cool in years to come. This would obviously have devastating consequences for millions. The study published in the journal Weather shows pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions agreed last year at the Glasgow climate conference (Cop26) are not likely to be sufficient to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C or below compared with pre-industrial levels. Dr Andy Wiltshire is the Met Office’s head of Earth system and mitigation science and lead author of the analysis. He said: “Implementing all the pledges from Glasgow would bring annual global emissions of carbon dioxide or their equivalents down to between 45 and 49 gigatonnes by 2030. But at this level there are no future pathways likely to avoid going above 1.5C. To give the 1.5C threshold at least a 50% chance of being met without continued exceedance, we need to see annual emissions down to around 30 gigatonnes by 2030.” An update on Alaa Abd el-Fattah from AFP. His health is deteriorating, according to family members. The jailed British-Egyptian activist’s health had “deteriorated severely”, his sister said on Thursday after the first family visit since he ended a seven-month-long hunger strike. In a message on Twitter, Mona Seif said news from the visit was “unsettling”. “Alaa deteriorated severely in the past two weeks, but at least they got to see him, and he needed to see the family so much,” she wrote. His other sister, Sanaa Seif, said her brother appeared “frail, vulnerable and emotional” during the visit, which was conducted “behind a glass shield with a phone speaker with little space to understand or communicate”. After seven months consuming what his family said was “100 calories a day”, Abd el-Fattah escalated his strike to all food, and then water on 6 November to coincide with the start of the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt. In a letter handed to his family on Tuesday, but dated Monday, he said he had ended the strike. Thursday was the first time the activist’s mother, Laila Soueif, was allowed to visit him in nearly a month, after prison authorities repeatedly denied her access last week. The family has not disclosed more information about the visit or Abd el-Fattah’s status, but “will share the full details later,” Seif added. The pro-democracy blogger is serving a five-year sentence for “spreading false news” by sharing another user’s Facebook post about police brutality. Here is why we are expecting Cop to drag on a bit. Simon Evans from Carbon Brief is excellent at making colour-coded charts for our fatigued eyes to look at, and he’s made one today of how negotiations are going. As you can see, not much has been agreed yet. So many people are wondering how long until the agreement is signed off and everyone can go home. One negotiator from a leading country at Cop27 seems pessimistic about the time frame – not least because they contracted food poisoning from the shoddy offering at Cop. “I’ve never seen us so united on an issue as loss and damage,” said the negotiator, who is from a G77 country. “There is strong pushback from the US in particular. They have said they won’t accept a decision that establishes a fund on loss and damage. That’s where the impasse is. The G77 is saying that’s unacceptable. We are saying we need a decision now and a process to negotiate the terms of reference. We want a decision on establishing the fund right now and there’s a negative reaction from developed countries.” On Egypt’s organisation, they said: “I’m really worried. It’s likely they will drag on until Saturday. I really don’t know if we will get a proper final text. It will really depend how far countries are willing to take things. Some might say unless there’s no agreement on loss and damage, there’s no outcome. “When there’s no agreement, the presidency usually gets blamed for that, so I’m sure the Egyptians will want to avoid that. Just like Copenhagen and the Danish at Cop15. There are a lot of issues that are still open. “The cover decision, that is a total mess. They’re still discussing it and the meeting started nearly six hours ago. The document doesn’t even contain proper text. It’s just a list of topics. It was supposed to be a two-hour meeting. “On the basis of this round of talks today, I hope the presidency will prepare an actual draft decision. It will take us a long time to agree on a text, so it’s a cause for concern. “We won’t leave before midnight, I think. We are all pretty tired. I have had food poisoning. There’s no decent food here. I never drink Coca-Cola, but I’ve been drinking loads here,” the negotiator said. Our tireless correspondent Fiona Harvey, who has been reporting non-stop from Egypt for weeks, has encountered some people with even more vim and vigour than her. To be fair, she’s had to spend hours today going through that dreaded and giant draft text so the rest of us can try to understand it. I am now using the live blog to shamelessly promote my own work. Captive audience and all that. So, earlier this autumn, I broke the story that Liz Truss, our former prime minister wanted to ban solar power from most of England’s farmland. It was thought – and hoped – that like most of her ill-advised schemes, this would also be dropped. However, fresh from burnishing her green credentials at Cop27, the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey signalled this morning that the ban was still on the table. I spent a long time trying to get an answer out of Defra about it, and they refused to deny this was the case and said they were looking at how to balance food production and energy security, and pointed to her comments that brownfield land is preferable. Other countries, who are investing heavily in renewables, must be very confused by our government’s position. Read more below. Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, has just flown in from Bali, after the G20 meeting, clearly frustrated by the lack of progress at Cop27. He warned that time was running out, both for the talks in Sharm El-Sheikh and for the planet. “The climate clock is ticking, and trust keeps eroding,” he said. On the eve of Cop27, Guterres told the Guardian in an exclusive interview that he wanted to see “a historic pact” forged at Cop27, between the developed and the developing world, over issues such as loss and damage and the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions faster. Failure to produce such a pact would mean “we are doomed”, he told the Guardian starkly. His verdict on Thursday evening was grim: “There is clearly a breakdown in trust north and south, and between developed and emerging economies.” But he urged countries to keep trying for common ground. “This is no time for fingerpointing. The blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction.” He identified three areas where compromise was needed: on loss and damage; on addressing the “huge” gap between countries pledges on greenhouse gas emissions and the cuts needed to stay within 1.5C of pre-industrial temperatures; and for developed countries to provide the $100bn in climate finance that developing countries had been promised they would receive from 2020, and for the proportion of the $100bn going to adaptation projects to be doubled. “The time for talking on loss and damage is over,” he declared. “We need action… We cannot continue to deny climate justice to those who have contributed least to the climate crisis, and are getting hurt the most.” There is currently no agreement between developed and developing countries on what form any financial settlement on loss and damage should take. On the 1.5C goal, he warned: “The 1.5C target is not simply about keeping a goal alive – it’s about keeping people alive… I see the will to keep to the 1.5C goal, but we must ensure that commitment is evident in the Cop27 outcome.” He called for an expansion in just transition partnerships, of the kind announced last year in Glasgow for South Africa, and this week for Indonesia, to help workers move from jobs in coal to jobs in renewable energy. He also called for reform of the World Bank and its fellow multilateral development banks, and for the expansion of renewable energy, which he called “the exit ramp from the highway to climate hell”. He said: “We know what we need to do, and we have the tools and resources to get it done.” People inside the negotiations told the Guardian that the Egyptian hosts had described the text sent out this morning as a “compilation” rather than a draft text. Consultations then took place but they were mainly a repeat of previous discussions, the Guardian understands. It is also unclear how discussions on loss and damage will be resolved and included in any draft text. In the current “compilation” they are mostly blank, with “placeholder” text showing that almost nothing on the subject has yet been agreed. Back in the UK, our environment editor Damian Carrington has been analysing the green measures in chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement. Spoiler alert: they are not impressive. How wonderful for the country’s green reputation during Cop. Read more below. Lula is about to speak. He is being given necklaces and gives by community representatives.

He talks about G20 meetings and his feeling that nothing was said about the issues of civil society in these meetings. “Poor people don’t exist on the agenda do not exist on their agenda… indigenous communities, black communities… trade unions,” he says. This is a struggle of at least 40 years, says Lula. “I have the will to represent indigenous communities. My country is huge… when Brazil was discovered, historians says it has 5 million. Today, it has only 870 thousand because of the struggles that they went through,” he says. We need to change our understanding of the world, Lula says. The bottom line is that indigenous people are not treated as if they were human beings, just figures, he says. This is the point of view we must change. We have the moral obligation to make reparations to indigenous communities, says Lula. He says people won’t be treated as second class citizens under his presidency. That’s why he is creating a cabinet position for First Nations people. Humanity is learning that taking care of ecosystems and biodiversity is not optional. “We don’t have two planet Earths,” he says. Lula says he is concerned about people making rockets to go to space. He says that money should be invested in conservation and improving people’s lives. He says indigenous people should be seen as a solution, not a problem. As Cop27 draws to an official close – though who knows how long it’ll overrun – experts have been giving their reviews of the summit. Alycia Leonard, postdoctoral research assistant, energy and power group at the University of Oxford, was on the ground at the conference. For her, it’s been a mixed b ag. There is a sense on the ground that this COP could be the beginning of the end of 1.5 degrees....But this COP has also normalised the once radical notion of North-to-South loss and damage reparations. People are beginning to realise the dire warnings put forward by small island states for years will soon come home. The most inspiring voices to me this COP were those of indigenous women, which rang loud and true with the wisdom we need to confront this crisis….It doesn’t have to be a zero sum game. We can and must all win together. Robert Pritchard, Senior Analyst at GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company, was underwhelmed: Greta Thunberg decided to promote her book, ‘The Climate Book’—available in both online and ‘dead tree’ versions—rather than attend the COP27 event in Sharm el-Sheik, and, unfortunately, that might have been the right decision. Last year’s Cop26 agreement pact to work towards a 1.5C rise in global temperature appears to be failing, as governments struggle to cope with more immediate concerns, despite Wednesday’s G20 pledge. The trouble is that governments tend to think in four- or five-year increments, rather than the longer term. It is day three of Lula’s visit to Cop27 and I am waiting for the Brazilian president-elect to speak with Indigenous leaders at a side event near the main plenary hall. The room is bursting with colour from the traditional dress. Lula has said he will put Indigenous rights at the heart of his presidency, given that it is a scientific fact that they are the best guardians of nature in their territories around the world. It is peaceful inside the room, contrasting with the carnival atmosphere that has followed Lula around wherever he has been in Egypt. Big crowds sung his name yesterday as he told the summit that “Brazil is back”. The event begins with testimonies from Indigenous leaders from around the world and a very warm welcome for the president-elect. Lula is thanked for his record on speaking up for Indigenous communities and the hosts explain the key role they have played at protecting climate critical ecosystems, from the Arctic to the Pacific Ocean. Representatives from seven regions will address Lula for a minute each shortly. First up is the representative from Africa. He congratulates Lula on his election and says he home he will provide global leadership on vulnerable Indigenous communities. He pays tribute to his background as a trade unionist. He asks for support with biodiversity protection, saying indigenous rights protectors are being an “endangered species”. The African Indigenous representative says communities need more funding and resources, especially given their impact counteracting global heating. “We didn’t cause climate change but we suffer the impacts,” he concludes. Next is Asia. The representative says she is from Borneo and congratulates him on his election, praising him for his commitment to stop deforestation. She asks Lula to speak to world leaders in Asia about protecting tropical forests. “Together with our brothers and sisters, we count on you to advance real solutions to climate change,” she says. The representative for the Pacific is up. She is from the Mariana islands from the same stretch as Guam. She says the area makes up one third of the Earth’s surface and her people have an intimate relationship with the ocean. She asks Lula to support the demilitarisation of the Pacific and end fossil fuel exploration. Now it’s Russia and eastern Europe. The Indigenous representative praises his respect for traditional knowledge and communities in the Amazon. He highlights to role of the Siberian forest, the Taiga, where he says there are big challenges. He says they need Lula’s solidarity for the consequences of climate change there. “We believe we are the race and reputation of our forest, standing and speaking up for our trees, our rivers and lakes,” he concludes. Three regions to go. The Arctic representative is speaking now. The growing impacts of climate change are evident in his ancestral lands, he says, and with it the connection with the land. “It is imperative that action is taken,” he says. “Preservation of the Arctic is related to the protection of the Brazilian rainforests.” He concludes but congratulating him on his election victory again. North America’s turn now. The chief acknowledges the Egyptian people for holding the Cop here and greets Lula and his wife. He says climate change affects all Indigenous regions. He says Indigenous peoples have been left out of Cop27 discussions despite being from the “ground zero” of climate change. “And yet, we have not received the resources we need,” he says. He says his brothers and sisters are dealing with storms and hurricanes as a consequence of global heating. “Perhaps you as a leader, you can demonstrate to other leaders to take a leadership role on climate change,” he says. He says he hopes he will be at Cop15 in Montreal for the biodiversity cop. Finally, the representative from Latin America speaks. Brother Lula, he starts. “The world has been waiting for Lula and Lula is here,” he says to applause. Now the world wants to follow your path, he says. “Viva Lula and out Bolsonaro,” he concludes. Avid blog readers may remember that I promised you a dispatch from an A-Lister the other day, then didn’t deliver it. Well, that is because pop stars aren’t as good, it turns out, as journalists at meeting deadlines. Anyway, I am thrilled that Ellie Goulding, international superstar and environment campaigner, has agreed to write a little Cop diary for the Guardian liveblog. Here it is below – thank you Ellie! On arrival Immediately I could sense a different energy to the Glasgow Cop – which was my first experience last year. (By the way I’ve discovered that climate people always compare Cops – it’s a “thing”. That makes sense because they’re so huge and confusing, it’s a way of trying to work out whether you’re at a good Cop or a bad Cop). Glasgow was very focused, but really dry. Egypt has a real vibe. I think this is driven by the amount of young people from all over the world who were running up to me, singing my songs, taking selfies (there was a lot of this!) and urging me to get to the Children and Youth Pavilion, as a matter of urgency. Meeting Ed Miliband Shuttling between events (which means running and then stopping to say “Hi” to anyone you recognise like Ed Miliband who said things were going slowly in the official negotiations. I heard this a lot) means you get a lot of time in the walkways. I saw an indigenous community holding what looked like a ritual prayer for Mother Earth on one walkway. On one hand it gives the Cop so much energy and presence, but then on the other you’re worried that certain groups don’t have enough official space and are reduced to the corridor. WWF Brasil and Angela Mendes After a few media interviews, including one where the VP of Mexico was interacting with a guy in a dinosaur costume in the background (there is an element of circus here too, which I quite like), I head to the Panda Pavilion and WWF Brazil. I meet Angela Mendes, the daughter of the great indigenous community leader, Chico Mendes, who was murdered by a rancher in the 1990s. The presence of Chico looms burns brightly for all activists fighting for the Amazon. Angela is wonderful and in a small, slightly sterile room – the meeting rooms aren’t lovely at Cop – she manages to bring the forest alive in her descriptions. She wants my help with handing in a “complaint” to the UN alongside a WWF report on the state of the Brazilian Amazon. During the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, deforestation has escalated to such an extent that the Amazon has been pushed to the brink. The “complaint” is a technical manoeuvre that allows the UN to formalise a request to Brazil that they prioritise ending deforestation again. The Youth Pavilion Afterwards I made good on my promise to attend the Children and Youth Pavilion, the first to be held in the Blue Zone at Cop. Rather than being flooded with oil executives, it was flooded with young global leaders and would be leaders from all different backgrounds. It was such a beautiful experience. Everyone was talking really fast, telling me what they do and asking me about my work. It was difficult to leave, not only because by this point I was surrounded by a large crowd of amazing young people – a sort of slow-moving 100 person selfie. Meeting environment ministers from across the world There’s a lot of criticism of Cops as a talking shop or some sort of nice holiday. But I promise you officials and other delegates are in back-to-back meetings, there’s little sleep and negotiations start to show on faces certainly by day 10. I attend a dinner with environment ministers and their teams from all over the world, convened by the UK’s Zac Goldsmith. You could tell they were tired but ploughing on. What amazes me about this group is that they never stop trying to get a better deal for nature. Alok Sharma was there with his team, and it reminded me that the fact that we now have a biodiversity day is one of the legacies of the Glasgow Cop, when the UK pushed to integrate nature into the climate talks. You can’t have climate stability without addressing the destruction of nature. Nature is our most important ally. Biodiversity Day For someone like me, I’m here to spotlight pieces of legislation, moments of action and sometimes give that final push. My big “moment” at Cop27’s designated Biodiversity Day is to represent the UN Environment Programme at a Hope for Corals event. This is the culmination of years of work for some people so it’s always an absolute honour but quite a lot of pressure. Inger Andersen, who is head of UNEP, is a hero of mine and very reassuring. She gave a wonderful opening speech where she told everyone what was at stake. What I love about her is that she isn’t afraid to use emotion to highlight the science. This is what I try to do too. You walk past so many “dry” talks and events at Cop. I’m sure they are important but they don’t send out stories to the wider world. I think that’s our job.As I speak I catch sight of the faces of some of the young climate and nature leaders I met at the youth pavilion the day before. I’m so happy they’ve come to support us on this issue. Ellie says: ban fossil fuel lobbyists For me, it’s this sort of support in Cop that makes a huge difference. But that won’t be possible if Cops continue to allow in hundreds of lobbyist from fossil fuel industries. It will kill the heart of Cop and it really shakes the foundation. I mention that in my speech and the fact the Global Witness counted 600plus applications from the oil and gas industries, more than any African delegation and this is the African Cop. Why do we continue to allow this process to be hijacked? Coming home How do I feel afterwards? I came back feeling like I had achieved something, but there’s always this uncertainty as to whether you’ve done anything at all. I always battle with this insecurity that I haven’t done enough. It’s intensified because there aren’t that many people from my world doing this stuff. But I do come away with a bit of hope and now I have to have trust that our global leaders have the courage to act at the scale needed. Bad news for fatigued journalists, diplomats and negotiators in Sharm el-Sheikh – it doesn’t seem these talks will wind up anytime soon. The Times’ environment editor Adam Vaughan (who was once of this parish) has been sitting in on a talk with Frans Timmermans, the executive vice-president for the European Green Deal. He’s pointed me towards his tweet, where he reported Timmermans said there was a “long and difficult journey” to the end of the conference and he was not sure when the talks would end. Those who have ploughed through the draft text, which is not really in great shape, may not be surprised by these pronouncements. “Coral reefs are not just a pretty face,” says Simon Donner, a climate scientist taking a break from the Cop27 summit to go snorkelling with us in Egypt – and to examine their current state. More than half a billion people around the world rely or benefit from coral reefs – and even if the 1.5C limit is kept, more than 90% of reefs will be destroyed by severe aquatic heatwaves. Reefs provide “really incredibly important services to people all across the tropics and subtropics, including food, income, but also shoreline protection”, Donner said, adding that without the structure of the coral reef off the coast of many islands, waves and the effects of rising sea levels would be much greater. But here in Sharm el-Sheikh, we spotted signs of disease and possible heat-related damage to corals that closely hug the shoreline. Read my colleague Oliver Milman’s full piece. Hello! Helena Horton here taking over from Sandra, and I will be guiding you through Cop27 this afternoon. First up, Carbon Brief are once again giving essential analysis. Here’s tits Leo Hickman showing how woolly the language used in the draft document is: Fiona Harvey has been through the monster draft document. Here is her annotation of the key points. Before I hand over to Helena Horton, here is a summary of the events so far today: The first draft of what could be the overarching agreement from the Cop27 climate summit has been published. It fails to include a call to phase down all fossil fuels, as required by the EU and India. There are no details on the setting up of a loss and damage fund. Anger and disappointment grows over the many gaps in the document. UK’s Alok Sharma joins EU and Canadian leaders in a face to face with the Egyptian presidency demanding a tougher recommitment to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C as tough negotiations begin over the draft. Developing countries are demanding an agreement is reached in Egypt to set up a funding mechanism to pay them for loss and damage. Sherry Rehman, Pakistan’s climate change minister and representing the G77, said negotiations were at a “pivotal moment”. Rehman said common ground must be found and a political decision taken this week. “We are saying give us a political message that we are all willing to take this forward as a community of nations,” she said. But she said a walkout by countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts was premature. “We’re now in the weeds of negotiations. I don’t walk out of negotiations. I try to work around them.” Referring to the floods that submerged a third of Pakistan’s habitable land this year, affecting 33 million people, Rehman said: “What went on in Pakistan will not stay in Pakistan. That dystopia that came to our doorstep will come to everyone. “We are very clear that we see this as a climate justice issue and if it continues to be kicked down the road we will see it as a justice denied issue ... Vulnerability should not become a death sentence, and that’s what a lot of people are facing.” Molwyn Joseph, the minister of environment for Antigua and Barbuda and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said political will to move forward on loss and damage “must be demonstrated by tangible evidence”. He wants a decision to establish a funding mechanism as a first step in Sharm el-Sheikh, with decisions on how it would be funded to come later. “I do not understand the reluctance, frankly. We have the opportunity at this Cop to plant the first seed of restoration for countries that are devastated, and that is to establish the fund. And then we can identify the financial flows into the fund.” Asked if any particular countries were frustrating the process, he declined to name names. “I think there is a kind of inertia that has existed for too long.” The UK’s Alok Sharma, the EU’s Frans Timmermans and Canada’s Steven Guilbeault have been to see Cop27 president, Sameh Shoukry, saying there are too many gaps in the climate draft. They are urging a stronger recommitment to limiting the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The family of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, the British-Egyptian political prisoner whose case has put the international spotlight on Egypt’s human rights record throughout Cop27, are waiting to visit him in Wadi al Natrun prison. His aunt Ahdaf Soueif tweeted a picture of the activist’s mother, Laila Soueif, reading as they passed through the layers of security needed to enter for family visits, with the caption “waiting”. Alongside them is Sanaa Seif, who attended Cop27 as an observer to draw attention to her brother’s case. Abd el-Fattah told his family in a letter earlier this week that he would end the hunger strike he began in April, intended to protest against his detention conditions and to demand a visit from British consular officials. He had subsisted for more than six months on 100 calories a day, his health visibly deteriorating. Shortly before Cop he said he would be escalating his hunger strike to include ceasing to drink water on the day the climate summit began. But the Egyptian authorities said Abd el-Fattah was subject to a “medical intervention” last week without specifying further. His family hope to learn more on the visit today about his condition. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 this morning before she left for Wadi al Natrun prison, his mother said: “I hope I will find him reasonably well and reasonably optimistic. I don’t know how he was persuaded to break his hunger strike, I still have to find that out, see what he’s been told, what he’s been promised, where it’s logical or whether it feels like I trap I have no idea. I have to wait and see.” The world deserves better, says Fredrick Njehu, senior Africa policy adviser at Tearfund. “This was billed as an implementation COP - an opportunity to take real action, especially on the key issues of climate finance and phasing out fossil fuels. “But today’s draft text signals betrayal of the most vulnerable countries who are counting the cost of inaction and facing ever bigger bills for loss and damage. “If this text is agreed in its current form it will fail to bring justice for those suffering the worst effects of the climate crisis.” Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate challenged world leaders in Egypt on their three decades of broken promises. Adam Morton, the Guardian’s correspondent in Sharm el-Sheikh, analyses how the draft fails to include the call from India, EU and the US, for the phasing down of all fossil fuels - and not just coal – and provides a sliver of hope it might later be included. “It appears to have hit a snag, given its absence from the draft text released this morning,” he says. “But it remains a live campaign that has grown rapidly this week. The change was proposed by India and has received some heavyweight support, including from the UK, EU, Tuvalu and US climate envoy John Kerry. “If accepted, it would be the first official acknowledgement in COP text of what should be an obvious point - that gas and oil need to be phased down. Given the damage caused by these industries - and the persistent greenwashing claims about gas being a “clean energy source” - activists believe it is a vital step. “There is some scepticism about India’s motivation. It was famously slow to support the inclusion of phasing down coal in the Glasgow pact, and led a charge that watered down the language from phasing out coal. “Some observers believe India is pushing the broader definition in part because it is less likely to win consensus support. India uses little gas, so has little to lose from the change.” Despite it being absent from the draft, Morton says it is now on the table, which means pressure will grow for its inclusion in this and future agreements. The international NGO ActionAid is calling on the Egyptian presidency to withdraw and rewrite the draft. Teresa Anderson, global lead on climate justice, said: “After encouraging language proposed by India and supported by the EU and even US, the language in the draft around phaseout of fossil fuels is far too weak, referring only to ‘unabated coal’. “What we need is an equitable phase out of all fossil fuels if we’re going to ensure the world’s temperature does not rise above 1.5C but this plan won’t achieve that. “The language on finance is similarly weak …the global climate crisis cannot be resolved unless rich countries take action the fastest, including by providing finance for developing countries. “We urgently call on the presidency to recover this note.” Satyendra Prasad, the Fiji ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations, represents a country that is one of the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. “Fossil fuels must be phased out, period,” said Prasad. “Who is saying it must be phased down? Anyone who is saying they must be phased down … Tell us, show us the pace at which you are exponentially increasing your ‘phasing down’? Show us the numbers and let it be convincing. There is no question, there is no stable planet for all of us including those who are arguing for a slower phasing down, that fossil fuels are not part of a 1.5C feature for the planet. That era is gone, that time has passed and all we need is commitment and energy and pace, and the global solidarity that allows us to phase out, period.” The summit is now likely to be extended beyond its scheduled end on Friday, say observers, with all-night sessions likely in an attempt to form an agreement and fill gaps in the document. Bob Ward, the policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said the document was some way from being a final agreement between all countries. “It shows little evidence of progress,” he said. “I think it is now certain that this summit will carry on past it scheduled end point into the weekend. “There is a lot of work for the negotiators to do, including all-night sessions that will test everybody’s endurance. I hope politicians and policy-makers around the world will be pushing their negotiating teams to seek an ambitious and collaborative outcome from Cop27. We can see the growing impacts of climate change all around us harming lives and livelihoods. We are running out of time and the world cannot afford for this summit to fail.” So far there is not much optimism emerging around the lack of ambition of the Egyptian presidencies draft Cop27 cover note. Away from the hotels of Sharm el-Sheikh, there are reminders across the world of what is at stake in the negotiations on the draft. The heavy rain behind recent devastating flooding in Nigeria, Niger and Chad was made about 80 times more likely by the climate crisis, a study by the World Weather Attribution group has found. The finding is the latest stark example of the severe impacts that global heating is already wreaking on communities, even with just a 1C rise in global temperature to date. It adds pressure on countries at Cop27 to deliver meaningful action on protecting and compensating those affected. “The analysis found a very clear fingerprint of anthropogenic climate change,” said Prof Maarten van Aalst, the director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. “As scientists, we are not in a position to tell Cop27 negotiators whether it needs to be a loss and damage fund, or a facility, or a mosaic of solutions, as are all being discussed,” he said. “But what is very clear from the science is that this is a real and present problem and that it’s particularly the poorest countries that are getting hit very hard, so it’s clear that solutions are needed.” Read more here: The location for the next Cop … Johan Rockström, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, like the boy in the Emperor’s New Clothes, brings clarity. A reminder of how the world’s leaders arrived at the summit. Our correspondent Oliver Milman provides a glimmer of hope on details of 18 countries, including the UK, France and Australia, that have signed up to a US initiative unveiled at Cop27 to get public sector emissions to net zero by 2050. The scheme is targeted at emissions coming from government use of electricity, cars and other sources, which can be significant. For example, the US Department of Defense, is not only the largest consumer of energy in the US but is also the world’s largest institutional consumer of petroleum from the fuel used in its trucks, tanks, ships and other vehicles. John Kerry, the US’s climate envoy, said the agreement showed there was a “growing global consensus about the role of governments in the transition” to clean energy. As global politicians face difficult discussions on the draft over the coming hours, public opinion appears to be supportive of the idea that richer countries should pay loss and damage finances for climate action in poor countries. Damian Carrington, our environment editor writes: A significant majority of people in the UK think the country has a responsibility to pay for climate action in poorer and vulnerable countries, an opinion poll conducted for the Guardian shows. The issue of rich, polluting countries providing substantial funding to developing countries is central to success at Cop27 climate. The poll told those questioned that the UK’s total emissions over time are among the highest in the world, while poorer countries have produced very few emissions. The results showed 49% of people said the UK did have a responsibility to provide climate funding, with 31% saying the UK did not and 20% saying they did not know. A separate poll across all G7 countries found 65% of people agreed that richer countries should pay more of the costs of climate action because they were historically responsible for more damage, with 11% disagreeing. Read more here: These seem to be the key points of interest in the draft so far. It is 20 pages long however and more may emerge over the next couple of hours. No details of a fund on loss and damage financing for poorer countries “Welcomes” the fact that parties agreed for the first time to include “matters related to funding arrangements responding to loss and damage” on the summit agenda. No call for a phase down on all fossil fuels Stresses the importance of exerting all efforts to meet Paris Agreement goal of holding global average temperature to well below 2C and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C As Fiona Harvey says this draft repeats the goal from last year’s Glasgow Climate Pact to “to accelerate measures towards the phase down of unabated coal power and phase out and rationalize inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.” But it does not call for a phase down of all fossil fuels as requested by India and the EU. Some context as to where this draft document sits in the long history of COP discussions. Last year at Glasgow’s COP26 was the first time that a decision agreed upon by all parties even mentioned fossil fuels and coal as part of the climate. Climate Home points out on the draft: Greenpeace International’s Cop27 head of delegation, Yeb Saño, pulls no punches, saying: “The Cop27 presidency pushes the pedal to the metal on the highway to climate hell.”  Saño went on: “We came to Sharm el-Sheikh to demand real action on meeting and exceeding climate finance and adaptation commitments, a phase out of all fossil fuels and for rich countries to pay for the loss and damage done to the most vulnerable communities within developing countries by agreeing a loss and damage finance fund. “None of that is on offer in this draft. Climate justice will not be served if this sets the bar for a Cop27 outcome. “After initially failing to even mention fossil fuels, the draft text is an abdication of responsibility to capture the urgency expressed by many countries to see all oil and gas added to coal for at least a phase down. It is time to end the denial, the fossil fuel age must be brought to a rapid end.”  In the midst of the explosion of analysis around the 20-page draft, Patrick Greenfield, our correspondent in Sharm el-Sheikh, updates on what to expect from today. “We are at the business end of the climate summit and all eyes are on the political outcome, known as the “cover decision”. This morning, a draft was finally published. My colleague Fiona Harvey is going through the 20-page text to understand its significance. In theory, Cop27 is scheduled to finish tomorrow evening but nobody thinks that will happen. The summit is likely to drag on over the weekend as countries wrangle over what should and should not be included in the final wording. We will bring you updates throughout the day from Egypt as negotiations enter the final stages.” Simon Evans, senior policy editor at Carbon Brief also points out the failure to mention all fossil fuels. The failure to include a call for a phase down in fossil fuels or mention oil and gas is a gaping hole in the draft, critics say. Reaction to the draft is coming in. Good morning, and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Cop27 climate conference. The big news this morning is that the first draft of the cover text has just been published, although it will change significantly in the coming days. Here’s a quick take from Reuters: The UN climate agency has published a first draft on Thursday of what could be the overarching agreement from the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt However, much of the text is likely to be reworked in the coming days. The document, labelled a “non-paper”, indicating it is still far from the final version, repeats the goal from last year’s Glasgow climate pact to “to accelerate measures towards the phase-down of unabated coal power and phase out and rationalise inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”. It does not call for a phase-down of all fossil fuels, as India and the EU had requested. The text does not include details for launching a fund for loss and damage, a key demand from the most climate vulnerable countries such as island nations. Rather, it “welcomes” the fact that parties have agreed for the first time to include “matters related to funding arrangements responding to loss and damage” on the summit agenda. It does not include a timeline for deciding on whether a separate fund should be created or what it should look like, giving time for negotiators to continue to working on the contentious topic. The initial reaction from many has been one of disappointment and worry at the pace of progress – with so much to be resolved, it is unlikely the conference will finish on time. We’ll have more detail on that, and analysis of the text, shortly.

Renewables were the UK’s second biggest source of electricity in the last three months of 2017, and now provide about a third of the country’s power at certain times of day. National Grid has warned that at times this summer there will be more electricity being generated than needed; when demand is low, solar output is high and some inflexible power stations are hard to turn off. With a significant number of large new offshore windfarms due to come online over the next few years, the challenge of balancing supply and demand will continue to grow. The Institution of Mechanical Engineers (iMechE) said the answer could be to use the power to generate hydrogen. Electricity would be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, with the hydrogen functioning as a form of energy storage for renewables. The gas would later be blended in with normal gas supplies for heating supplies, sent to fuel cells to generate electricity, or used for topping up hydrogen vehicles, iMechE said in a report backed by the gas industry. Dr Jenifer Baxter, the report’s lead author, said: “We are seeing continued expansion of renewables. If we’ve got a lot of low-carbon power, we want to make sure we’re using all of that.” The engineering group urged the government to bring the renewables, nuclear and gas industries together to work on “power to gas”, and encourage demonstration projects. The nuclear trade association welcomed the report. The iMechE also called for a government study into the environmental impact of lithium-batteries, which have been deployed on a large scale recently and offer an alternative way of storing energy. Last year the government gave much more backing to batteries, with the announcement of £246m for battery research and development, compared with £25m to explore using hydrogen for heating. Asked if the economics of hydrogen stacked up, Baxter said electricity was getting cheaper while electrolysers – used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen – were getting more efficient. Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said the report was good but cautioned it was pushing a very pro-gas agenda on how best to decarbonise heating, when there was still a lot of debate over the most cost-effective and feasible technologies. “This is part of a pattern of the gas industry trying to get that hydrogen route more in the debate. Policymakers need to look at the alternatives as well [such as electrification of transport and heat],” he said. Separately, a new report on Wednesday warned that there were “major technical challenges” to decarbonising heating by switching to greener gases such as hydrogen. The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said there are not yet any obvious ways that the technologies could achieve major reductions in cost."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/oct/17/for-australias-sake-i-hope-trumps-climate-science-denialism-loses","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-16T19:00:05Z","webTitle":"For Australia's sake, I hope Trump's climate science denialism loses | Michael Mann","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/17/for-australias-sake-i-hope-trumps-climate-science-denialism-loses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/17/for-australias-sake-i-hope-trumps-climate-science-denialism-loses","fields":{"headline":"For Australia's sake, I hope Trump's climate science denialism loses","bodyText":"Anyone in Australia who witnessed the Black Summer bushfires (as I did), and anyone in the US who experienced the thick smoke from our western wildfires (as I have), knows how much damage climate change is already doing. The stark reality is that worldwide efforts to avert ever-more catastrophic climate change impacts lie in the balance in the 2020 US election. Donald Trump will go down in history bearing substantial responsibility for the deaths of over 200,000 Americans due to his rejection of the advice of public health experts and his refusal to endorse policies such as social distancing and mask-wearing that could have saved many thousands of lives. But his rejection of the science of climate change sets the stage for a far greater toll. Far more human lives will be lost from the impacts of climate change if we fail to act. Whether or not Trump gets re-elected – and how other countries like Australia respond to the outcome of the US election – could determine the fate of our planet. Indeed, I’ve stated that a second Trump term might well be “game over for the climate” if it leads to the collapse of international efforts to act. The damage caused by Trump’s climate denial is painfully visible within the US as we endure climate change-fuelled extreme weather events, including unprecedented wildfires in the west and unprecedented hurricanes in the east. But the damage can be felt around the world. Trump has proudly, and shamelessly, trumpeted his climate denialism on the global stage, joining with petrostates such as Russia, Saudi Arabia and Brazil in opposing international climate efforts. Indeed, Trump’s actions have emboldened Australia to be less ambitious on climate too, prime minister Scott Morrison following Trump’s lead in promoting climate denial, coddling fossil fuel interests and blocking efforts to support a clean, renewable energy transition. By pulling the US out of the Paris agreement (one of the first and only campaign promises he kept) Trump ceded America’s leadership on the defining challenge of our time. Thus far, other countries have fortunately filled the leadership void, at least temporarily. The EU and China, with its new net-zero pledge, have stepped up to the plate, recognising that they will benefit from the opportunities of a clean energy economy and better protect their citizens from dangerous climate change impacts. But nobody stands to benefit more from climate action, or lose more if we fail to act, than Australia. Having spent a sabbatical leave down under earlier this year, aimed at collaborating with scientists in Australia to study the impact of climate change on extreme weather events, I instead witnessed those impacts first-hand. I saw the muted beauty of the Blue Mountains when shrouded in wildfire smoke. If Trump is re-elected, and we collectively continue down a path of insufficient climate action, it may not be long before those fires rage year-round, and the Blue Mountains are lost in a perpetual grey and dismal haze. It’s the same with the vibrant sea life of the Great Barrier Reef, which I was fortunate enough to witness with my family during my time in Australia. The delicate ecosystems of the GBR are already on the ropes, with fossil fuels pushing up temperatures in the ocean to the point where bleachings occur with such frequency and ferocity that corals simply cannot recover. Research released this week found that the reef has lost half its coral, largely due to warming oceans caused by climate change. Add the impact of ocean acidification from increasing carbon emissions, and we could sadly, within a decade or two, be reading the GBR’s obituary for real. It doesn’t have to be like that. For one thing, renewable energy costs are plummeting while the technology just keeps getting more efficient and better, so dirty energy no longer makes economic sense. For example, on one recent Sunday, all the electricity demand for the entire state of South Australia was met by solar power alone, and every state and territory in Australia has committed to go carbon neutral by 2050. Here in the US, we’ve seen a record number of cities and states stepping up on climate goals too, knowing clean energy is good for their communities’ health, resilience and prosperity. Policymakers must accelerate the shift to clean energy that is already under way. As we’ve learned in the Trump-era, some fossil fuels are too far gone for even the most determined polluter-in-chief to save. Though another term would give Trump time to defend his environmental rollbacks in court and solidify his dirty energy policies, he has already failed to save coal from market forces, and another four years isn’t going to reverse the long-term decline of the industry. This is a cautionary tale for Australia. In both the US and Australia, conservative politicians seem more eager to bail out dirty polluters than protect the public, denying politically inconvenient science in order to offer lavish payouts to help unprofitable fossil fuel companies. If we are to avert catastrophic warming, we must do just the opposite, providing financial incentives for renewables and disincentives for fossil fuels. That will level the playing field, and accelerate the clean energy transition. We must take the earliest exit possible off the fossil fuel highway. By trying to squeeze out the last drop of fossil fuel industry profits, the Morrison government could well be on its way to bleaching the life from Australia’s coral reefs and blighting the blue of its mountains. There is some good news, however. Regardless of whom Americans vote for – and for the sake of the planet, I hope it’s Joe Biden and the Democrats – Australians can still work together for structural change at home. You can’t solve it alone, but we also can’t solve it without you. Australia has seen that the sun can power an entire state’s electricity for a day. Now it’s time to make that happen every day. Australia must distance itself from the handful of bad petrostate actors who have sabotaged global climate action and rejoin the coalition of the willing, when it comes to the battle to save our planet. • Michael E.

Bernard Looney, who took the helm of the oil firm in February, said he was “more convinced than ever” that BP must embrace the energy transition following the collapse of global oil markets. He told the Guardian that his commitment to steering BP towards its net-zero carbon ambitions, set out earlier this year, is “deeper” due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. “I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do, and we need to crack on with it,” he said. “The pandemic only adds to the challenge that already exists for oil in the medium to long term.” Some energy economists believe demand for oil may never recover to its levels before the pandemic if changes to business travel and commuting remain after the lockdown ends. This raises serious questions over the business models of major oil companies, which are already under pressure due to tougher climate action and the rise of renewable energy. “We’re all living and working differently right now. Not all of that will stick, but some of it will stick for sure. The question I have is whether consumers will consume less, and I think there is a possibility that they will,” Looney said. The world’s oil demand has fallen to 25-year lows following the outbreak of Covid-19, which has severely limited demand for transport fuels, causing global oil prices to fall by two-thirds. The oil market crisis has wiped billions from major oil companies, including BP which reported a loss for the first quarter of this year. “I think this will remind people of the fragility of the ecosystem that we work in; people are looking up at the skies and seeing less pollution, and I do hope that there will be an even greater appreciation for nature as we move forward, which should keep the climate at the forefront of public debate,” he added. Looney began his tenure as BP boss by promising that the oil company would invest more in clean energy and less in fossil fuels over the next three decades as part of an ambition to become a carbon neutral business by 2050. The plan will use carbon offsets, such as tree-planting and emissions capture technology, to mitigate the fossil fuels it will continue to produce by the middle of the century. “Do the near-term issues cause us to be able to invest a little less than I would have liked in these next couple of years? Possibly,” he said. “But I do believe that we will remain true to what we said on 12 February; that over time, we will invest more into non-carbon businesses and less into hydrocarbon businesses.” The pressure facing oil producers has increased as investors begin to turn their backs on fossil fuels in favour of green energy, which is cheaper and offers more predictable returns. This year, US oil prices plunged below zero for the first time, while BP’s solar energy business, Lightsource, struck new US solar power contracts totaling 400MW, Looney said, which underlines the resilience of the business. “This is a sector which continues to attract investment and I think that’s because it is what society wants,” Looney said. “These are the reasons why my commitment [to net zero] remains as deep, if not deeper than it has been.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/may/12/global-carbon-emissions-to-slump-but-australias-electricity-grid-flatlines","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-11T17:30:48Z","webTitle":"Global carbon emissions to slump – but Australia's electricity grid flatlines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/12/global-carbon-emissions-to-slump-but-australias-electricity-grid-flatlines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/may/12/global-carbon-emissions-to-slump-but-australias-electricity-grid-flatlines","fields":{"headline":"Global carbon emissions to slump – but Australia's electricity grid flatlines","bodyText":"Global greenhouse gas emissions are expected to slump this year after countries and industries shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but Australia’s electricity grid appears immune. An analysis found the reduced economic activity over a five-week period was likely to have cut emissions from the country’s coal-dominated power generation by only about 1% compared with previous years. Total electricity consumption between 16 March and 21 April was 2.4% lower than last year, but more than half of that drop was likely attributable to it being warmer in 2019 in that period, leading to people running power-hungry air-conditioners more often. The report by Hugh Saddler, an energy analyst who writes a monthly national emissions audit for thinktank The Australia Institute, also underscores the pace at which renewable energy generation has increased. It provided more than 50% of power for nearly two hours in the middle of the day on Easter Saturday, the first time this happened for more than a few minutes. From December to March, distributed rooftop solar power provided 16.3% of electricity in South Australia and 7.7% in Queensland, up from 10.1% and 5.3% respectively two years ago. Within the grid, renewable energy was 24.9% of generation. Saddler, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said while Australia expected to see a significant fall in emissions from both road transport and aviation due to the virus shutdown when data became available, electricity and gas use had held up. “Given the disruptive nature of the pandemic and its effects on sectors like transport, it might surprise some that the fall in carbon emissions from electricity, the most polluting sector in Australia, has been so small,” he said. Saddler said Australia differed from some of the worst affected countries in that major energy users in Australia, such as mining, mineral processing and manufacturing operations, had mostly stayed open. Air-conditioning and lighting had continued to run in many shopping centres, offices, hotels and education centres though fewer people were using them, and household electricity use rose as people stayed home. While total national emissions had remained mostly flat under the Coalition prior to the pandemic, electricity emissions have been reducing as a wave of clean energy has come online, driven by the rapidly falling cost of wind and solar technology and the 2020 renewable energy target. Investment in large-scale clean generation slowed last year after the target was filled and not replaced, and delays in building transmission infrastructure. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said the pandemic risked slowing the power grid’s move towards a higher proportion of clean power if governments heeded a call from the Australian Energy Council, representing generators, retailers and networks, to use it to delay electricity market reforms. “Electricity emissions have been slightly dented but there has been no real change, and things could get worse if the federal government upgrades and extends coal clunkers as part of the pandemic recovery package,” he said. The report also examined the emissions contained in Australia’s east-coast liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry. It found the embodied emissions being shipped from Gladstone to Asia as LNG had a much larger carbon footprint than the emissions from gas-fired power plants in the national grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/mar/24/peregrine-falcon-drama-at-salisbury-cathedral-with-a-new-egg-and-a-lost-bird","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-24T13:12:17Z","webTitle":"Falcon drama at Salisbury Cathedral with a new egg and a lost bird","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/peregrine-falcon-drama-at-salisbury-cathedral-with-a-new-egg-and-a-lost-bird","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/mar/24/peregrine-falcon-drama-at-salisbury-cathedral-with-a-new-egg-and-a-lost-bird","fields":{"headline":"Falcon drama at Salisbury Cathedral with a new egg and a lost bird","bodyText":"The rollercoaster saga of the Salisbury Cathedral peregrine falcons is continuing this spring, with one bird protecting an egg on a balcony of the great building but another missing in action. A female that has been visiting the balcony regularly in recent weeks has laid one egg and can be viewed hunkering down on the nest via a cathedral webcam. Less cheerfully, a GPS tracking device that was attached to a bird, known as Sally, that used to nest at the cathedral has stopped giving out its signal. It could be that the device has stopped working or that, sadly, Sally is no more. Phil Sheldrake, species recovery officer with the RSPB, said: “It’s great that we have an egg – and quite a bit earlier than last year.” The female on the nest does not have an identity ring, meaning that it is not known if she is the same one that produced four eggs last year, but Sheldrake said it was highly likely that it was the same bird. “Peregrines do not like to be overlooked,” he said. “Salisbury Cathedral sticks out like a sore thumb above the rolling countryside. It’s like a five-star hotel for them.” There are generally three or four eggs in a clutch and incubation doesn’t start until the last egg is laid. Once that has happened, the female – and male - will sit on the nest at intervals to keep eggs warm. Incubation lasts 29-32 days, so if all goes well, chicks should appear in early May. Meanwhile, the tracker attached to Sally, who became a television star after featuring on BBC’s Springwatch in 2017, last pinpointed her on 3 November 2019 above the village of Coombe Bissett, three miles from Salisbury – but no signal has been picked up since. Sheldrake said: “We don’t know if she’s alive or whether the tracker has simply stopped working. We haven’t seen her on the cameras at the cathedral and it’s quite possible the tracking device has just stopped working after nearly three years. “She is possibly 10 now, and whilst the oldest peregrine known was at least 24, the average lifespan is around 10.” The tracker works on solar power, so if Sally has died it would probably not receive enough light to carry on working. Salisbury Cathedral has a historic bond with peregrines, which was broken in the 20th century because of persecution and pesticides. The first pair to breed in modern times arrived in 2014. The birds have done well there since then, apart from in 2018 when no eggs were laid following an unholy scrap between Sally and an unringed female."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2019/aug/22/rail-line-in-hampshire-is-worlds-first-to-be-powered-by-solar-farm","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-23T00:33:05Z","webTitle":"Rail line in Hampshire is world's first to be powered by solar farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/22/rail-line-in-hampshire-is-worlds-first-to-be-powered-by-solar-farm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2019/aug/22/rail-line-in-hampshire-is-worlds-first-to-be-powered-by-solar-farm","fields":{"headline":"Rail line in Hampshire is world's first to be powered by solar farm","bodyText":"The world’s first solar farm to power a railway line directly is due to plug into the track near Aldershot, paving the way for solar-powered trains. From Friday, about 100 solar panels at the trackside site will supply renewable electricity to power the signalling and lights on Network Rail’s Wessex route. The 30kW pilot scheme could pave the way for a larger project capable of directly powering the trains that use this route from next year. The solar breakthrough comes as Network Rail plans to spend billions of pounds electrifying rail lines to avoid running trains on diesel. This could help reduce air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and costs. Solar panels are already used to power the operations of train stations, including Blackfriars in central London. But the Aldershot project is the first time a solar array will bypass the electricity grid to plug directly into a railway’s “traction” system. Network Rail hopes to use the scheme, developed by the charity 10:10 Climate Action and Imperial College London, to solar-charge its rail lines across the country. Stuart Kistruck, a director for Network Rail’s Wessex route, said: “We have ambitions to roll this technology out further across the network should this demonstrator project prove successful, so we can deliver a greener, better railway for our passengers and the wider public.” The research team behind the project, called Riding Sunbeams, estimates that solar could power 20% of the Merseyrail network in Liverpool, as well as 15% of commuter routes in Kent, Sussex and Wessex. There is also scope for solar trams in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Nottingham, London and Manchester, according to the team. The researchers began work on the plans over two years ago to discover whether bypassing the electricity grid could make solar power a more efficient energy source for trains. Innovate UK awarded the project funding from the Department of Transport after it proved that connecting solar power directly to rail, tube and tram networks could help meet a significant share of their electricity needs. The falling cost of solar power technologies means these subsidy-free solar farms could supply electricity at a lower cost than the electricity supplied via the grid. The findings come as plans to electrify Britain’s rail lines have faltered in recent years owing to concern about costs. Leo Murray, the director of Riding Sunbeams, said future projects across the UK could be community-owned, and pay back benefits to local community funds. By the end of 2020, Riding Sunbeams hopes to build and connect the world’s first-ever full-scale community- and commuter-owned solar farm to UK railways. Murray said the railways will be able to cut their running costs and benefit local communities while playing a part in tackling the climate crisis. “Matchmaking the UK’s biggest electricity user, the railways, with the nation’s favourite energy source, solar power, looks like the start of the perfect relationship.” Murray added that the same model could be used across the world, particularly in sunny countries in South America, and India. India is already home to 250 trains powered by solar panels attached directly to the roof of the train, but it plans to develop its own trackside solar farms because the weight of the panels means their trains need more energy than usual. Indian Railways, the country’s single largest energy consumer, said last month it hoped to become the world’s first 100% “green” railway network in 10 years’ time by installing 30GW of solar generation capacity on some of its 51,000 hectares of vacant land. The plan is part of India’s drive to replace polluting coal-fired power with cleaner energy sources, including as much as 100GW of solar power. By 2025, Indian Railways expects to meet a third of its electricity demand from renewable energy sources by building 1.1GW from rooftop projects and 3.9GW worth of large-scale trackside solar farms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/nov/08/africa-poised-lead-way-global-green-revolution-says-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-08T00:01:10Z","webTitle":"Africa poised to lead way in global green revolution, says report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/08/africa-poised-lead-way-global-green-revolution-says-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/nov/08/africa-poised-lead-way-global-green-revolution-says-report","fields":{"headline":"Africa poised to lead way in global green revolution, says report","bodyText":"Africa is poised to lead the world’s cleanest economic revolution by using renewable energy sources to power a massive spread of urbanisation, says an IEA report. The IEA, or International Energy Agency, predicts that solar energy will play a big role in supporting the continent’s growing population and industrialisation over the next 20 years. Africa has less than half the solar power installations seen in the UK, despite the sunnier conditions, but the IEA is predicting a solar boom in countries across the continent, which could give hundreds of millions of homes electricity for the first time. The report forecasts that Africa’s appetite for energy will grow at double the rate of the global average in the coming decades as the continent overtakes China and India as the most populated region in the world. Africa’s population is expected to grow to more than 2 billion people by 2040, a rise of 800 million from today or the population equivalent of the US and Europe combined, says the report. People are expected to turn to cities and towns at a rate never seen before, where the demand for new houses and infrastructure will ignite an energy-hungry industrial revolution. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said Africa had a “unique opportunity” to leapfrog the fossil fuel dependency of other industrialised regions and host the first economic transformation that did not contribute to the climate crisis. “I am optimistic about Africa’s energy future – it will surprise pessimists,” Birol said. “I have great expectations for the energy industry in the years to come, both in terms of bringing energy access to Africa’s people but also driving economic growth.” He urged Africa’s leaders to take advantage of the natural resources available through solar power generation, and the mining of raw minerals needed to make electric and hydrogen batteries, which are in high demand across the world. He said some fossil fuels, such as natural gas, would be needed to support Africa’s heavy industries as they built the towns and cities needed to house the continent’s growing population. But the increase would be insignificant in the wider global climate effort, according to the IEA. Birol said: “Africa’s total contribution to cumulative global emissions from energy over the last 100 years is only 2%, which is half the emissions of Germany today. If everyone in Africa had access to energy this 2% will rise to just 3% – it’s still nothing. It’s peanuts compared to other countries in the world which are using fossil fuels such as coal for energy. “But while Africa does not contribute to climate change the continent is on the frontline of its potential effects, including droughts. Africa is perhaps the most innocent continent in terms of its contributions to climate change, but they will be the victims.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2019/apr/01/koshi-metro-smashed-old-rules-indian-women-drive-change-trains-kerala","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-01T06:00:28Z","webTitle":"‘The metro smashed the old rules’: Indian women drive change – and trains","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/01/koshi-metro-smashed-old-rules-indian-women-drive-change-trains-kerala","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2019/apr/01/koshi-metro-smashed-old-rules-indian-women-drive-change-trains-kerala","fields":{"headline":"‘The metro smashed the old rules’: Indian women drive change – and trains","bodyText":"Down on the platform, where the air is intensely muggy in the March heat, a train glides in. The driver is a woman. The ticket office is run by a woman. A transgender woman helps customers at the inquiry desk. On four of the metro’s stations, passengers can go into a special cubicle to breastfeed their babies. At the station, Rejitha, dressed in a turquoise and pink uniform, is on hand to help the hundreds of people who use the Kochi Metro every day. “See, you place it flat like this on the sensor to get through,” she tells a customer struggling to get through the ticket barrier. Clockwise from left: Kochi Metro train driver Hima C; a metro worker helps a passenger through the ticket barrier at Aluva station; the customer care centre at Aluva station; a customer care worker at Muttom station An army of women make up about 80% of the 1,300-strong metro workforce. From cleaning posts to senior management roles – aside from the managing director, who is a man – this is an operation conceived to give women more job opportunities. “It’s a safe and clean environment for me. The money I get makes a big difference to our budget and to what I can do for my family,” says Rejitha, who goes by a single name. Passengers walk past a breastfeeding pod at Aluva metro station in Kochi The predominance of women explains the decision to install the breastfeeding pods, equipped with a seat, fan, and phone charging point. The pods are located in parts of stations that can be accessed without a ticket so that any passing woman who needs it can walk in off the street and use it. “We realised that breastfeeding rates were coming down in Kerala and wondered if we could help. If demand goes up, we will install more of them,” says Sumi Nadarajan, senior deputy general manager for planning and sustainability. Plants are seen on the pillars of Palarivattom metro station This sensitivity typifies many of the state-owned metro’s policies. It was an unusual infrastructure project from the outset. In a country where projects routinely run over budget and break deadlines, the metro was completed within the agreed cost and time constraints. It uses solar power for 35% of its energy needs, and more than 200 of the pillars dotted around the station have been turned into vertical gardens with the use of compost made from municipal waste. One key decision was to train and appoint female drivers: seven out of the 39 drivers are women. Another was hiring 60 transgender women, the first time any company in India has formally decided to hire along such lines. As former metro managing director Elias George said at the time, “society’s mindset will change only by direct interaction with” transgender people. In a move to give further jobs to women, the metro joined up with a women’s collective called Kudumbashree to supply meals. Women cook lunches in their homes and, travelling on the metro, deliver the meals in steel “tiffin” boxes (to avoid plastic) to metro employees at various stations. They earn money and metro employees enjoy home-cooked food. Members of the Kudumbhashree women’s collective make and distribute lunches for Koshi Metro staff “From day one, we believed the policies that shape this institution must be progressive and innovative and aimed at social inclusion and women’s empowerment,” says Kochi Metro managing director Mohammed Hanish. Bringing Kerala’s transgender people into the public eye has not been easy. Unlike in other parts of India, transgender people here live hidden away. “In north India, transgenders live in communities called hamams but in Kerala they are solitary and isolated,” says Sumi Mohan, board member of human rights organisation Sahayatrika. The attrition rate among transgender employees has been high. Finding affordable accommodation near the station where they work was a problem for many. “It was a challenge keeping them employed. Many took lots of medical leave. They need surgery or they have issues with their hormone treatment. And they wanted a daily wage. They live from hand to mouth and can’t wait for a month before being paid. But we couldn’t change the rules for just one section of employees,” says Natarajan. Kothi Metro employee Karthika poses at Changampuzha Park station As a result, only a dozen remain. One of them is Karthika Raghavan, 36, who gave up her job as a biochemist in a laboratory, because it was too solitary, to work as a customer assistant on the metro. Raghavan’s parents accepted her and she continues to live with them, something of a rarity among transgender people in Kerala. “My job in the lab was with non-living things. Being out and meeting all kinds of people on the metro makes me feel happy,” she says in fluent English. “Whenever I used to look for jobs, the ad specified male or female. The Kochi Metro has smashed all the old rules by giving us work.” The metro’s policies stem from a wider progressive ethos that is perhaps unique to Kerala. Although the state has been in the news recently for the campaign by women to win the right to pray at the Sabarimala temple, where women have been denied entry for decades, this is something of an aberration. The state has a high female literacy rate, low maternal and infant mortality, and a healthy sex ratio compared with other Indian states. Nevertheless, few women, despite being educated, feature in the labour force. According to the latest official data for 2011-12, 22% of women work in the formal sector in rural areas, compared with 56% of men, lower than the 25% figure for India as a whole. This is why the Kochi Metro made a conscious effort to give jobs to women. There has been no shortage of takers. Women even work the night shift, which is notable in a society where you rarely see women out after sunset in rural areas. Hima C, as she is known, is a 27-year-old driver – an assistant “loco-pilot”, as it is called. The shifts don’t bother her because she loves her job. “The metro is elevated, so it soars over the city.

On Monday, Gavin Newsom lambasted the unanticipated disruptions on Friday and Saturday as “unacceptable”. “We failed to predict and plan for these shortages, and that’s unacceptable,” Newsom said at a press conference. “I have taken responsibility as your governor to immediately address this issue to move forward and ensure it simply never happens again.” He signed an emergency proclamation allowing some energy users and utilities to use backup sources during peak times. Still, millions of Californians could be subject to more rolling blackouts this week, according to the state’s largest electrical grid manager, the California Independent System Operator (ISO). On Monday, the California ISO said it will probably order utility companies to turn off power starting around 4pm local time, as demand for electricity to cool homes soars during the hottest part of the day. Steve Berberich, California ISO’s CEO and president, said that the state is short about 4,400 megawatts, meaning that up to 3.3m homes may lose power, and those affected can expect to lose power for about two hours. He did not say where the outages might occur, which are up to the state’s utilities. The electricity outages have arrived as the coronavirus pandemic continues to devastate the state, and amid a bout of dramatic weather that brought on lightning storms, fire tornadoes, and a near-record temperature of 54.4C (129.9F) to California’s Death Valley. The recent outages were not triggered – as past power shutoffs have been – as a safety measure to prevent wildfires from sparking. Rather, they were caused by energy supply issues. Californians seeking to cool their homes as temperatures soared into triple digits caused a surge in the demand for electricity through the weekend. Demand is likely to exceed supply early this week as the broiling, record breaking heatwave persists. The lack of electricity could be especially devastating now, while Americans have been encouraged to stay home in order to slow the spread of coronavirus – and air-conditioned malls, libraries and other indoor public gathering spaces remain closed. Heatwaves have deadly consequences, especially for poor, minority, older and unhoused populations – and extreme heat kills more Americans than all other natural disasters combined. While hundreds of thousands were unable to run their air conditioners during outages, many more lack access to AC, or are unable to pay electrical bills – and are especially vulnerable this week. “I was utterly astonished when it happened on Friday,” said David Marcus, an energy consultant based in Bay Area and a former adviser to the California Energy Commission. The ISO, a non-profit entity that regulates electricity for most of California, said it ordered rolling outages that cut off power to more than 410,000 homes and businesses for three and a half hours on Friday evening after the “unexpected loss” of a 470-megawatt power plant and 1,000 megawatts of wind power. The ISO issued a second, shorter outage on Saturday evening that cut power to more than 200,000 customers. The authority also issued an advisory through Wednesday, calling for Californians to voluntarily conserve electricity by setting their thermostats at 78F or higher and turning off unnecessary appliances. Both outages were issued in the evening when energy generated from solar power began to decline as the sun set. But the ISO’s reasoning doesn’t quite add up, Marcus told the Guardian. Solar production by definition goes down in the evening – “that should have come as no surprise to anyone”. Energy use also trends down as the sun sets and the temperature cools. “So I have no idea why the blackouts happened.” The ISO has traditionally ordered a stage 3 alert that triggers the state’s largest utility companies to cut power to some customers when the state energy reserves are at or lower than 3%. On Saturday, the operating reserves stood at 8.9% when the ISO issued a stage 3 alert, Marcus said. “I’m extremely curious to see what explanation they’ll have as to why they turned people’s lights off when they had 8.9% in reserves – when they told citizens they wouldn’t do that until they reached 3% reserves.” An annual outlook published by the ISO predicted a 1% chance that rolling outages would occur in 2020. “To me, they had adequate access to power, but they did not manage those assets properly,” said Bill Powers, an energy consultant based in San Diego. “Fundamentally, they dropped the ball.” Powers blames the energy authority’s focus on cost efficiency – which may have disincentivized the ISO to operate older, more expensive to run power plants as backup sources ahead of heatwaves. It is notable that public utilities that do not belong to the ISO – including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District – did not have blackouts on Friday. “To me, that says public utilities are just more cognizant of the need to serve their customers and not just used them as a profit base,” Power said. This weekend’s rolling blackouts were the first since the 2001 energy crisis, when energy traders from Enron Corp and other companies took advantage of loopholes in the states newly-deregulated electricity system and withheld power to drive up prices. In an alert issued on Sunday, the ISO said the heatwave “is causing a strain on supplies, and consumers should be prepared for likely rolling outages during the late afternoons and early evenings through Wednesday”. The power grid manager did not immediately respond to queries from the Guardian.

Its 2015 NDC set a target of reducing emissions by up to 130 MtCO2e (million tonnes of CO2 equivalent) by 2030 compared with a business-as-usual scenario, a target that many analysts have described as inadequate. Assessing progress towards this modest goal has also proved impossible – the kingdom has not published any official projections of its emissions nor even defined the business-as-usual baseline it is measuring against. Independent assessments have concluded that based on the scant information that is available, the country is not on track to meet its pledge. Yet under the influence of its young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia aims to reduce its dependence on oil in the decades ahead in recognition its supplies are not infinite, demand is falling and the world is searching for less destructive alternatives. To that end, it has announced a slew of environmental initiatives, including plans to generate 50% of the kingdom’s energy from renewables by 2030 and to plant 10bn trees, that have raised hopes it will take a more ambitious plan to Glasgow in November. In remarks to a state media agency, Prince Mohammed drew a direct link between the climate crisis and the health of Saudi citizens, signalling a potential shift in the Saudi attitude towards environmental issues. Analysts say achieving serious cuts in Saudi emissions would require significant changes that will be politically unpopular. Earlier grand announcements including plans to build massive solar farms have also failed to translate into meaningful action. But the Gulf state appears to be recognising that weaning itself off fossil fuels is becoming a political and economic imperative, as well as an environmental one. Michael Safi South Africa South Africa published a draft updated NDC last month (March), with ambitious targets to limit its annual greenhouse gas emissions to 398-440 MtCO2e by 2030, but many campaigners and analysts raised significant concerns about its continuing commitment to coal, which supplies 85% of South Africa’s power. A combination of the Covid-19 pandemic and a long term economic shift away from extractive industries and manufacturing has already helped South Africa move towards meeting some of its emission goals, but further progress will depend on massive investment in the country’s power sector, improvements in energy efficiency, a green transport strategy and a carbon tax. Gwede Mantashe, minister of mineral resources and energy, last month announced plans for a £2bn investment in renewables to accelerate a shift from coal power generation, but again there are concerns that few of the measures outlined in the updated draft NDC are likely to be implemented in a timely fashion, if at all. “South Africa’s target is far too weak … Our government’s answer is basically that they are going to continue polluting a lot for decades to come, but a little less more than they were going to do before,” said Dr Alex Lenferna, secretary of South Africa’s Climate Justice Coalition. South Africa has suffered rolling power cuts over recent years, which have dealt a crippling blow to an already struggling economy, and are forecast to continue for at least five years. But money is short. South Africa has already accessed about $2bn a year in 2018 and 2019 to meet adaptation and mitigation needs but will need four times more annually by 2030 to meet the targets laid out in the NDC. Jason Burke in Johannesburg China While China’s leader, Xi Jinping, pledged in September 2020 that China will increase its NDC commitments in order to peak the country’s carbon emissions before 2030, details of how it would get there have not yet been released. That “increased ambition” so far is not seen as ambitious enough; Climate Action Tracker, for instance, still rates China’s commitments as “highly insufficient”. Reality paints a bleak picture. Recent major infrastructure investments as part of a Covid-19 stimulus package, and the new carbon emissions from furious steel, cement and glass production, coupled with three straight years of rollbacks on regulations restricting approvals of new coal-fired power plants, have clouded China’s ambitions. Greenpeace findings released at the end of March suggest 46.1 GW of new coal capacity was greenlit in 2020, more than the combined total in the three previous years. For Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer at Greenpeace East Asia, clarity is still needed about whether or not China will introduce additional ambition over Xi’s pledge last autumn, something that would be key to determining whether China could peak closer to 2025 than 2030. “One should really pay attention to the new ambition as opposed to the release of the [new] NDC, obviously the new ambition is the weighty stuff,” Li said. But a joint statement issued by the US and China on Saturday has given some cause for optimism. Li welcomed the development. “The statement in my view is as positive as the politics would allow: it sends a very unequivocal message that on this particular issue [China and the US] will cooperate. Before the meetings in Shanghai this was not a message that we could assume.” Michael Standaert in Shenzen Mexico Mexico was once considered an international climate leader. It was the first developing country to submit an NDC in 2015. Its NDC pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions 22% and black carbon emissions by 51% by 2030. Conditional reductions of 36% and 70% were also promised. But its 2020 NDC disappointed climate campaigners, who said the country isn’t pursuing more ambitious targets. “It should have been more ambitious to begin with [and] their target is to reduce emissions to business as usual,” said Carolina Herrera of the Natural Resources Defense Council, who called Mexico’s NDC “utterly deficient” and “disappointing”. Mexico’s NDC promises nature based solutions such as protecting coastlines and reforestation, and plans also include refurbishing hydroelectric projects. The country also promises to slash emissions to 50% below 2000 levels by 2050. But meanwhile, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has actively moved against clean energy. His government cancelled clean energy auctions. He pushed an electricity industry law through Congress in March, which forces the state-owned electricity company to dispatch energy from its own (often dirty) power plants over privately owned renewable producers. The president also promised to revive the coal industry and has pushed the construction of a behemoth refinery in south-eastern Tabasco state. “They’re favouring the public fossil fuel sector at the expense of renewable energy and, frankly, their own citizens,” said Herrera, manager for green finance and climate change at the NRDC’s Latin America Project. David Agren Australia Australia’s most recent NDC just repeated the 2030 emissions reduction target set at the Paris summit: a 26-28% cut below 2005 emissions levels. No rationale has been given. The government had been advised to set a target equivalent to a 45-60% cut. Instead it just mirrored the reduction number set by the US under Barack Obama, but pushed the timeframe back five years. Prime minister Scott Morrison has not set a net zero emissions target, saying only that the country would “preferably” reach that mark by 2050. Quite how that may happen is not clear. The government has not introduced substantial climate policies, and official government projections suggest it will fall short of what is widely considered an unambitious 2030 target. There has been some progress. National emissions are already 18% below 2005 levels (largely due to cuts when the Labor opposition was in power) and cheap renewable energy is transforming the power grid at a rate faster than expected. But Australia still gets most of its electricity from burning coal, and emissions from the transport, mining and agriculture sectors are forecast to increase over the decade. The Morrison government says it is taking a “technology, not taxes” approach to the climate crisis, but to date has committed just A$18bn over a decade to technologies including hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and soil carbon. Critics have pointed out it has not explained how or when this approach will deliver emissions cuts. Adam Morton in Sydney Brazil More ambition is needed, say representatives from agribusiness, finance and academia, and business leaders. “Brazil was expected to present a more ambitious target than the previous one. We didn’t do that,” Carolina Genin, director of the climate programme at World Resources Institute Brasil, said. “In absolute terms, our ambition is lower.” The 2020 NDC kept the pledge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 37% by 2025, and 43% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. But climate experts warned that the new NDC increases emissions by at least 400 MtCO2e, compared with the targets submitted in 2015. To maintain the same absolute level of emissions, Brazil should update the cut to 57% by 2030, experts say. Jair Bolsonaro’s government, however, thinks the opposite. In the proposal submitted in December 2020, it said its NDC is “among the most ambitious in the world” and that, “as a developing country and a nation of late industrialization, Brazil’s historical contribution to climate change has been low”. The proposal has one page for the NDC and eight for the information annexe, which is shorter than that from neighbours such as Argentina, Peru and Colombia. It also lacks details on how targets will be met, according to Genin: “We expected progress in sectoral goals, which were in the first NDC and do not appear in the second. These are important goals such as zero illegal deforestation, a commitment to restore 12 million hectares, among others.” Brazil has been successful in combating deforestation of the Amazon in the past, a key factor in the country’s contribution to climate mitigation, “but the picture reversed dramatically in recent years”, Genin added. Ricardo Salles, the minister of the environment, said it can reduce by 40% in one year the fast-paced deforestation of the Amazon – but only if the country receives US$1bn in foreign aid. Flávia Milhorance in Rio de Janeiro Nigeria Nigeria plans to achieve emissions reductions by massively expanding solar energy production in the country, investing in alternative renewable energy and improving processes used to produce oil and gas. It will use more natural gas and limit gas flaring. It also hopes to bring solar power to 5m households or roughly 25 million people. For now, however, these remain ambitions. In 2015 Nigeria pledged a 20% reduction in its annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in relative terms, based on what it is projected to emit. The pledge was updated in 2017, spelling out Nigeria’s commitments in more detail, but the fundamentals of its pledges were the same. Since 2015 progress has been very slow, with some reports of regression. Nigeria’s pledges were based on the economy growing by 5% a year, roughly where economic growth was at the time of the agreement. The economy has been in recession twice since 2015, in one of the toughest periods in a generation for Africa’s largest economy and oil producer. This is in part caused by steep drops in crude oil prices on which Nigeria still heavily relies. A major part of Nigeria’s economic plan has been to expand the agriculture sector and make it more productive, implementing policies which critics say will increase emissions. Emmanuel Akinwotu in Lagos Canada The government of Justin Trudeau has cast itself as climate champions. In 2015, Canada initially committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. A reduction of that scope would see emissions in the country from the current rate of about 730 megatonnes down to 511 megatonnes. But the reality is far different, with a report this week showing emissions have only dropped 1% below 2005 levels – far off course. “The trend is very clear: we’re still on track to miss our Paris pledge by quite a lot,” said Jessica Green, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto who specialises in climate governance. “We just don’t see what the interim steps are that will put us on the path to meet those targets.” Governing Liberals have introduced legislation that would legally bind the government to net zero by 2050, but the bill has not yet progressed throughout parliament. The bulk of Canada’s emissions come from its tar sands – one of the world’s largest petroleum reserves. Emissions from the tar sands continue to rise each year. A recent court victory has received hopes for a nationwide carbon tax, which the government plans to raise to $170/tonne by 2030. But Green cautions the fight will probably be “politically difficult”, and one that might not be as effective as other policy measures, including electrifying parts of the country’s power grid that remain reliant on fossil fuels, making public transit free – and shutting down the tar sands. Unlike many other industrialised nations, Canada has never met any of its emissions reduction targets – a custom the governing Liberals promised to end. “I think that there’s kind of more openness to this idea that the government needs to really intervene more strongly,” said Green. But at the same time, there are still a lot of political challenges to make that a reality.

According to the national energy emissions audit published by the Australia Institute, South Australia has had lower monthly wholesale electricity prices than Victoria since January, than New South Wales since August and than Queensland and Tasmania for the past two months. It is the first time the state has had cheaper wholesale power than all other states for consecutive months. It coincided with the percentage of electricity from wind and solar energy in the state reaching nearly 65% in November. Hugh Saddler, the author of the monthly audit and an associate professor at the Australian National University, said wind and solar power supplied more than 50% of the electricity generated in South Australia for most months over the past two years. “That’s made electricity in SA the cheapest in the national electricity market and dramatically increased reliability.” Saddler said the benefits would be increased if a proposed new interconnector was built between South Australia and NSW as it would ensure NSW had access to solar power into the early evening, helping improve management of demand during peak periods. The audit comes as different reports tell competing stories on electricity prices. The annual report of the Australian Energy Market Commission earlier this month found household prices were expected to start falling over the next few years, mostly due to decreases in wholesale costs as clean energy generation capacity, particularly from windfarms, increased. On Sunday, the competition watchdog found Australian households had already saved $65 on their power bills over the past year, but it said electricity affordability required further attention, in part because while solar panels reduced bills for households that had them, others shouldered the cost of feed-in tariff incentive schemes. According to the website Open NEM, 25.9% of electricity in the five eastern states has been from renewable sources over the past month. There was 100% clean generation in Tasmania, which runs on hydro power, 60% in South Australia, 25% in Victoria, 18% in NSW and 16% in Queensland. The most recent federal government emissions projections suggest it expects Australia to reach 50% clean energy by 2030. The Coalition accused Labor of being economically reckless when it set a non-binding 50% renewable energy target over that timeframe before the election. The Australia Institute audit supports government analysis that found Australia was not expected to meet its 2030 emissions reduction target – a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels – unless it relied on a controversial accounting measure. The measure, which involves claiming credit for beating previous targets under the expiring Kyoto protocol, was strongly opposed by several countries at the recent UN climate talks in Madrid. Saddler found a brief fall in diesel fuel sales had been reversed, suggesting emissions from transport would continue to rise while there was no credible policies to reduce them. He found an ongoing reduction in emissions from electricity generation – due to the rise of clean energy – was likely to be completely offset by rising pollution from transport, mining and agriculture. The audit compares emissions over the five years before the repeal of the former carbon price scheme with the five years since it was abolished. While recent changes to government emissions data now suggest pollution has been lower under the Coalition than under Labor, the report found that if emissions from the land were excluded from national accounts and the focus was solely on fossil fuel industries, pollution trended down between 2009 and 2014 and had trended upwards since. “The emissions reduction fund, which commenced in 2014, has certainly done much less to reduce emissions than the carbon price did … It is, in fact, hard to see that it has had any significant impact,” the audit report says. “The government’s most recent projections of emissions over the next 10 years indicate very little further reduction. If Australia is to meet its Paris agreement target without using Kyoto carryover credits (for which there is no legal basis), another 13% emissions reduction will be required.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/live/2022/jun/26/sunday-at-glastonbury-the-build-to-kendrick-lamar-lorde-and-pet-shop-boys","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-26T23:49:27Z","webTitle":"Sunday at Glastonbury: Kendrick Lamar, Diana Ross and Jack White – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2022/jun/26/sunday-at-glastonbury-the-build-to-kendrick-lamar-lorde-and-pet-shop-boys","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/live/2022/jun/26/sunday-at-glastonbury-the-build-to-kendrick-lamar-lorde-and-pet-shop-boys","fields":{"headline":"Sunday at Glastonbury: Kendrick Lamar, Diana Ross and Jack White – as it happened","bodyText":"And that’s it for our live Glastonbury coverage this year – the bacchanalian post-Covid festival, the first in three years, the long-delayed 50th birthday celebration. As ever we’ve had some of the biggest and most enduring stars of musical history play for us here, alongside emerging talent and a huge side-helping of joyful nonsense. I hope you’ve enjoyed our running commentary on this most festival of festivals – an event that I’ve always seen as a coming-together of all the best bits of British culture. It’s been so great to be back. There’ll be a gallery of photos at 6am tomorrow and the next Politics Weekly podcast will be a Glastonbury special. We’re off into the night to ride the last waves of serotonin out here. Until next year! …and Alexis Petridis’s review of Kendrick’s concluding headliner set is in: “Whatever else he may be, he certainly isn’t one of those performers who keeps beaming at the Glastonbury audience, shaking his head in disbelief and telling you how grateful he is to be here – although towards the end of the set he spends a surprisingly lengthy period of time just walking backwards and forwards across the stage in silence, staring at the crowd and nodding his head as if taking its sheer size in. But he sounds amazing: as technically gifted a rapper as has emerged in recent years. Live, he delivers his astonishing flows with a kind of HD clarity.” Other stage, 9.40pm Much has been made of the advanced age of some of this year’s Glastonbury stage headliners, as if this represented some kind of lack of imagination on behalf of the bookers. But that limited mindset discounts the massive contributions that these venerable artists have made to pop history, not to mention the continued pertinence of the most vital among them. Arguably – and I would argue it to the death – that is Pet Shop Boys, who draw one of the vastest (and most euphoric) crowds on the Other stage all weekend for a victory lap of their greatest hits, most of which still bite fiercely hard today. Although it’s basically the same set they’ve been touring in arenas recently, there’s not a shred of complacency here: opener Suburbia stings with Neil Tennant’s imperious sneer; Can You Forgive Her has a haughty strut; Tennant, having removed his Daft Punk-style glittery, horned helmet, sounds lacerating and scabrous on Opportunities. Oddly, it takes a while for Chris Lowe to appear on stage. “The other one will reveal himself shortly,” Tennant says before their mash-up of U2’s The Streets Have No Name and Can’t Take My Eyes Off You, though it still takes a while for his fabulously petulant foil to appear. There’s no explanation for his absence other than a “technical hitch”. Regardless, Tennant’s evident delight at the euphoria they’re greeted with makes up for Lowe’s initial absence. Personally, I think the PSBs remain underrated, a lesser-celebrated act of their era; I’m 33 and I didn’t really grow up hearing their songs. Tonight feels like a national reclamation of the synth-pop heroes, which Tennant seems to recognise. They are such masters of duality: Left to My Own Devices switches between frenzy and dreaminess; Domino Dancing is intermittently warm and sad; Losing My Mind (originally sung by Liza Minelli) is at once uninhibitedly sexy and entirely possessed. I think I’ve been to Glastonbury about seven times, and this the best set I’ve ever seen. I genuinely can’t imagine being any happier than in this moment. There are rumours that they’re going to bring Kylie Minogue on, though the only guest we ultimately get is Olly Alexander of Years and Years for Dreamland, one of their better latter-day songs. (Sadly, The Pop Kids, a gem from their 2016 album Super, is absent from this tour’s setlist.) His voice is a little insipid next to Tennant’s worldly brogue, which reels with disgust during the sardonic It’s a Sin, and purrs during the fabulous Shep Pettibone remix of West End Girls (the greatest song of all time, if you ask me). It imbues their set with both experience and tenderness, a sense of hope juxtaposed with thwarted reality. And none more so than their final song. “Tonight, we dedicate our set to the victims of the appalling crime at Oslo Pride,” Tennant says before a serene, graceful, utterly gorgeous rendition of Being Boring. “I never dreamt that I would get to be the creature that I always meant to be,” he sings, his awe at hard-won self-fulfilment profoundly intact. West Holts - 9.45pm And the award for the loudest set of the weekend goes to Bicep, dead keen not to let Kendrick blow them out of the water. You can hear it all the way from the edges of the Pyramid stage, and they want to blow everyone’s tiny minds with their airy ambient-rave and visual extravaganza. Alas, this also means that you can hear when the bass is very out of sync. It’s a disappointing start for a duo who have popped off in the past year and can now fill festival fields. They’re the next in a lineage of massive chompy electronic live acts such as Leftfield, Orbital, Chemical Brothers and Underworld, laying on the lasers for the part-time ravers. Compared to those 90s titans, however, their euphoric spangle-dance does sound fairly lightweight. Bicep are two Irish disco-heads who started off as DJs with a blog dedicated to Italo, and have now struck upon a formula that’s rejuvenated veteran ravers and inspired the part-time millennial ones. They pare their tracks back and coast along on a slow-building crescendo, heavy on choral cooing that sounds a bit like the Headspace app’s gone off at 4am in your tent. The buildup goes on long but finally climaxes with concrete-blasting drums and abstracted, souped-up trance, plus genuinely excellent trippy-by-numbers visuals that must have looked incredible for all the sofa ravers at home. Their Jon Hopkins-alike bouncy blooper Opal, off their eponymous 2017 album, gets big cheers from the bucket-hatted masses – who keep on pouring in, doing a halfy-halfy with Kendrick. A slightly reworked version of breakbeat-heavy Glue, meanwhile, is a juddering homage to acid-house. It’s an epic set, even if you can’t shake the impression that, deep down, Bicep are making My First Rave Music (you can tell because much of the audience is just having a nice chat). Still, you can’t knock accessibility: maybe Bicep will prove the gateway drug into a heady, more diverse world of house. For now, they’ve more than proved themselves to be the next Orbital. While all that best-in-class rap was going on at the Pyramid, we had house/electronic duo Bicep at West Holts, Australian singer-songwriter Courtney Barnett up at the Park, and Charli XCX at John Peel. The late-night areas of the festival are gearing up for one last night of debauchery before everyone hauls their camping equipment (and the empty shells of their bodies) homewards. Some photos to recap that astonishing Kendrick set. Our review from Alexis Petridis is coming soon. That was easily one of the best sets I’ve ever seen on the Pyramid, and one that I can’t wait to see again on a small screen to be able to pore over all the detail. It felt like a production by Ivo Van Hove or Crystal Pite – something between contemporary dance and avant garde theatre, with such rich, deep, symbolic human movement. The biggest thrill though was just hearing that flow up close and in the air: every consonant so supernaturally crisp, as if he’s telling you something you absolutely have to understand. He makes you feel like the stakes are very high indeed – and, of course, they are. His call for women’s rights at the climax was electrifying and an appropriate ending to a festival where plenty of artists have decried the Supreme Court’s dreadful decision. The Pet Shop Boys on the Other Stage dedicated their Aids crisis song Being Boring to the victims of the shooting in Oslo before the city’s planned Pride celebrations. It was by all accounts an amazing set over there as well – what a closing night! Apparently nobody in the crowd thought the set had ended – I also wasn’t ready for the end of one of the most theatrical Glastonbury performances ever, to be quite honest. It’s a sombre and powerful ending. Kendrick is not shy about his faith - it is rare to have Christian faith mentioned in such passionate and evangelistic terms on this stage. Lamar’s crown of barbed wire thorns is not blasphemous, but an attempt to remind the audience of the violence committed against (and the sacrifice of) Jesus. So much to unpack here! The female dancers are back and they are the total opposite of their graceful former selves, now violently punching the air - just as men were before. Motifs of frustration and anger return. “They judge you they judge Christ, godspeed for women’s rights!” He shouts this over and over to a furious peak. He can barely open his eyes because of all the blood from his crown. The words “your saviour I am not” are emblazoned across the background. An incredible piece of theatre from Kendrick just then. “I was locked up in LA during the pandemic. You feel like family... I see so many faces. Different creed, different colours... Imperfection is beautiful, no matter what they going through. I’m wearing this crown. They judge you, they judge Christ. We’re going to do our best to follow in his image.” And blood pours down from his crown and into his white shirt. Surely not a controversial opinion at this point to say that this beats Kanye’s headline set from 2015, if we’re playing superstar-US-rapper Top Trumps. Lonely Hearts Club, 7.45pm Watching Riz Ahmed take to Glastonbury’s Lonely Hearts Club stage you can’t help but wonder: how on earth does he have the time? The English-Pakistani actor has an academy award and an Emmy under his belt and also somehow has the capacity to maintain a side career as a rapper. Known for both his solo project and his group with Heems, the Swet Shop Boys, Ahmed uses his music to air his frustrations with a world that is increasingly racist and Islamophobic, his latest record, The Long Goodbye, being a dense, heartbroken reckoning with the UK’s relationship with the South Asian diaspora. Still, acting is Ahmed’s day job for a reason: although he’s got plenty to say and possesses seemingly boundless charm, his Sunday night set confirms that, musically, he’s still caught in the vortex of 2010s blog rap, his lyrics filled with clumsy jokes and awkward turns of phrase. His set’s most potent moments arrive during songs such as Deal With It, a ferocious track set to a warped, blown-out Bollywood sample, or Karma, when he jumps into the crowd, surrounding himself with fans. Even in these moments, though, Ahmed has to compete with the sound of Years &amp; Years, playing a few hundred yards away. Although he shines on screen, on stage Ahmed can’t help but fade away. Laura Snapes in the Pet Shop Boys crowd, meanwhile, says it’s the best she’s been in all weekend - and West End Girls has just started! The Pyramid stage has just been graced by Lamar’s performance of Humble under raining red fireworks, after a contemporary dance interlude in which the male dancers walked impassively as the women gracefully turned away. The energy is back up in the crowd, with everyone back to shouting lyrics back at the stage, and the inevitable flares are going up. “I’m so sick and tired of the Photoshop! Show me somethin’ natural like afro on Richard Pryor! Show me somethin’ natural like ass with some stretch marks!” - just a sample of some favourite lines there. John Peel stage, 9.30pm For those feeling faded on Sunday night at Glastonbury, Charli XCX on the John Peel tent is a shot in the arm, bringing her full-throttle pop firepower to the stage. As she points out, though, she too has been partying and “is hanging on by a thread”. I have seen Charli XCX play three times in the past few months, and somehow she gets better every time. This is a performer at the peak of her powers, polished, poised and with crowdpleasing yet enduringly personal pop. Part of Charli’s appeal is her take-no-prisoners approach to performing – she doesn’t lure you in, as Lorde did on the Pyramid stage, so much as step on your neck and demand that you take notice. There are a few concessions for her headline slot audience tonight, notably the inclusion of her effervescent collaboration with Icona Pop, I Love It – excluded from earlier sets – and party 4 u, dedicated to her day-one fans. Any time spent with Charli is guaranteed to be a good one. Worth emphasising how incredibly clear Kendrick is on the mic. The enunciation of literally every syllable is so rounded and crisp. He is actually superhuman - you need such a razor sharp mind and intellect to even deliver this material in the way he does, quite apart from the lyrics, which are also some of the greatest around at the moment (and arguably ever). Lamar is on to Loyalty now. The line of women in red return, following him around the stage – a really elegant symbol for the song’s title and subject. The relaxed demeanour from earlier has evaporated now. He’s still confident and absolutely precise in his flow, but also raw and heavy, politically, musically and lyrically. In Element, Kendrick really played around with his delivery – melodically, this is very different. The crowd is slightly quieter now as he says – the trouble with this one is that it’s hard to shout the lyrics back perfectly because he’s just so technically strong. Kendrick is surrounded by a circle of men who explode out into frantic shadowboxing - a properly aggressive rendition of a track about genocidal racism. It feels so important to have this on the Pyramid stage. Left Field stage Headlining the Left Field stage on Sunday is Yola, the British musician and actress born Yolanda Claire Quartey who first made waves in 2019 with her debut album Walk Through Fire. That record earned her a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist, but it’s her latest project that’s sparked the most discussion: Yola plays rock legend Sister Rosetta Tharpe in Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis biopic. Much like the Elvis movie, though, Yola’s Left Field set can’t help but feel like a tribute act. Her voice is sublime and her band is tight, but these songs just don’t hold water: heavily referencing and borrowing from classic rock and soul standards, they feel more like hold music than the emphatic, powerful tracks that Yola insists they are. A mid-set cover of Elton John’s Goodbye Yellow Brick Road proves that these songs lack oomph: it’s the only point in the set that’s a certified festival moment. Kendrick’s backing dancers right now are like a ghostly parade of figures who waft across the stage and just leave again with no interaction with Kendrick. Such drama! His backdrop has changed: it now reads “they want us to bow” - and we’re into Blacker the Berry from To Pimp a Butterfly A brief interruption in our Kendrick commentary to say that Jack White was amazing earlier, playing a secret set full of everything from the Raconteurs to the White Stripes to all of his solo material - there was even a Dead Weather song. Read our review: Kendrick is throwing huge crowd-pleaser Alright out there surprisingly early. Dude’s got RANGE. Big Defund the Police vibe in the crowd as everybody shouts “and we hate po-po, want to kill us in the street for sho” Meanwhile at the Pet Shop Boys: Chris Lowe has finally appeared. We have been given absolutely no explanation as to his absence thus far. People in the crowd know EVERY word, it seems – and Lamar is not a rapper who’s easy to keep up with. Any fears that this would be a chinstrokey set dominated by the latest, more introspective album are being put to rest. We’ve got hand waving, crowd chants – proper arena performance tactics. Aaaah, it’s King Kunta! What a song. He’s loosening up, doing lots of ad-libs, transforming into a proper party MC suddenly. It’s an immediate change of tone – is there nothing he can’t do!? On Count Me Out, Kendrick goes full European avant garde, surrounded by dancers in flowing red dresses, swirling around him. The rappers who headline the Pyramid bring so much theatre in different ways: art-installation minimalism from Kanye, joyful circus and ballet by Stormzy, and now this. Park stage, 7.45pm Up on the Park stage for Jarvis Cocker, it’s impossible not to think of Pulp’s 2011 secret set up here and the furious joy of hearing their greatest hits live for the first time in years. Knowing that he’s withholding these wonderful songs makes his set a touch frustrating, especially as it initially dwells on fairly languid material – a song about the frustrations of satnav, the minimalist theme for the BBC drama This Is Going to Hurt, a lounge lizardy dirge (a new song) about lockdown. “The longest night in human history has got me glued to my seat,” he sings, as captivating a performer as ever with his loose limbs and floppy wrists and tweed jacket. At one point he chucks sweets into the crowd to assuage our flagging Sunday-night energy levels, but the true enlivener comes when his set gets aggro and Cocker assumes his right and proper livewire form. Further Complications is post-punk with a rude, lurching riff that boils over at the climax; there is industrial clangour accompanied by the arresting sight of him bent backwards. He finds purpose with an adapted rendition of Running the World, swapping the C-word for “pricks” because it’s being broadcast on TV. “We’re singing it over the ocean because there’s a decision that’s been made by mainly men telling women what they can do with their bodies,” he explains, “so this is for those guys.” It’s louche and sardonic and Cocker holds up a middle finger as he sings, “screw the morals / does it make any money?” As he pauses for suspense, you’d expect the crowd to roar back, but instead there’s a defeated feeling of reality descending: no defiance to be had here, more the sense that the song’s message holds regrettably, irretrievably true. At the very least, he brings us back to a message of liberation with closer House Music All Night Long, with its seductive, overdriven grind. “We’re free,” he says. Kendrick seems totally relaxed and in command up there - his dancers march and sway around him but he’s there, surrounded by torchlights on a darkened stage, delivering lines perfectly. He’s mesmerising. Snares sounding huge. He’s playing quite a lot from Good Kid, Maad City so far. “I need my day ones out here tonight!” The incredible troupe of dancers is marching in matching white shirts and suit trousers - as Ben observes, this is Akram Khan/Crystal Pite levels of movement design. We can always expect a beautiful and provocative performance from Kendrick. The next song is Swimming Pools (Drank) - the crowd have their hands up and Kendrick is masterful on stage, solo now, directing the exuberant audience Kendrick’s now on the swaggering, ego-centric track Backstreet Freestyle - a guitar-heavy rendition that gives it even more swagger. Have you ever heard thousands of people scream that they pray their dick gets big as the Eiffel Tower? Now you have. Meanwhile on the Other Stage, the Pet Shop Boys have arrived, though Chris Lowe is not yet on stage. Neil says: “Glastonbury, good evening! We are the Pet Shop Boys. The other one will reveal himself shortly. Tonight we welcome you to a dreamworld... being boring is a sin, the music plays forever and the streets have no name.” Kendrick is - of course - wearing a thorn of crowns with diamonds. Huge guitar soloing for Money Trees - everybody in the crowd is calling each other “ya bish” Hi folks - this is Keza taking over again just in time for Kendrick’s headline set, as Ben sprints to the Pyramid Stage. You ready for the greatest rapper of our times? As the sun sets on the Pyramid stage on the final night of the festival, a blissed-out crowd gathers for Lorde – who, surprise surprise, has ditched her trademark dark locks for honey blonde. Our Ella (Yelich-O’Connor) is an energetic and always engaging presence on stage, bounding along its length in a white leotard, red fishnet tights and sensible Doc Martens – but it seems she’s also well aware of her spot on the billing, and how fragile the audience might be feeling after at least three days in the wilderness of Worthy Farm. “I am very fucking gassed to be back at the Pyramid stage,” she says, referring to her primetime spot in 2017. This time, she tells us, she appreciates the responsibility of the Sunday evening slot: “You’re probably brutally hungover now, I understand, maybe on the comedown – and I love that, because I really am the comedown shepherd.” With that Yelich-O’Connor ushers us into a hazy sundowner set, with The Path, the album’s po-faced opener, setting the tone: welcome to the temple of Lorde, let her wash over you and return you to health. She’s a summer baby, she tells us, and her sundial centrepiece on stage and yellow-suited band set an appropriately restorative tone – but beyond the set dressing, you’re struck by her ironclad songwriting, immediately compelling enough to draw people in from other stages. By the time her set is done, she’s filled the Pyramid stage, with The Louvre (from 2017’s Melodrama) a notable pull. That, plus her assured performance, makes it easy to forget that she is only 25; as fan favourite Ribs goes to show, she is a wunderkindw riting songs that are far more self-aware and poignant than her years would suggest. “I wrote this song when I was 15 years old,” she says, “which means some of you might have been listening to it for ten years.” No wonder it feels like a moment, for her and us. Yes, the biggest scream and sing-along is reserved for Royals, but the rest of the set demonstrates how versatile and dynamic she is as an artist, down to her fantastically funky cover of Banararama’s Cruel Summer. Secrets From a Girl Who’s Seen It All – what might feel like forgettable filler on her latest album – comes alive when performed in part due to Lorde’s chatty, languorous manner. Likewise Stoned At the Nail Salon, for which Arlo Parks and Clairo join her on stage, in a performance that seems as much a girls’ night sleepover as Glastonbury main stage. But Lorde can do both: cosy and full throttle, as the outpouring of foot-stomping catharsis that greets Green Light (“a British song,” she says) goes to show. “I become very powerful, and I can get away with almost anything,” she says of the mood boost from her favourite season. By the time she concludes her set with recent single Solar Power, as the sun dips beneath the Pyramid and she urges us to “be safe, be happy, be healthy; wear sunscreen, protect the bees”, you are convinced of her star power, too. Our photographer David Levene was on stage with Jack White – jealous! Courtney Barnett is on the Park stage, jangling stridently. The climax of the festival is just bonkers good: her, Suzanne Vega, Bicep, Pet Shop Boys and Kendrick Lamar all playing concurrently. Turns out you can have an intra-Glasto form of fomo. Lots of people still swooning over Diana’s set – between her and Macca there have been some bucket lists thoroughly ticked. Just bask in the sheer fabulousness. Ok the wifi has been thoroughly hydrated, told that it’s only got one more night of raving, been given a vegan burrito and now it’s saying that we can hopefully carry on and do one last rager. The internet network here is the equivalent of a Glasto festivalgoer who’s been drinking all day and is slowly wheezing with sunstroke, so the updates are a little slower than usual. We’ll get it an espresso martini and try and get it back in the game soon. Angélique Kidjo is heading off stage at West Holts stage, having just led a huge singalong in the evening light to a joyfully bopping front few rows. Apparently Eminem has been spotted swimming at a classy members’ club nearby. Is he going to be coming on with Kendrick Lamar? Huge moment if so! Jarvis Cocker also joined the condemnation of Roe v Wade, renaming the – avert your eyes if you don’t like more potty-mouthed language – scabrously anti-authoritarian song Cunts Are Running the World. We’ve changed the words for today because it’s on telly, and that’s not the be all and end all. Usually it’s C-words are still running the world, but today it’s pricks running the world. We’re singing it over the ocean because there’s a decision that’s been made by mainly men telling women what they can do with their bodies, so this is for those guys. It’s been inspiring to see how many artists have taken a stand on this during the weekend: Olivia Rodrigo the most forthright, angry and specific, but there have been so many others. It’s perhaps such a glaring ethical failure that it’s easy to make a statement about, but it feels like we’ve moved on a lot in pop culture since the Brexit year at Glastonbury, when strident condemnations were pretty thin on the ground. Lorde’s Solar Power is sounding incredible floating over to our wee portacabin backstage – such a big, clear, open-hearted melody, exactly the kind that sends a Pyramid audience loopy. John Peel stage, 6.30pm The John Peel has been moshpit central this year, with Amyl and the Sniffers and Ukrainians Go_A inspiring circle pits, and Jamie T prompting some serious skanking last night. But even by those standards, Baltimore hardcore band Turnstile’s set is something else entirely. Bodies are flying everywhere, frequently that of vocalist Brendan Yates, who spends a decent chunk of the set crowd surfing, and the rest of it furiously slam dancing to the band’s monstrously heavy breakdowns. But Turnstile aren’t just about sheer brute force. Over the course of three albums they have evolved into something more than just a straightforward hardcore act, fusing R&amp;B, electronica and shoegaze into their sound on recent record Glow On, which featured guest appearances from the unlikely figure of Dev Hynes. They power through much of it tonight – the earwormy Mystery; Holiday, with its salsa-tinged rhythms; and the pulverising power-metal of TLC (Turnstile Love Connection). While drummer Daniel Fang stands out for his inventive, Latin-tinged rhythms and Duracell bunny nature, it’s hard to keep your eyes off Yates, one of the most dynamic and charismatic vocalists around right now. Bar a brief interlude when he crouches menacingly behind the drum kit, he never stops moving, contorting his body into strange shapes, lifting his mic stand above his head and leaping preposterously high into the air. Three songs in he’s disposed of his T-shirt; six songs in he embarks on his first crowdsurf, at the same time strumming away at an acoustic guitar he pinched off a fan; and by the end of the set he’s somehow convinced a sizeable chunk of the audience to climb on to the shoulders of the person next to them: a risky move in the middle of a circle pit. The result is one of the most thrilling and euphoric sets of the weekend – a cathartic burst of joy and fury. At the set’s close, Yates hops off the stage and shakes hands with the front row behind the crash barrier, revelling in a job well done. Rising Jamaican reggae star Koffee has had a wild few years: in 2020, she became the first woman, and youngest person ever, to win best reggae album at the Grammys, and rumours abound that she’s a featured player on the next Rihanna album. Over the course of the pandemic, she’s become something of a streaming star: her breakout single Toast, released in 2019, has received 129m streams on Spotify alone. There’s a lot of weight on the 22-year-old’s shoulders, then, as she takes to the West Holts stage on Sunday night – as evidenced by the sizeable crowd gathering to see her, an audience that far outnumbers that for Róisín Murphy, last night’s West Holts headliner. Taking to the stage wearing a chic silk shirt and matching shorts, both by the hyped luxury resortwear brand Casablanca, she is a sweet, compelling presence, casual in attitude but totally in control of her crowd. Although her band often overwhelms her vocals – powerful bass muffling any of the nuances in her words, the stadium-primed drum kit a constant distracting presence – Koffee’s voice is still a remarkable instrument, at turns husky, sweet, emphatic and lackadaisical. Even when the sound suffers, though, Koffee’s hooky, profoundly modern take on reggae shines through: W is a clear highlight, and Lockdown, one of the few non-cloying songs written about Covid quarantine, gets the powerful crowd singalong it deserves. It’s not the ideal scenario for someone on such a rapid ascent, but it proves that someone with this much charisma can weather any storm. Years &amp; Years are warming the crowd up very nicely for Pet Shop Boys by doing It’s a Sin. Lorde has meanwhile joined the chorus of disapproval about Roe v Wade, saying “fuck the Supreme Court”. And Jarvis Cocker is playing a new song about lockdown with the chorus: “Motherfuckers gonna fuck with this / Motherfuckers gonna get fucked up”. Potty mouths! It’s still going on, of course, but Alexis has written his review of the festival thus far: Other stage, 6pm Bringing some welcome Nashville razzle-dazzle, it’s Kacey Musgraves, resplendent in a tiny glittering mini-dress and, a knowing Glasto twist, Hunter wellies. “I see your cowboy hats, I know you know what yee-haw means,” she smiles, looking out at a crowd spotted with pink fluffy western numbers and breaking into her disco-fied song High Horse – her giddy-up Get Lucky. Country music has never been much one to boogie to – line-dancing, sure, but not gleeful shape-throwing – but Musgraves is a fearlessly genre-blending star. The occasional banjo gives her roots away, but her new territory is more Chic-style guitars, rock instrumentals, joyful jams and even, wonderfully, a Herbie Mann-rivally jazz flute solo, backed by a seven-piece band of hipster looking dudes in wacky sunglasses and beanie hats. At Primavera festival in Barcelona she reportedly spent a lot of her set dissing her ex-husband, the subject of her latest album Star-Crossed – and given the opening skit, its deeply dramatic flamenco-western title track with a burning heart behind her, you’d be forgiven for expecting that hell hath no fury like a country singer scorned. Her set might be spiky, perhaps. Pissed off. But Musgraves delivers a serene waft of pop that whirls in the Eagles, Neil Young, rock riffage and even on new song Breadwinner, a plucky piano hook that sounds like something from a Destiny’s Child or Craig David song. Her set is also a masterclass in stagecraft, switching between acoustic guitar and singing to the audience, arms-outstretched, charming as well as acerbic. “Honestly thinking about never going back to America. Anyone know any positions for sheep farming going, as that sounds really great right now,” she quips before playing the serene Golden Hour at – checks watch – golden hour, a lovely touch. It’s usually a bit naff when artists cover bands they’re inspired by or trying to emulate but her “Kacey-oke” version of Fleetwood Mac’s Dreams – complete with flashing lyrics on the big screen and her announcement of “let’s get our middle-aged white lady on” – gives it all a knowing wink. Musgraves says the last time she played Glastonbury was 2014, which, judging by the cheers when she asks, very few of the current crowd seem to have attended. It’s interesting that her audience today only half-fills the field; she hasn’t yet had a big song that cuts through in the UK as she might have done in the States. But soon she’s off to open for Adele in London, shows that may well gain her a new audience. You’re looking at country – but not as you know it. Jarvis Cocker – with his outfit Jarv Is – is on the Park, famously the site of a very overcrowded and very unhinged Pulp secret set one year. He’s playing the absolutely terrific song Must I Evolve?, in an excellent arrangement with horror-movie Hermann-style strings scraping and moaning. And on West Holts, Angélique Kidjo is doing one of her Talking Heads covers with some frenetic congas and fat organs. Meanwhile on the Other stage, Years &amp; Years’ Olly Alexander seems to have been taking wardrobe tips from Yves Tumor yesterday, continuing Tumor’s leather-daddy streetpunk aesthetic, but adding some striking dyed eyebrows and a haircut that’s half Mad Max extra, half inadvertent Adidas promotion. They’re playing Muscle and it’s suitably horny on main. I love how Lorde has someone on stage whose only job is to spin her round on a platform every so often. Impressive addition to a CV but ultimately not very transferrable skills. The stage set is really striking, with a giant pillar resting on a cylinder in a henge-like arrangement that chimes nicely with all the ancient megaliths of Somerset and surrounds. Only a few songs into her set and Lorde – who has a new blonde barnet – is bringing out the crowd-wowing moves, singing Stoned at the Nail Salon with Arlo Parks and Clairo. It’s a bit of a lightweight tune, but their rapport is lovely and it certainly is a perfect mood for any five-pinted woozy brains in the afternoon sun. Also, apparently James Acaster was in the pit for Turnstile?! Avalon stage, 6.30pm Am I in purgatory? I have been sent to a field where it is now so packed with people that I can’t move, I’m sleep deprived, there’s a tent in the distance with a stage I can barely see, and all of us are waiting for … McFly. The band take to the stage while YMCA blares, for some reason, and understandably their opening lines when they look out at the crowd are “holy shit!” I’ll be honest: I was a bit too old and annoyingly pretentious for McFly. I liked Busted, which is a rivalry the band jokingly reference today: “If you’re having a good time, we are McFly; if you’re not, we are Busted.” The sound is not really good enough to carry out to the masses who are here, and unlike with Sugababes, who played a similarly packed Avalon, they don’t open with the singalongs in their arsenal. It’s their first time at Glastonbury (“thank you for breaking our virginity!” – I heard them say this, so you have to read it, too), and they’re certainly enjoying it, from what I can see of the lead guitarist zestfully zipping around the stage. The rapturous screaming drifting from the tent suggests the people who have been camping out waiting for the group today are now living their best lives. But by the time they get to Obviously, a girl climbs up one of the tent poles, such are the general enthusiasm levels all over the field. And from then on everyone is clapping, singing along with the “oo-oo-oooh”s and “na-na-naah”s while the band play their one-size-fits-all guitar pop. People are climbing on benches, shrieking when a different member of the group takes to the mic to address them. When they get to Room on the 3rd Floor they laugh: “Billie Eilish was two years old when we wrote this song” – a cute little reminder of our mortality, which really hits hard after they’ve just been singing about being young and wild while my knees hurt simply from walking around at a festival. The biggest, most excitable singalongs come at the end: a cover of Queen’s Don’t Stop Me Now, into All About You – the latter sees people holding each other, harmonising with their eyes closed. And then they leap into the exuberant chaos of their first ever song: Five Colours in Her Hair, which I did not remember having a lyric about wanting to “bone her” – risque! Anyway, it’s no Year 3000, but I’ll grant you that it’s a pretty fun and lovely moment. Caroline Polachek also referenced Roe v Wade decision during her set. “It feels so poignant to be here in the UK when there’s so much policial meltdown back home,” she said. “Access to so much of our healthcare has just been stripped away. And I hope that can serve as a reminder here in Britain to protect the rights that you have, protect the healthcare that you have.” Pyramid, 5.45pm Sandwiched in a Pyramid stage slot between the very different vibes of Diana Ross and Kendrick Lamar on the final night of the festival, it was never guaranteed Manchester indie rock band Elbow would get a truly appreciative audience. But Glastonbury is full of surprises. With a stage backdrop reading “we still believe in love” they announced their arrival with gutsy anthem Dexter and Sinister – and the crowd go remarkably wild. Frontman Guy Garvey paused afterwards to say: “There was a period there where we thought we’d never see you again. We’re so happy to be here, in the place love was invented.” And then, seamlessly, they slipped into ballads Magnificent, Kindling and Empires. There was a reverse Mexican wave, an audience singalong to Lippy Kids, and Garvey had us eating out of the palm of his hand. Briefly, we were back in the room for some of his trademark down-to-earth humour. “I saw a man with a plant pot for a head coming out of the loo. Completely normal.” From there, they were on a home run. The sun began to set as the band blasted out a rocking Grounds for Divorce before bringing out the Citizens of the World choir – made up of refugees – to join them on stage. Garvey has always had the understated charisma of a bloke you’d meet down the pub on a rainy Tuesday who has a fair few tales to tell from a life well lived. His music is at times melancholic, at times uplifting, often comforting, and usually all three. Exactly what this crowd needed, on the final night of a historic weekend, to heal hangovers and soothe the soul. Swaying among tens of thousands to the lyrics “one day like this a year would see me right”, I looked across the enraptured crowd and just thought: too right. Jack White doing Seven Nation Army, meanwhile, sounded like one of the biggest moments at Glastonbury 2022. “Fucking wild!” says Keza. “I thought football matches and drunk people outside my window had ruined that song forever, but no.” Apparently the entire crowd were jumping up and down in perfect unison, which is no mean feat on that sloping hill. Hope everyone’s ankles are fine. Brendan from Turnstile, as buff as a superhero, is seemingly thanking everyone in the front row after their John Peel set. “Thank you for letting me see myself,” he tells them – I just know that this was one of the sets of the weekend, which Gwilym will review for us shortly. The solidarity with Ukraine – such a heartening part of this festival – continues today, chiefly with DakhaBrakha, who wowed the Pyramid stage with some of the weekend’s best outfits. And here’s Macca from last night showing his support. Sorry to be insufferably annoying if you wish you were there, but literally everyone looks like this today: smiling, sunkissed, and smitten with each other. It feels like this Glastonbury has gone faster than ever. I was expecting a kind of feral, mad-eyed energy from people, given they have been waiting for this since they first got tickets in 2019, but the main mood has been a softer mix of relief and bonhomie. “She’s got so many hits she’s forced on occasion to condense them into medleys” – here’s Alexis Petridis’ review of Diana Ross. John Peel stage, 5pm Anyone who says Glastonbury is getting overly gentrified needs to see Amyl and the Sniffers, one of the few bands around today who give off a genuine sense of danger. Frontwoman Amy Taylor’s voice is like a fist through concrete and she has a sublimely ratty, feral stage presence that suggests she lives on nothing but speed and dry cornflakes and knows her way around a headbutt. The modern successor to Iggy Pop, she has a flicky peroxide mullet and wears a tiny gold two-piece that makes her look like Barbarella by way of Abba, and seems, to put it politely, absolutely mashed. Her between-song chat is for the most part magnificently unintelligible: “Anyone seen Bridget Jones’ Diary 3?” she asks at one point, for indiscernible reasons. “She gets knocked up!” She calls 2022 “a sweaty little freak” and also yells “2022! Fuck every cunt!” I’d love to tell you what songs they played but for the most part they all sound like someone rampaging on a piledriver – brute, chugging, primitive, glorious aggression played by a bunch of true hard nutters, some of whom are quite clearly chewing their faces off. From their latest album, 2021’s Comfort to Me, comes Security, which sees Taylor attempt some impromptu ballet in her black knee-high boots; she slaps her own bum during Maggot, a gloriously revolting love song, and looks furious and possessed during Knifey, which ends with her flexing her muscles and roaring in true “come and ‘ave a go if you think you’re hard enough” fashion. Guided By Angels expands the moshpit to take up most of the crowd, and then they play what appears to be a bespoke, boozy sea shanty about Glastonbury. It’s hilarious, deranged, and totally exhilarating. I leave feeling as though I could kick down a wall – as well as heartened by the sight of a six-year-old girl on her dad’s shoulders who was punching her hands in the air the whole way through, observing this superb display of impropriety with wonder. Kacey Musgraves, presumably alluding to the Roe v Wade decision, has told the Other stage: “I’m honestly thinking about never going back to America. Anyone know any positions for sheep farming going? As that sounds really great right now.” Jack White is absolutely blasting through Lazaretto, delivering its rapid-fire lyrics with such verve: “Thrown down to the wolves, made feral for nothing / Quarantined on the Isle of Man / And I’m trying to escape any way that I can”. His guitar tone is just absurdly raunchy, too. Keza is watching Jack White: “The guitars are screaming! The drums are thundering, the bass is rattling ribcages. The Park stage crowd seems somewhat stunned, though that might be because of what they’ve just been through to get here – they’ve had to close the stage because of the mad crowding.” “Glastonbury! It’s Sunday, I’m transcending!” American pop singer-songwriter Caroline Polachek has been around the block – she was half of synthpop duo Chairlift in the 2010s and collabed with Charli XCX and Christine and the Queens on New Shapes (I reckon we might see that later on today at Charli’s set). But this is her first time here. “This festival makes you tenderised but also fortified at the same time,” she says, truly a relatable festival Sunday vibe. She’s a performer with awesome vocal range, which she shows off today on her cover of the Corrs’ Breathless, set to vibrating synth-pop bass. This is a banging moment, though we spend most of the rest of the set somewhat mired in pop ballads about heartbreak (Look at Me Now) and falling in love (Hey Big Eyes). She breaks out a couple of new songs too, such as Sunset, a danceable track with flamenco beats and Spanish guitar. Spinning around the stage giving high femme energy in an artfully tattered grey dress, she’s really enjoying herself. She does eventually bring out the hits: Bunny Is a Rider, an Alice-down-the-rabbit-hole piece of electropop about being desired, and So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings, a yearning sad banger that I’ve heard at every queer karaoke night I’ve been to in the past year. The crowd at the front yells along delightedly. Will we see her again when Charli XCX comes on stage at John Peel? Jack White is the secret guest for the Park stage – a good coup, who feels like a proper star name. With electric blue hair to match his guitar and kecks, he’s shredding his way through a magnificently crunchy opener. After using Erik Satie as their entrance hype music – not one to get the moshpit salivating – frontman Grian Chatten intones: “Gone is the day / gone is the night”. Fontaines DC are clearly going to be the karmic opposite to Diana Ross a few hundred metres away: nihilist and neurotic. The opener In ár gCroíthe Go Deo is both very Glasto – it’s a bit reminiscent of Radiohead – and not at all, a creeping bank of rain on an entirely sunny day. A Lucid Dream follows it, ostensibly boisterous but actually too strange and blustery to pogo to. It initially feels like an anti-audience opening but it sets a restive, itchy tone that builds and builds in power. By Televised Mind, a man is cossack dancing in a circle pit. Nabakov is utterly riveting, its repeated “daze ya, faze ya” chorus line so stoic, trudging and Sisyphean. Too Real is a storm of noise, like My Bloody Valentine with more shape, its guitar line like an accelerating superbike. The weird mood deepens. With his repertoire of odd mannerisms, shaking his hand like it’s got a bit of Sellotape stuck to it, Chatten is hard to tear your eyes from. Dressed in T-shirt and trackie bottoms, he looks like a man who had to sleep on the sofa and is now stalking around the living room in a funk. He is left alone with a string quartet for The Couple Across the Way, and this is one of the most powerful moments I’ve seen at the festival: a melody of staggering simplicity sung over and over, for a song about the loneliness of a lover’s argument. Big Shot is given a new strings and piano arrangement that really suits it, and then it’s back to noise and ranting. I Love You is becoming one of their best loved songs, Chatten’s relentless hectoring finding such a potent rhythm, just as he does on A Hero’s Death, with its vocal harmonies like seeing the Beach Boys through smoked glass. Some of the bands this weekend have been vacuously pleasant, but Fontaines DC are charged with the crackling electricity of life. Ben Beaumont-Thomas here, taking over from Gwilym who is off to lose his trainers and dislocate a finger at Turnstile. Plenty of viewing options on the iPlayer at the mo. Take your pick from Elbow on the Pyramid, Snarky Puppy on the West Holts or the remarkably rowdy Amyl and the Sniffers on the John Peel, where a massive circle pit has just formed. Small children at Glastonbury: it might sound like a recipe for social services, but actually quite a few parents bring their sprogs to the festival, and all parties have a jolly good time too. There’s a great area, Kidzfield, that has magicians, circus performers and Basil actual Brush. Leah Harper has been catching up with parents to find out the pleasures and perils of taking your kids to Glasto: Chris Godfrey has been speaking to Glastonbury’s unsung heroes – stewards, police officers, nurses and more. They’ve offered some top tips on how to enjoy the festival. Short version: stay in the shade, drink loads of water, mainline cereal bars and go with walking boots over wellies. Pyramid ground post-Diana is covered in detritus of sequins, feathers and confetti. We were promised a legends set, and a legends set we got! While there were a few grumbles at Paul McCartney picking a few deep cuts for his Pyramid set last night, you can’t imagine anyone will feel the same here. Ross delivered every last biggie – I’m Coming Out, Upside Down, Baby Love, Ain’t No Mountain High Enough, and of course I’m Coming Out. Yes, her tuning was a little askew at times, but her sheer force of character won the day. I Will Survive is still going, with Ross introducing her impossibly tight backing band and singers. And just like that she floats off into the wings, leaving her band to play the closing notes! “I love how Diana has her own Hollywood star projected on to the stage backdrop,” Sophie Zeldin-O’Neill points out. Top, top diva behaviour. “Do you know this one?” Ross asks, as the opening bars of I Will Survive play. Yes, I believe a few out there may be familiar with it, Diana. Every last person – revellers, stewards, ice cream sellers – sings along. Ain’t No Mountain High Enough! It sounds absolute huge from the Guardian cabin. Ross, now clad in a vast feathery floor-length robe, stomps across the stage commandingly. Ross’s cover of Why Do Fools Fall in Love injects a note of big-band classiness to proceedings. And then the pace slows entirely with the ballad Theme From Mahogany (Do You Know Where You’re Going To). Ross’s voice is a little exposed here, and tuning is an issue again. But we’re not going to talk about that!! Ross’s 1995 track Take Me Higher is next. It’s a mark of how well this set is going down that even the slightly lesser-known tracks are getting everyone dancing. “I’ve just celebrated my birthday,” Ross says. She’s 78 years old, somehow, but is grooving back and forth like it’s 1975 again. And then she casually drops Upside Down. Even the stewards are dancing along! It’s just hit after hit after hit here. Diana leads the crowd in a swoonsome rendition of Still Waiting, cutting the band midway through so it’s just her and them. “We love you so much, you’re so wonderful,” she cries. Avalon stage, 3.20pm PP Arnold has had a storied life. The soulful American singer’s set today is peppered with anecdotes from her past, as when Mick Jagger took her for a walk – “Oh yes he did”; or when she came to London in 1966 as an Ikette – a backing singer for Ike and Tina Turner – and experienced gigging in non-segregated venues for the first time; or when she couldn’t release a song because of “a lot of bloody politics!” These are each followed by her striking, knowing laugh. She looks so pleased to be here, shimmying her puffed sleeve shoulders and smiling to herself. She repeatedly talks about how good it is to be at Glastonbury (“the city of happening, happening music”) after the last few years, and though some of the songs are a bit corny (as per the trills of more recent track, Baby Blue, off her 2019 album The New Adventures of PP Arnold, which she mentions a lot and implores people to buy), she has such enthusiastic energy it’s hard not to be won over. She does several covers, including the Monkees and a particularly pleasant rendition of the Beach Boys’ God Only Knows, and drops in the names of some of the illustrious people who have written or produced songs for her, including Small Faces, Paul Weller and Cat Stevens. There are apparently some sound issues from her perspective, which she explains are because they didn’t get a chance to rehearse all together, but in the crowd, at least, things sound fine. Her voice on the elating classic Angel of the Morning is perfection, pouring out like honey, and The First Cut Is the Deepest, with its twinkly keys, is a sweet way to end proceedings. But it’s not before she gets in a final bit of self-promo, with a cackle and a nod to her autobiography which lands this summer apparently – “I got a whole lotta stories to tell!”, she yells. We’re into the ‘new tracks that audience members are politely smiling to’ portion of the set. Diana’s just played Tomorrow, a very lively funk number, and is following it up with Just Dance, with it’s refrain of “It’s so much better if the world just danced”. Amen to that. Styling a chainmail hood and neon orange guitar for summer, Welsh indie hero Cate Le Bon and her band treat the Park stage to a dreamy, summery set this afternoon, all floaty guitar, languorous piano chords and woozy sax emanating over the sunlit uplands of Glastonbury festival. There is something otherworldly about her as she gazes out at us with a detached, regal expression, like she’s thinking higher thoughts at all times while delivering her coolly professional guitar lines (or perhaps wondering whether she’s left the hob on). Things get a bit more lively during the extended instrumentals of Home to You, which Cate and the band clearly have fun with, and funky bop Harbour has everyone swaying appreciatively. But we are here to soak in a bath of beautiful folky indie rock that soothes the soul, rather than jump and sing along. A truly lovely set. Thank You doesn’t sound like too much of a departure by the way – it’s a lovely, celebratory soul bop, that the crowd are waving along to. Diana is talking about her new album Thank You, which she’s about to play the title track of. “I’m not perfect at it yet, but I will be,” she jokes. I catch the tail end of Declan McKenna, who is in a pair of Elton-worthy wacky glasses, and whose Be an Astronaut very much also channels Elton: big piano chords with a mix of melancholy and stargazing wonder. There’s a long pealing solo from his guitarist – such guitar hero showboating being a repeat part of this festival – and then it’s into Brazil, whose chillwave jangle is ideal Glasto sunshine fodder. He closes with British Bombs, and the ska rhythm has a huge portion of the audience bouncing. Like George Ezra and Blossoms earlier in the weekend, McKenna is a very classic kind of showman with roots in 1970s family-friendly pop. So while his audience may still be pretty young, there’ll be a lot of older converts today. I’m going to broach this very delicately given she’s a legend and all, but Diana sounds a tiny bit off-key. But it doesn’t really matter in this context – she’s still hitting it out of the park. We’ve just had You Can’t Hurry Love and Chain Reaction, bangers both. Yes, she is going to just play wall-to-wall classics! Stop in the Name of Love next. Ross has abandoned her purple shawl and is now glittering away like a diamond. Baby Love! Ross is sashaying around the stage, imperiously. Everyone else is singing along at top volume. She’s just going to play wall-to-wall classics, isn’t she? Another Ross staple up next, her brassy, bouncy cover of Spiral Staircase’s More Today Than Yesterday. Then it’s into her own back catalogue with a swooning rendition of the Supremes classic My World is Empty Without You. The crowd looks vast, bordering on Macca levels. Ross’s backing band are on first, building the anticipation. And here she is, clad in an extraordinary glittery number with a billowing purple shawl on top and feathery headdress. She immediately launches into I’m Coming Out, and has the audience in the palm of her hand already! Any second now Diana Ross will be taking to the stage. I’ll keep you updated on what she’s up to, before a review from Alexis Petridis later on. In the last 30 minutes this liveblog has featured both a lengthy digression on Kenneth Clark’s Civilisation and the phrase “sun’s out, bums out”. Truly all of life’s rich tapestry can be seen here Lonely Hearts Club, 2.45pm Sun’s out, bums out for one of the most exciting artists to come out of South Africa: Moonchild Sanelly, with her distinctive blue mop hairstyle and, today, a corset and harness barely covering her modesty. She is one of the breakout stars from SA’s pop scene, having appeared on Beyoncé’s Lion King soundtrack and now signed to UK indie label Transgressive, on which she has just released new album Phases. She mixes up attitudinal, deep electro-house and relentless bouncing bass with the sound of the Jo’burg club scene, such as gqom from Durban – with its shadowy, punchy instrumentals and relentlessly stabby vocal samples – and the slow groove of Kwaito. Then add the military drums and rapping reminiscent of other globetrotting innovators such as MIA and Santigold. Sanelly’s USP is female empowerment and body positivity and her songs have easy-catchy slogans that have rippled through TikTok: songs about being cute, wanting to smooch or generally being a boss lady. It’s a high energy set that’s exactly what’s needed for Sunday afternoon – on the excellently programmed Lonely Hearts Club stage – and is joined by two dancers and a DJ for some raunchy choreography. Truth be told, it makes the Downlow look a bit tame. She has the bangers to match. To UK ears they might sound underground but this is mega-pop on her home turf. There’s her mega tune Thunda Thighs, a deeply bassy, seriously excellent cellulite-wobbler that might single-handedly bring twerking back. Her Bey collab My Power still sounds like little else out there at the moment. And then there’s a brilliant moment when Sanelly comes into the crowd and challenges various onlookers to a dance-off. That communal experience and audience interaction is what Glasto is all about. John Peel tent, 2pm The John Peel tent, and surrounding field, are as stuffed for George Ezra’s secret set as they were for the Killers a few years ago. There’s the worry, with someone who has such beloved singles, that it might be another Glass Animals situation (as we are officially calling it now), with the audience only there for the whopping hits. But that isn’t the case at all: they roar with feral delight at every song and know every single word. Although some might balk at the concept, Ezra makes platonic-ideal festival music, about sunshine and joy and holidays. Beach balls abound above the crowd’s heads. And particularly in keeping with Glastonbury is his palpably sincere faith in people. On a fragile Sunday lunchtime, it’s almost enough to reduce you to a weeping puddle. “We’re alright together!” he sings on Pretty Shining People, eyes shut, pressing a palm to his chest, smiling dreamily in double denim, and you believe him. Curiously, the set barely draws from his great new album, Gold Rush Kid, other than a particularly dialled up, rabid version of Green Green Grass. Ezra makes no bones about being a crowdpleasing artist, and he gives the people what they want. That said, you can slightly feel the limitations of some of his older, brassier, stompier stuff from his debut album Wanted on Voyage compared to the newer material, which is more complex and idiosyncratically delightful. Mid-set, we dig into what Ezra calls a “Sunday mood”, keeping things mellow. His band sound rich and lovelorn – so much so that you could imagine Ezra making a great Nashville record some day. Then he starts to bring out the big guns: live, you realise what a tremendous sense of anticipation is built into Paradise and how the song cleverly encapsulates both the feeling of pleasure and of craving it. It climaxes in a chorus that he almost yells, battering his guitar, and the keys and brass swirl in a lovely cascade of sound that evokes the dazzle of arcade game lights. Of course, it ends with the irresistible Shotgun, Ezra singing the whoops in the verses with a real charming sense of silliness. It’s a song about being someone’s copilot for pleasure, and it’s hard to think of anyone you’d want in the front seat more than Ezra with his radiant commitment to fun. All weekend Guardian chief culture writer and Glasto novice Charlotte Higgins has been sampling the delights of the festival, experiencing late-night raves, mojitos, burritos and something called laughter yoga. She’s written up her experiences for a rather lovely piece, where she ponders the meaning of the festival: Wandering back to the campsite, one of my friends asks: “What would Kenneth Clark have made of it? Would he have thought this was civilisation?” It’s a good question. Glastonbury is either a highly advanced form of civilisation, or the opposite – a form of anticivilisation. The food, the toilet stench, the rubbish that piles up underfoot, the bodies, the sweat, the desire, the intoxication: everything that is raw and human is visible, on the surface, not buried or tidied away, as in normal life. Glastonbury: it’s not just heritage rock acts and Palaeolithic ravers. There’s young people here too, if you look hard enough. Elle Hunt went on the hunt for the elusive Gen-Z, and asked them for their thoughts on the festival, Macca, fashion and more: SPOTTED: (by our indefatigable roving reporter Sophie Zeldin-O’Neill) Just walked past Cockney comic legend Mickey Flanagan. Going out out! Park stage, 2pm Warmduscher entertained the Park stage this afternoon with scuzzy, dancey disco punk rock straight out of a London dive bar. It is impossible to hear much of singer Clams Baker Jr’s distorted, drawling vocals, but thankfully Little Whiskers’ filthy guitar and wild drumming from Quicksand come through loud and clear (gotta love this band’s collection of brilliant rock aliases). This is some enthusiastic dancing for 2pm on Sunday: Midnight Dipper is the track that gets people bouncing, with its irresistible riff. The band look admirably clean in matching spotless white jumpsuits but the music is dirty as heck, just as it should be. Hi all, Gwilym here, walking you through the next three hours of Glastonbury. It’s T-minus one hour until Diana Ross takes to the Pyramid for the Glasto legends slot. We’ve got tons more coming, too: Fontaines DC, Amyl and the Sniffers, Caroline Polachek and ... McFly! West Holts, 12.30pm Emma-Jean Thackray’s vision of jazz is cosmic and kooky, a wash of gold-tinted horns, murmuring sub-bass and rich, languid melody. Clearly taking inspiration from spiritual jazz icons such as Alice Coltrane and McCoy Tyner but also referencing UKG, northern English brass band culture and neo-soul, she’s the perfect musician to help wash away two days’ worth of debasement and debauchery. Taking to the West Holts stage at 12.30pm, Thackray and her band are dressed in outfits that might best be described as “jazz chav” – Thackray herself wears a burnt orange anorak and an Adidas bucket hat, and her band are clad in hoodies, sweatbands and sneakers. Launching into a run of cuts from Thackray’s recent album Yellow, they’re in fine form, Thackray herself deftly switching between trumpet, vocals and sequencer throughout the set. As the band launches into Venus – drawn out, here, into a winding 10-minute jam – Thackray explains her process: “I’m a bit of a hippie,” she tells the audience. Half of the crowd is dancing madly, and the other half is prostrate, totally blissed out. “I write about the cosmos, the planets, what it all means …” The entire set is an odyssey: although it starts slow, Thackray is an adept bandleader and a sublime master of ceremonies; by the time she hits Yellow, a twinkling, Four Tet-ish jam, she’s pulled a dusty early afternoon crowd out of their hangovers and into her surreal, spacey zone. Some pics from George Ezra’s secret set, currently enchanting the John Peel stage. If you’re getting Glasto fomo, feel free to massively ramp it up with this new hymn to the festival by the Waterboys, who played the Acoustic stage last night and by all accounts were very good. Laura is in a packed tent for the day’s first secret set, George Ezra. She says: Unlike Glass Animals, certified hitmaker Ezra doesn’t have the problem that people have only turned up to hear his biggest singles – the crowd is word-perfect for every song, back to his brassy debut, and so far he’s keeping us waiting for the biggest of his big guns: Shotgun, Paradise. (I’m hoping he does I Went Hunting, my favourite song from his new album.) John Peel stage, 12.30pm A surprisingly sizeable crowd has dragged itself out of bed and over to the John Peel for this lunchtime set, lured by Sports Team’s tales of motorways and middle England. Perhaps by Glastonbury Sunday everyone is homesick for suburban mundanity – though it helps that Sports Team have the indie disco tunes for days to go along with the ennui: Long Hot Summer is like a recently unearthed 80s Cure singalong, while Going Soft’s sudden chord changes and shoutalong chorus is reminiscent of Modern Life Is Rubbish-era Blur. With his eye for absurdist detail and laconic delivery, frontman Alex Rice is often compared to Jarvis Cocker or Damon Albarn, but there’s something looser and more slackerish about their sound. That, though, masks some pretty tight musicianship – they tear through early single Kutcher with the confidence of a band who know their worth. They still find time for a spot of needling of their peers, a recurrent theme of their career to date, with digs in interviews at the likes of Shame and HMLTD: here, it takes the form of Camel Crew, a withering put down of the cliquey south London art-rock scene they were never quite part of (“This avant garde is still the same / Go to Goldsmiths and they dye their fringes / Just to know they’ve made it only / When they sign the rights to Sony”). You wonder how long they’ll need to carry on with this scene squabbling – on the evidence here, Sports Team will soon have bigger battles to wage. Our photographer Antonio Olmos has been wandering the fields and documenting the impressive array of eccentricity and expression that this festival brings out in people. Park stage, 12.45pm Big Joanie are one of the coolest, punkest bands in the world. As soon as the UK Black feminist trio take to the Park stage they hit us with a dissonant wall of sound, big smiles and unfaltering, formidable vocals. Between songs they talk about the state of the world, discussing everything from the British government’s attempts to send refugees to Rwanda, Roe v Wade (“it feels like everything is going backward but we can’t let them win”), transphobia, why we should be buying striking RMT workers cups of tea on the picket line (“a win for them is a win for us”). They describe how their song Crooked Room is inspired by Black feminist academic Melissa Harris-Perry, who described the world as a crooked room built to exclude so many of us – the job of their band, they say, is to break out of the room. It’s a theme that runs through the set– ahead of In My Arms they say: “We stand in solidarity with you, we hope you stand in solidarity with us.” This collective mindset is clear in the way they play, too – every time I’ve seen the band they perform as close as is possible to being in a line, each of them given equal prominence and equal voice on stage. They perform as if in communion, taut and vibrantly in sync with one another; this is especially notable on their always exquisite cover of Solange’s Cranes in the Sky, transformed here into a snarling thudding march. It’s telling that the talk of solidarity and action isn’t po-faced, and there’s humour and laughter and warmth throughout the show. “This song is about men being shit in bed,” vocalist and guitarist Steph Phillips grins, before drummer and vocalist Chardine Taylor-Stone adds: “It doesn’t have to be this way, I’m sure there’s some kind of workshop you can attend in Shangri-La.” It’s You is a playful song full of yelps and chants and thumping beats. They get cut off at the end as their set has run slightly over, but the skies are blue, the sun is shining down on the Park, and they leave the stage emanating a powerful, radical feeling of hope. The reviews of Macca are in from both heart-eyed critics and swooning audience members – our news team has rounded up the reaction here. A special mention to these glorious images by our photographer David Levene of Róisín Murphy, which have a kind of Philip Marlowe noir aspect to them even though it was actually a super fun set of liquid-hips disco. A look back at some tip-top sets from yesterday. Ben Beaumont-Thomas here, taking over while Laura goes to watch her floppy-haired king. Good morning only to the DJ at the Maceo’s bar who played You’re Makin’ Me High by Toni Braxton last night and fulfilled every level of my needs pyramid. Spirits are mostly high around the Guardian cabin this morning, though the conspicuous sight of almost everyone eating a large salad suggests there might be some atoning going on for last night’s indulgences. Personally I feel as though I have cheated death and will be off to celebrate with my beloved George Ezra imminently. I don’t know exactly how I became a huge George Ezra fan, it just crept up on me. I interviewed him for the Observer earlier this year and he was exactly as nice as you would expect. Glasto being Glasto – the size, the scale, the weather – sometimes things don’t go to plan and so our live Q&amp;A with Angélique Kidjo on Sunday didn’t go ahead, unfortunately. But we managed to catch her backstage ... Benin-born Kidjo is one of the African continent’s most recognisable artists, whose fusion of myriad African musical styles and traditions with contemporary western pop, Latin jazz and beyond laid the groundwork not only for today’s Afro-pop explosion but also for how forward-thinking, experimental and truly global a pop musician can be. She’s released more than 18 albums, worked with the likes of Alicia Keys, Philip Glass, Peter Gabriel and Herbie Hancock, has released an album of Talking Heads covers and a tribute to salsa legend Celia Cruz. Her 2021 album Mother Nature featured some of the biggest next-gen African stars, such as Yemi Alade, Mr Eazi, Burna Boy and Sampa the Great, the latter two who have also performed across the weekend. This is Kidjo’s first Glastonbury. Hi Angelique, how are you finding the festival so far? It’s a huge village of people. I can’t wait to be on stage and see all those people dancing. It’s about time that festivals opened their eyes to African talent. We have to stop being arrogant, deciding who has the right to perform here or there. We all have the right to exist. There’s a far greater number of African artists playing this year, from Burna Boy to Tems. How is this new wave and your own music changing perceptions? I think the youth are starting the revolution in music. They want change, profound change, in every way – political, economic. When you first heard Afrobeats [the umbrella term for the pop sound that blends highlife, juju, R&amp;B and hip-hop] stars like Wizkid and Tiwa Savage from Nigeria, what did you think of their music and this new sound that was coming through? I predicted this would happen. The thing that gets me is the fact that all of them have been inspired by my music. And for me to hear my music played by this new generation means that I have had an impact that I didn’t even know. What is really interesting to me is to see that finally what I have been dreaming of doing when I was there is coming to life. The technology allowed them to be artists in their own right, without counting on anybody, especially not the westerner, to dictate what they have to do. Me, I had to flee my country [to Paris in the 1980s] because of communist dictatorship and I didn’t have the technology that exists today. These African artists today can have their own career, unapologetically, not having to answer to anyone. Does it feel like we’ve come a long way since the era of calling non-western music “world music”? I hate that word. I’ve always hated that word. Rock’n’roll came from Africa. The people decided to call us one music, that’s based on ignorance. It’s a different kind of slavery, a musical slavery. And I’ve always been outside that because I’ve always done what I wanted to do. My music is not to please the critics, it’s to please the public. Do you ever get annoyed when you hear people sampling African music and putting in their music because it’s “cool” now? People that take samples that don’t give credit, they live with themselves. But music is not appropriation, it’s expansion. If we don’t we don’t tap into each other’s music, music is gonna shrink and disappear. Today our music is in hip-hop, it’s everywhere. My view is: take it, give it credit, and support it to be global. When you left Benin for Paris, did the European music industry ever try to put you in a box? I don’t fit in anybody’s box. I grew up in a family where my mum and dad, they brought me all kinds of music from all walks of life. I listen to every music that is in the world. But for the first photo shoot for my first album [on Island Records, 1991’s Logozo], the stylist said they didn’t know what to dress me in because “people where you’re from, you walk around naked, right?” So I said let me get my own wardrobe. I’m a modern African lady. I’m gonna show you how modern Africa can get. And so you picked out an amazing zebra catsuit! Did you ever feel too ahead of your time? Yeah, and you pay a huge price for it! When I did my first album in Benin in 1981, the biggest promoter in west Africa was supposed to launch my career and do my first show outside of my country. Two weeks before that concert, he came to my father and said: “I don’t want to invest in your daughter. She’s too little. Nobody gonna see her on stage.” And my father retired from the Post Office, we have very little money, he said: “I’m gonna make a point to show this guy that is stupid.” You got talent or you don’t got talent. My father said, we don’t mind drinking tea, for lunch, breakfast, dinner, whatever it’s takes [to afford to this]. So my father put his money [into it] and we got the poster back, changed the date, found new musicians, and I played the show. My father showed me that is possible in the face of adversity to tap into your own resources, tap into your resilience and move forward. Live with purpose. Nothing is impossible. You must have loads of great other life advice, Angélique … The most important lesson I’ve learned is from my maternal grandmother. I was 12, coming back from high school and out of nowhere, from the back, I was hit by stones and sand, with people chanting “prostitute” because I was a singer. I didn’t want to sing anymore if I have to be called prostitute. And my grandmother said: “Understand this. You cannot please everybody. And it goes both ways.” As long as what you are doing empowers your life and it doesn’t hurt you or nobody, do it. And here’s Dorian Lynskey’s roundup of the festival for today’s Observer. Our news team have been busy bees this weekend: here’s one of their many reports, on how the cost of living crisis is affecting the Glastonbury economy. I have to admit, while it’s nice to have a grounding spell manning the live blog, I am devastated to be missing Pam Ayres on the Cabaret stage. I love Pam. Just look at this amazing clip of her talking about Easter. I went to see her live at Stevenage Leisure Centre a few years ago and I think if you multiplied my age by three I would still have been the youngest person there. What a legend. Diana Ross is on in the legends slot later today, so Kate Hutchinson has been out quizzing the people on what makes her an icon. Dream Nails: Mimi, 31, Lucy, 30, Leah, 28, Anya, 34 Leah: The roots of Diana Ross and queerness and campery and being part of that community ... it’s not just icon status, it’s like going to church for the queers. Lucy: Upside Down has genuinely been the screensaver of my brain – it’s been stuck in my head since childhood. “There’s certainly a degree of bullishness about McCartney’s second Glastonbury headlining performance, which draws an immense Saturday night crowd,” our pop critic Alexis Petridis wrote of Paul McCartney’s headline set last night, in which he brought out Bruce Springsteen and Dave Grohl. Read the full thing here! Good morning from the Guardian’s cabin, where it’s definitely a two cans of Coke morning. The secret sets today have been announced – it’s George Ezra on the John Peel tent, and Jack White up at the Park stage, which will surely be rammed so I’d get there early if I were you. The sun’s out for Diana Ross in the legends slot, and also later today is the superb Herbie Hancock.

This surge, which saw 100MW of capacity in 1992 rocket to more than 300GW in 2016, has been largely driven by falling costs, which plunged 86% between 2009 and 2017. China, the world leader in building and installing solar panels, added a record-breaking amount of capacity last year. The technology is even setting records in the grey UK: at one point last summer even providing more power than the nation’s nuclear power stations. But with some experts asking whether the cost reduction curve of solar is drawing to an end, there are questions over whether stratospheric growth can be maintained. And while more energy from the sun hits the Earth’s surface in an hour than humanity uses each year, can today’s silicon-based solar meet our long-term power needs? To meet these challenges, researchers around the world are racing to explore new materials which can eke out more energy from the sun’s photons and be used more flexibly than today’s panels. The most abundant mineral on Earth has become the frontrunner, promising more efficient and lighter solar panels, which could even be made semi-transparent for use as windows. “Perovskite currently has taken the lead among emerging photovoltaic (PV) technologies,” says Varun Sivaram, fellow for science and technology at the Council on Foreign Relations. His upcoming book on solar says the crystal has made a meteoric ascent in academic circles, describing it as: “a material that could enable manufacture of cheap, highly efficient solar coatings that could be unspooled from a printer much as newspaper is printed.” One firm born in Oxford, England, is at the vanguard of the race to develop and scale up perovskite for commercial use. Founded in 2010, Oxford PV initially spent years exploring an alternative, dye-sensitive cells. But Henry Snaith, the firm’s co-founder, changed tack in 2012. “I discovered perovskite could be extremely efficient in PV cells. We realised this was where the real opportunity lay.” The British- and German-based company’s big idea is to piggyback on the success of silicon, which Chinese manufacturing scale and efficiency has made so cheap. Perovskite captures energy from a different part of sunlight’s wavelength than silicon, so Oxford PV’s plan is to layer it atop silicon, to maximise electricity generation. “We find ourselves in a position that we are not fighting a $35bn industry [silicon], we are enhancing it. The idea is use the existing assets. If you do something completely different it will fail. This can complement the existing cell,” said Frank Averdung, the company’s CEO. Working with a major but unnamed solar panel manufacturer, the firm hopes to have a product ready for market by 2019. While the price of silicon-based solar panels has fallen from more than $350 per megawatt hour for a largescale farm in 2009 to more than $50 in 2017, some in the sector think such dramatic reductions have come to an end. Artur Kupczunas, co-founder of Poland-based perovskite firm Saule Technologies, said the cost cuts had bottomed out: “We saw a very rapid fall of the prices. [But] there are technology obstacles [for it] to go down as rapidly as it did since 2013.” Saule, which is in talks with Japan’s space agency, is developing inkjet printing for its perovksite-based solar modules. Today it can only print them at A4 size, but the company’s 25-strong team hopes to expand that to one square metre by the year’s end. Kupczunas is most excited about the prospect of incorporating the solar panels in fabric of new buildings, both in the walls and - because it can be made semi-transparent - as windows. “You can use it in the whole building,” he said, noting silicon was too heavy for such applications. Perovskite is what as known as a third generation solar cell. Silicon is first generation, while a group of other rivals including thin film are the second. Compared to silicon, which needs to heated at more than 1,000C during manufacture for solar cells, perovskite does not need to be processed at high temperatures. That means it is less energy-intensive and is less costly to make. A typical silicon-based solar cell converts around 21-22% of sunlight into energy, and the material’s limit is 29%. Oxford PV thinks that its approach of perovskite-on-silicon can get that efficiency up to around 25%. “What it means is out of same cell, you get 20% more power. That is significant,” said Averdung. Paul Coxon, a physicist in materials science at Cambridge University, thinks that combining silicon and perovskite could be a good way to commercialise the new technology and overcome the limits of the older one. “No matter how cheap they [silicon-based cells] become that limit [of 29% efficiency] will still apply. As humanity’s need for electricity grows, continuing with this single technology this limit might pose a tricky hurdle to overcome,” he said. Coxon said the potential for perovskite is huge, and research is growing fast, as evidenced by nearly 4,000 scientific papers being published on it last year alone. However, he expects silicon will continue to dominate in large, utility-scale solar farms, with the new technology used in smaller, constrained spaces. “I think we may see perovskite cells used in solar tiles in domestic and smaller scales and maybe even in space-based PV arrays,” he said. Some might question the need for more efficient solar cells, when China has made silicon-based ones so cheap. But experts believe there are still good reasons to ramp up efficiency through materials like perovskite. Michael McGehee, professor of materials science at Stanford University, said: “As the cost of solar panels has come down over the last 10 years, the situation has arisen where a little more than half of the cost of putting in a collection of panels is the installation itself. “For that reason, it is highly desirable to improve the efficiency of the panels so that the number of panels that needs to be installed is reduced. Indirectly that lowers the installation costs. That is why continuing to improve the efficiency is still very important.” Of course, there is no guarantee perovskite will succeed as solar’s new wonder material. Academics and companies repeatedly emphasised to the Guardian that development is at very early stages, and Oxford PV and Saule both have technical and production challenges to overcome. Other third generation materials are competing too. “Although perovskite is the lab leader, it does have potential drawbacks, and it isn’t the only promising solar material out there. Other approaches - including organic and quantum dot solar cells - come with their own unique advantages,” said Sivaram. But the biggest obstacles are likely to be financial ones, such as skittish investors who were burned by previous boom-and-bust cycles in clean technology. Sivaram said: “As long as investors and the solar industry continue to ignore academia, perovskite and other new solar technologies could well remain lab-bench novelties.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Increasingly, the answer is yes. She recently spoke to a woman who had a $35,000 personal loan on a high interest rate to a bank, when her car broke down. The woman said she had no choice but to use Afterpay to get $1,000 to fix it. “Often people don’t even mention those contracts,” Tacon says. “They call because they can’t afford to pay their rent, or they call because they’ve got this massive energy bill. “When you dig a bit deeper and you wonder where the money is going, more and more people mention, almost as an afterthought, an Afterpay, a Zip [Money], Latitude.” The lure of buy now, pay later, or BNPL, products has turned consumers away from their credit cards in ever-increasing number and made millionaires of investors who have backed companies such as Afterpay and Zip Money. The pitch is simple: instead of paying cash or putting it on the plastic, use an app to put down an instalment today, walk away with your new shoes, iPhone or power tool and pay off the rest later. It’s the opposite of a layby scheme. From nothing, the sector has exploded. The value of transactions through market leader Afterpay doubled last year, from $5.2bn to $11.1bn. The companies say their product is cheaper for consumers to use than a credit card, and point to a new code to counter claims that the industry is too loosely regulated. The enforceable code, developed by the industry and in force from 1 March, is intended to protect consumers by providing standards about the suitability of the product, the information it provides and how complaints are handled. But consumer groups say BNPL products, which have escaped regulation as loans, are just another way people can get themselves into too much debt. They want the products subjected to the same laws as other credit. The chief executive of the Consumer Action Law Centre, Gerard Brody, says his financial counsellors and lawyers are increasingly being contacted by people who have accumulated significant debt on buy now, pay later platforms. It is common, he says, for people to prioritise these repayments over other essential items because of fears they will be kicked off the app. “It’s just another type of debt on top of credit card debt, utility debt, rental arrears. “The very light regulatory framework around buy now, pay later, it risks these being accessed for purposes that aren’t suitable for the borrower. “Even payday lenders are required to assess whether the loans are not only affordable but that the loan’s purpose meets the purchaser’s needs.” Brody is increasingly concerned by the range of products which can be purchased on the platforms, from healthcare to alcohol and solar power systems, which had been spruiked by door-to-door salesmen. He says larger retailers who have partnered with the platforms should consider whether they are harming their customers. “The big retailers could play a role in ensuring the buy now, pay later products are safe and regulated. “They have responsibilities to their customers as well. “I wouldn’t think the big retailers would like to see their customers in financial hardship because of a credit product they’re offering at point of sale, so I would like the big retailers to take a more proactive role.” One person who sought assistance through the law centre, Adelaide teacher Rachel Black, says she had acquired significant debt through payday lending, and occasionally turned to Zip Money to afford groceries. She was troubled by the ease of registering for the platforms, and says she knows other families in Adelaide’s northern suburbs that are similarly reliant on them to buy essentials. Tacon says the call from the woman about her broken-down car was the second that week that illustrated the allure and possible dangers of BNPL. She had also heard from a woman who was able to use up to $4,000 with a BNPL provider, despite having fallen behind on a $1,000 contract with another provider, which was incurring late fees. The client, a psychiatric nurse, had seen her income fall as Covid-19 restrictions affected the number of shifts she could do. “It’s never the only problem they have,” Tacon says. “So many people we speak to have every cent of their money, paycheck to paycheck, accounted for. The road to regulation The UK government announced earlier this month that it would be regulating the sector, putting in “the same protections you’d expect with other loans” according to John Glen, the economic secretary to the Treasury. “We’re making sure people are treated fairly and only offered agreements they can afford,” Glen said. The Australian regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, is actively monitoring the sector and has raised concerns about the dangers of consumers running up big bills. According to Asic research, the industry reaped more than $43m for missed payments in 2019, up 38% on the previous year, and some consumers were in financial hardship – including some who cut back on buying food – as a result of using BNPL schemes. The number of BNPL accounts in Australia soared from less than half a million in 2016 to 3.7m in 2019, Asic said. However, Asic lacks the power to take similar regulatory action to its UK counterpart. Asic regulates consumer lending under the National Credit Code, but BNPL products fall outside its remit due to a quirk in the law that requires a fee to be charged to consumers for their credit for it to qualify as a loan. Because BNPL fees – which can be around 4% of the face value – are paid by merchants, they are not regulated as loans. This leaves the public protected only by general consumer law against things such as misleading or deceptive conduct. Not surprisingly, the BNPL platforms don’t think they need to be regulated any more than they are. Afterpay’s head of public policy, Damian Kassabgi, points to the company’s cap on fees and its policy of throwing people off the platform as soon as they default. “If anything, I think what Afterpay has done is lifted standards, from the National Credit Code,” he says. Zip Money co-founder Peter Gray says the company has a lower proportion of people falling behind on their payments than credit cards. “We have rigorous onboarding checks which involve ID, credit and affordability checks, and less than one in 100 Zip customers is late in any given month,” he says. “Certainly the hardship number is significantly less than that.” He says the product needs “appropriate” regulation. “There are a few carve-outs in the current legislation for payday loans and credit cards, so what we’re suggesting is that an appropriate carve-out of that regulation fit for purpose for our industry would be appropriate.” With Asic in internal turmoil and under attack from the government for being too forward with policy suggestions, the regulator is unlikely to lobby for stronger regulation any time soon. But the sector will this year face a potential regulatory challenge from the Reserve Bank, which regulates the payments system. It has raised concerns over BNPL companies banning merchants from passing on fees they charge to use the service. The RBA has previously banned credit card operators, including Visa and Mastercard, from doing the same. In a speech in December, governor Philip Lowe said that despite BNPL’s ferocious growth, it was still far too small to regulate in the same way. But the issue is being re-examined as part of an RBA review of the retail payments system that is due to report back in the middle of the year. If no-surcharge rules were banned, BNPL fees could be added to the price of goods, potentially deterring users. BNPL providers might instead cut their fees, but either course would make turning a profit even harder. Afterpay’s Kassabgi says that at around 1% of payments, BNPL products are a long way south of the point where the bank stepped in to regulate credit card fees. “The RBA didn’t regulate cards until they were about 60% market share, so they were very embedded into the economy before there was intervention,” he says. Zip Money’s Gray rejects the idea point blank. “We should not be regulated under the schemes regulation of the RBA, and we’re sufficiently regulated as is,” he says. Following the fraud Left unsaid in the UK government statement about regulating the sector was an increasing fear the platforms could be used to commit crime, as occurred with the introduction of other financial products such as smart ATMs and touch-and-go or paywave technology. IDCare, a not-for-profit consumer support organisation, received 1,600 incident reports alleging fraud or identity theft using BNPL products in Australia last year, double the number of the year before. BNPL was used much more often than credit cards in reported frauds of amounts less than $5,000. There have been few serious crimes linked to BNPL in Australia. But larger retailers have been targeted by people who buy goods with a high resale value, such as power tools, using the platforms. While the platform provider guarantees each sale and pays the merchant upfront, if the platform operator then detects a possible crime, it will contact the police, who may then contact the merchant as part of their investigation. Kassabgi says Afterpay has sophisticated systems in place to stop fraud. “Some days between 30% to 50% of transactions are rejected because we believe there has been some kind of fraudulent activity,” he says. “Purchasing something like an iPhone has a high risk rating because it’s the kind of thing that you could sell. If you want to purchase a pink pair of size 11 shoes that have open toes, that’s a relatively niche purchase.” Such problems have not worried investors. Over the past year, the share price of Afterpay has more than tripled from about $40 to more than $150 while stock in Zip Money has doubled from about $4.30 to almost $8.70. The spectacular gains have been realised even though both companies are losing money. Zip reported a $453.8m loss in the six months to December, on revenue that increased 130% to $160m. Afterpay is due to report its half-year figures on Friday. But investors believe both are capable of achieving the kind of scale that will make big profits flow in the future. Afterpay’s head of investor relations, Marie Festa, says the company’s fast growth and high margins on transactions in Australia gives it a model to scale up and make money around the world. “We are still a very young company that is really investing in growth and expansion,” she says. Zip’s Gray also points to the company’s growth. “External people evaluate the level of engagement that we have with consumers and the way we’re able to scale, our very low operational costs, so there’s significant value in the business,” he says. However, it’s not a universally held view. Analyst Grant Halverson says the valuations slapped on the sector by the market are overblown given their businesses are still small compared with credit cards, the potential for stronger regulation as they get bigger and the narrow margins they enjoy. “What happens on the share market is not necessarily what happens in the real world,” he says, comparing the situation with the early 2000s dotcom bubble. “The great thing about the stock market is that it’s right,” he says. “Until it’s wrong.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/may/24/britains-largest-solar-farm-poised-to-begin-development-in-kent","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-24T10:04:14Z","webTitle":"Britain's largest solar farm poised to begin development in Kent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/24/britains-largest-solar-farm-poised-to-begin-development-in-kent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/may/24/britains-largest-solar-farm-poised-to-begin-development-in-kent","fields":{"headline":"Britain's largest solar farm poised to begin development in Kent","bodyText":"Britain’s largest solar farm, capable of generating enough clean electricity to power 91,000 homes, is poised to receive the greenlight from ministers this week. The subsidy-free renewables park is expected to reach a capacity of 350MW by installing 880,000 solar panels – some as tall as buses – across 364 hectares (900 acres) of farmland in the Kent countryside. The project is expected to be constructed one mile north-east of Faversham close to the village of Graveney and may also include one of the largest energy storage installations in the world. The developers expect to receive a development consent order for the £450m project from the business secretary, Alok Sharma, on Thursday almost three years after talks began with local stakeholders over plans for the park. Once it has the final g0-ahead from the government the developers hope to begin building the Cleve Hill solar farm from early next year, and begin generating clean electricity by 2023. Renewable energy is considered a crucial element in the UK’s plans to end its contribution to the climate crisis by building a carbon neutral economy by 2050, and it could also help spur economic growth in the wake of the coronavirus. The UK’s growing fleet of solar panels has produced record levels of clean electricity in recent weeks, reaching fresh highs of 9.68GW last month and helping the UK energy system to its longest stretch without coal-fired power since the Industrial Revolution. The renewables industry believes the UK’s solar power capacity could rise to 27GW by 2030 after the UK government dropped a block which prevented solar farms and onshore wind projects from competing in subsidy contract auctions. A boom in battery projects could mean the electricity generated by solar panels during the day could help to keep lights on at night too, helping to cut carbon emissions and domestic energy bills. The development partners behind the scheme, Wirsol Energy and Hive Energy, believe the project could help cut the UK’s carbon emissions by 68,000 tonnes a year while generating £1m of revenue for the Kent and Swale councils every year. But local activists have voiced concerns that the scale of the solar park, which is the equivalent of 600 football fields, could do more harm than good for the local area. Helen Whately, the Conservative MP for Faversham and Mid Kent, said the scale of the development would have a “devastating” impact by “industrialising” the countryside. “We’re not talking about a few fields - this would destroy an entire landscape. I want to see us reach net-zero by 2050, but this should not come at any cost,” she told the Sunday Telegraph earlier this month. The Campaign to Protect Rural England in Kent has also warned that the proposed battery storage facilities are five times the size of some of the largest storage projects in the world, which could raise the risk of explosions and fire. The developers have rebutted claims from its critics that the project has failed to give due consideration to the safety concerns of local residents, or the impact of the local environment. Cleve Hill has put forward plans to preserve native woodland and scrub within the bounds of the site by hosting a habitat management area of more than 138 hectares – including a new bat roost. The planning will include footpaths for ramblers, and a buffer zone of at least 63 metres between the solar park and the Saxon Shore Way. A spokeswoman for the project said the developers had responded to concerns over the scale of the project’s battery storage ambitions “in great detail” during the examination process with the Planning Inspectorate. She added that safety considerations had been discussed “in great length” with the supply chain, the Health and Safety Executive and Kent Fire and Rescue Service. • This article was amended on 26 May 2020. An earlier version said that Cleve Hill solar farm had won the support of the Planning Inspectorate earlier this month. However, the recommendation has not been made public.

The prime minister told reporters on Tuesday he was excited to announce “the thumbs-up, green light for the Snowy 2.0 project to now move to its full implementation phase” with construction to begin over the next two years. “We know we need to get this up and running to meet our timetable for getting this energy into the system, to getting our emissions reduction targets achieved, and ensuring that the jobs that are so necessary now … as we’re building our way out of the Covid recession,” Morrison said at a media conference, where he was introduced by the Liberal candidate for Saturday’s byelection, Fiona Kotvojs. Last month the New South Wales government gave its approval for the 2,000-megawatt pumped hydro storage project in the Snowy Mountains but it still required federal environmental approval before work could start. The federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said on Tuesday she had signed off the final approval and highlighted a commitment by Snowy Hydro to spent $100m on biodiversity and environmental enhancements. These funds would include $73.8m for an offset fund through the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service “to protect threatened species and deliver long-term conservation outcomes”, a government statement said. Ley thanked Snowy Hydro for its work on the environmental impact statement “to make sure that the threatened species, the communities, the precious amenity of Kosciuszko national park will be protected, remediated and even enhanced”. “Remember that the construction footprint for this second stage of this nation-building renewable energy project is just 0.1% of the park,” she said. “The actual final operating area is just 0.01%. So I’m giving a sense of the vastness of Kosciuszko. Yes, it’s an intense activity but we will, in remediating, in enhancing, in looking after the species that are so important to making this park special, invest through Snowy Hydro – they will invest $100m.” Snowy 2.0 was announced by the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in March 2017 as a 50% expansion and transformation of the historic Snowy scheme to include pumped hydro storage that could be called on to provide electricity when required. He said the project would provide some of the “firm” generation needed as more variable wind and solar power was introduced into the national grid. It was expected to cost $2bn, a sum that has since more than doubled. The development has been criticised by some energy specialists, environmental groups and scientists. In March 30 engineers, economists, energy professionals and environmentalists wrote to Morrison to call for a final decision on the development to be delayed to allow an independent review, and said there was evidence it would cost far more and deliver far less than promised. They said it would permanently damage a much larger area of the Kosciuszko national park, that about 40% of the energy would be lost before it reached consumers and it was likely to cost at least $10bn. The director of the Victoria energy policy centre at Victoria University, Bruce Mountain, said there were cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternatives. Mark Lintermans, an associate professor at the University of Canberra, resigned as chair of the NSW threatened fishes committee after the project won state government approval in May. Lintermans said he would not serve an administration that had “wilfully ignored” the development’s impact on species including the critically endangered stocky galaxias, which he said was likely to be driven to extinction in the wild. The National Parks Association of NSW described the project as “environmental vandalism”. Ley was asked on Tuesday how the government could reassure the public that proper care had been taken, in light of the range of environmental concerns raised by expert scientific advisers to government. She said Lintermans had been concerned about the NSW environmental impact statement and she had asked her department to speak to him. “Now it’s really important to understand that Snowy will be investing $25m in effectively netting the tunnels that lead from Tantangara reservoir in the incredibly unlikely event that … pest fish could manage to come up the tunnel into Tantangara and damage the natural environment for the stocky galaxia. So we’ve got it covered.” There would also be a $5m captive breeding program in a separately built weir, Ley added. It’s not the first time the federal government has sought to highlight Snowy 2.0 as part of campaigning for the Eden-Monaro byelection. The Liberal candidate also introduced Morrison at a press conference at Polo Flat on 19 June, when the prime minister declared that the government was “all in for Snowy 2.0”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/dec/29/could-covid-lockdown-have-helped-save-the-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-29T07:00:36Z","webTitle":"Could Covid lockdown have helped save the planet?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/29/could-covid-lockdown-have-helped-save-the-planet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/dec/29/could-covid-lockdown-have-helped-save-the-planet","fields":{"headline":"Could Covid lockdown have helped save the planet?","bodyText":"When lockdown began, climate scientists were horrified at the unfolding tragedy, but also intrigued to observe what they called an “inadvertent experiment” on a global scale. To what extent, they asked, would the Earth system respond to the steepest slowdown in human activity since the second world war? Environmental activists put the question more succinctly: how much would it help to save the planet? Almost one year on from the first reported Covid case, the short answer is: not enough. In fact, experts say the pandemic may have made some environmental problems worse, though there is still a narrow window of opportunity for something good to come from something bad if governments use their economic stimulus packages to promote a green recovery. During the northern hemisphere spring, when restrictions were at their strictest, the human footprint softened to a level not seen in decades. Flights halved, road traffic in the UK fell by more than 70%. Industrial emissions in China, the world’s biggest source of carbon, were down about 18% between early February and mid-March – a cut of 250m tonnes. Car use in the United States declined by 40%. So light was humankind’s touch on the Earth that seismologists were able to detect lower vibrations from “cultural noise” than before the pandemic. The respite was too short to reverse decades of destruction, but it did provide a glimpse of what the world might feel like without fossil fuels and with more space for nature. Wildlife did not have time to reclaim lost territory but it had scope for exploration. Alongside apocalyptic images of deserted roads, the internet briefly buzzed with heartwarming clips of sheep in a deserted playground in Monmouthshire, Wales, coyotes on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, wild boar snuffling through the streets of Barcelona, and deer grazing not far from the White House in Washington DC. Wildflowers flourished on roadsides because verges were cut less frequently. In the global south, the picture was more mixed. Rhino poaching declined in Tanzania due to disruption of supply chains and restrictions on cross-border movements, but bushmeat hunting, illegal firewood collection and incursions into protected areas increased in India, Nepal and Kenya because local communities lost tourist income and sought other ways to care for their families. In Brazil, traditional guardians of the Amazon have been weakened. The Xavante and Yanomami indigenous groups have been strongly impacted by the disease, and the lockdown has kept forest rangers at home. Meanwhile, land grabbers, fire-starters and illegal miners were busier than ever. Deforestation in Brazil hit a 12-year high. Elsewhere, there were health gains, though probably not enough to offset the losses. Providing a little relief from rising Covid death tolls were projections in Europe of at least 11,000 fewer fatalities from air pollution. Breathing cleaner air also meant 6,000 fewer children developing asthma, 1,900 avoiding A&amp;E visits and 600 fewer being born preterm. In the UK, 2 million people with respiratory conditions experienced reduced symptoms. The change was visible from space, where satellite picked up clear reductions of smog belts over Wuhan in China and Turin in Italy. Residents in many cities could also see the difference. In Kathmandu, Nepal, residents were astonished to make out Mount Everest for the first time in decades. In Manila, the Sierra Madre became visible again. But the gains were short-lived. Once lockdown eased, traffic surged back and so did air pollution. In a survey of 49 British towns and cities, 80% had contamination levels that were now the same or worse than before the pandemic. Elsewhere, sightings of distant mountain peaks and wild animals are fading in the memory. The story is equally disheartening when it comes to global carbon emissions, which fell steeply but not for long enough to dent climate fears. Months of empty roads and skies and sluggish economic activity reduced global greenhouse gas discharges by an estimated 7%, the sharpest annual fall ever recorded. That is a saving of 1.5 to 2.5bn metric tons of CO2 pollution, but it merely slowed the accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere, leaving the world on course for more than 3.2C of warming by the end of this century. In its annual emissions gap report, the United Nations environment programme said the impact of the lockdown was “negligible”, equivalent to just 0.01Cdifference by 2030. On a more optimistic note, it said ambitious green recovery spending could put the world back on track for the Paris agreement target of less than 2C of warming. There is scant sign of that so far. Although China, the EU, the UK, Japan and South Korea have all recently announced carbon neutral targets by the mid-century, no nation is doing enough to achieve such a goal. Most stimulus spending is going to fossil fuel industries that are making the climate worse rather than to renewables that could make it better. These twisted priorities have raised concerns that the Covid lockdown may end up like the 2008-09 financial crisis, which led to a brief fall in emissions followed by a surge back to record highs. “Based on how little of the roughly $15tn in stimulus spending has gone to green energy and clean tech, I think Covid will delay the transition to a carbon-free future,” said Rob Jackson, the chair of Global Carbon Project. In China, he said, emissions were already back to 2019 levels, while other governments were using the pandemic as an excuse to delay climate action in the aviation sector. In the US, Donald Trump has gone further in his demonstration of crisis capitalism by rolling back a raft of environmental protections and ramping up support for fossil fuels. The situation is not entirely bleak. This exceptional year has strengthened the economic argument for renewable energy, which has proved a robust, cheap alternative during the lockdown. Analysts predict 2020 will confirm the terminal decline of coal, the dirtiest of fuels, and also heighten doubts about investments in oil. Crude prices at one point fell to minus dollars a barrel. By comparison, wind and solar power is stable and clean. “The virus has highlighted the health damage of oil-based transportation through air pollution. We caught a glimpse of a future with cleaner air in our cities without fossil fuel pollution from vehicles,” Jackson said. Whether this is a blip or a turning point depends on action at the national and international level. As the climate-limp stimulus packages have shown, national governments are reluctant to change direction alone. Global cooperation is therefore essential. But here too, coronavirus has proved an impediment. World leaders were supposed to meet in Glasgow this month for a UN climate summit that was designed to ramp up ambition, but that physical meeting had to be postponed until 2021. The virtual gathering that the UK hosts organised instead barely maintained the momentum. Very few of the participating nations came forward with concrete steps. It was a similar story with international biodiversity talks that were supposed to have taken place in Kunming. They have been pushed back until next May at the earliest and recalcitrant nations such as Brazil have been accused of impeding progress by throwing up questions about online processes. As with the climate, it would not be accurate to say this was a lost year in international decision-making, but schedules have definitely been set back even as world leaders warn that time is running out. The necessity for action was driven home by another year of horrifying climate news: 2020 saw record smoke plumes from bushfires in Australia, a freakishly protracted heatwave in Siberia, the most tropical storms ever registered in the Atlantic, devastating blazes in Brazil’s Pantanal wetlands, the highest flood levels recorded in east Africa, unusually devastating cyclones and typhoons in India, Indonesia and the Philippines, the hottest northern hemisphere summer in history, and temperature records in the Antarctic and the Arctic, where winter ice formation was delayed for longer than in any season in the satellite era. January and November registered all-time heat records, while 2020 as a whole is certain to ensure the last seven years are the hottest since measurements began. The interconnectedness of the world’s multiple crises is also increasingly apparent. Epidemiologists and conservationists have warned that outbreaks of coronavirus-like diseases are more likely in the future as a result of deforestation, global heating and humankind’s treatment of nature. “The emergence of the pandemic is not an accident, as there have been repeated warnings for years that we were exerting too much pressure on the natural world by our destructive practices. Habitat loss, intensive agriculture and the over-exploitation of wildlife are key drivers of the emergence of novel infectious diseases like Covid,” said Paul De Ornellas, chief wildlife adviser at WWF-UK. The secretary general of the UN, António Guterres, went further. In an impassioned state of the planet address this month, he declared making peace with nature the defining task of the 21st century. “Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal,” he said. “Nature always strikes back – and it is already doing so with growing force and fury” Work on a truce will have a better chance of getting under way next year with a new vaccine, a new president in the White House, a newfound respect for science and a new awareness of how rapidly change can come. It remains to be seen whether that leads to transformative improvement of the Earth system or a resumption of tinkering around the edges."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/mar/27/utrecht-rooftops-greened-plants-mosses-vertical-forest","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-27T14:02:21Z","webTitle":"Utrecht rooftops to be ‘greened’ with plants and mosses in new plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/utrecht-rooftops-greened-plants-mosses-vertical-forest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/mar/27/utrecht-rooftops-greened-plants-mosses-vertical-forest","fields":{"headline":"Utrecht rooftops to be ‘greened’ with plants and mosses in new plan","bodyText":"Every roof in the city district of Utrecht is to be “greened” with plants and mosses or have solar panels installed under plans driven by the success of a similar scheme for the municipality’s bus stops. The “no roofs unused” policy is part of an attempt to reinvigorate biodiversity in the city and create a less stressful and happier environment, of which the construction of a so-called “vertical forest tower with 10,000 plants on its facade is set to become a leading example. That building alone, close to Utrecht railway station, will host 360 trees and 9,640 shrubs and flowers, equal to 1 hectare (2.47 acres) of woods, once it is completed in 2022. More generally, a plan set to be agreed by the city council next September will introduce an obligation to green the roofs of all the buildings in the city district. The municipality already runs an oversubscribed grant scheme to cover 50% of the costs for homeowners who want to green their roofs, up to a maximum of €20,000 (£17,900) per application. Alderman Kees Diepeveen said: “In this city district every roof will be either used for green or for solar panels. It will be that when you look at the different heights, the lower rooftops will be mainly green and the higher ones will be mainly solar panels. And now again a combination of the two because solar panels need some cooling. “The green can offer the cooling for the solar panels to function properly. It will be a regulation: all roofs are used.” Utrecht, the fastest growing city in the Netherlands, was rated in a 2019 study by Natuur &amp; Milieu as the most “sustainable” in the country in terms of buying green electricity, its use of environmental zones, exploitation of solar power and encouragement of cycling. The municipality completed the installation of green roofs on its 316 bus stops last year, capturing fine particles of air pollution, storing rainwater, and providing cooling during the summer months. The bus stops roofs are planted with sedum, a plant with small yellow flowers in the summer months, draws birds, bees and butterflies. The bus stops, fitted with bamboo benches, feature energy-efficient LED lighting and 96 of them have been outfitted with solar panels. The bases of the shelters are made of recycled concrete and the municipality says the maintenance will be carried out solely by electric vehicles. The city, the fourth largest in the Netherlands, plans to use “completely clean public transport” by 2028 with the electricity used to power the buses being produced by Dutch windmills. The 300ft-high Utrecht vertical forest, a landmark building in the newly greened city centre, will comprise 200 apartments. Its facade, roof and balconies will be filled with around half the trees and shrubs presently found in Central Park in New York. Its developers claim it will absorb about 5.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year and produce about 41 tonnes of oxygen, equivalent to that generated by a hectare of forest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/jun/07/renewable-energy-stimulus-three-times-as-many-australia-jobs-fossil-fuels-coronavirus-economic-recovery","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-07T00:11:00Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy stimulus can create three times as many Australian jobs as fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/07/renewable-energy-stimulus-three-times-as-many-australia-jobs-fossil-fuels-coronavirus-economic-recovery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/jun/07/renewable-energy-stimulus-three-times-as-many-australia-jobs-fossil-fuels-coronavirus-economic-recovery","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy stimulus can create three times as many Australian jobs as fossil fuels","bodyText":"Stimulus programs backing clean energy as a path out of recession would create nearly three times as many jobs for every dollar spent on fossil fuel developments, according to a financial consultancy analysis. The assessment by professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young (EY) says a government focus on renewable energy and climate-friendly projects to drive the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic could create more than 100,000 direct jobs across the country while cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Commissioned by environment group the World Wide Fund for Nature, the EY report suggests fast-tracking wind and solar farms that have already been approved, increasing electricity transmission capacity and backing new industries in battery manufacturing, electric buses, renewable hydrogen and manufacturing powered by renewable energy. It estimates every $1m spent on renewable energy and exports creates 4.8 full-time jobs in renewable infrastructure or 4.95 jobs in energy efficiency. By comparison, $1m on fossil fuel projects has been found to create 1.7 full-time jobs. That suggests that if 10% of what the federal and state governments had indicated they would spend in response to Covid-19 was directed towards clean projects it could create 160,000 jobs. “It represents a fraction of the immediate government stimulus package while generating significant job numbers and reorienting the economy towards a more strategic, low-carbon trajectory,” it says. It follows a push by the United Nations, banks, investors and financial institutions, and a cross-sector collection of groups representing much of Australian society including business organisations for measures to help recovery from Covid-19 to also address the climate crisis. While several countries, including the European Union, South Korea and Canada, have backed green recovery measures, an analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance found the vast majority of stimulus money so far announced by governments would prop up the fossil fuel economy. The Morrison government has called for a recovery built on gas. The EY report suggests about 58,000 jobs could be created in construction by clearing the way to accelerate the development of solar and wind farms that had already been planned. WWF also called for a federal renewables stimulus package of nearly $2bn, including 90% to be spent in the next two years, saying it could generate nearly $10bn of economic benefits. The largest portion, $520m, would be spent on improving energy efficiency and increasing renewable energy in manufacturing, with a goal of Australia becoming a global clean energy manufacturing hub. Other recommended programs would help create manufacturing industries in batteries and electric buses and cut the cost of solar power for thousands of community organisations. It also recommends further boosting support for renewable hydrogen, which the government and industry have identified as a potential major export industry and local energy source. Nicky Ison, WWF Australia’s energy transition manager, said federal, state and territory governments had an opportunity to rebuild the economy in a way that set it up for prosperity in a world that valued low-carbon goods, in line with the Paris agreement. She said an energy efficiency drive was a “no regrets” approach as it cut emissions while improving productivity, and an economic rebuild based on renewable energy could re-employ people in industries that had suffered some of the biggest job losses, including construction, manufacturing and professional, scientific and technical services. “We think that this is a moment. The economy was struggling before the Covid crisis and it is struggling even more now, but a clean stimulus package can address issues holding back renewables and get the ball rolling on more than 100,000 jobs,” she said. A leaked report by a taskforce advising Australia’s National Covid Coordinating Commission focused on finding ways to lower the cost of gas to help manufacturing recover and did not considers alternatives. Government agencies have found renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels. The commission’s chair, Nev Power, later distanced himself from the recommendations in the leaked report but backed gas as central to the recovery. An assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commissioned at the Paris summit by all signatories including Australia, found limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels was likely to require the world reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The Morrison government has not set this target for Australia. Scientific analyses have found under current policies the world is currently headed for more than 3C of warming, an increase scientists have warned would lead to significant ecological collapse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/mar/02/the-guardian-view-on-an-energy-u-turn-the-winds-of-change","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-02T18:36:21Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on an energy U-turn: the winds of change | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/02/the-guardian-view-on-an-energy-u-turn-the-winds-of-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/02/the-guardian-view-on-an-energy-u-turn-the-winds-of-change","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on an energy U-turn: the winds of change","bodyText":"The government’s decision to overturn an effective five-year-old ban on new onshore wind power generation is hugely welcome. Wind provides the cheapest energy, with the first subsidy-free contracts for offshore projects awarded last year. Onshore wind is even cheaper. It is also popular, scoring above other infrastructure (including roads and railway stations) in opinion polls despite the efforts of climate denialists to portray it as a public nuisance. Most importantly, it is renewable and very low-carbon. Unlike oil, gas and coal, wind does not produce greenhouse gases (apart from in the initial phase of manufacturing and installation) and is not something we can run out of. Unlike nuclear, it does not produce toxic waste as a byproduct. The government’s climate advisers say that onshore wind power capacity will need to triple in 15 years if the UK is to meet the target of net-zero emissions by 2050. This is a huge challenge, and forms just one part of an even bigger one. The good news is that the UK’s wind sector is already – and despite David Cameron’s foolish decision to stymie it – a world-beating one. While the solar power industry was seriously damaged by the removal of subsidies, with domestic installations collapsing after the withdrawal of feed-in tariffs, wind companies were able to shift resources and expertise offshore. Ministers must not be allowed to sit on their laurels. Wind and solar will not solve all our energy problems and research and development into battery storage, carbon capture and renewable power projects of all kinds are urgently needed. Systematic retrofitting of the UK’s aged housing stock, to increase energy efficiency, has been shamefully neglected. Having promised that the public will, in future, have a greater say over wind developments through an altered planning process, ministers must now ensure that all new housing and construction projects are compatible with climate goals. But if Boris Johnson’s government should expect limited credit for reversing a destructive decision that many of its own ministers supported, the significance of Monday’s announcement should not be underestimated. Under the last two prime ministers, energy policy often appeared more ideological than rational. While environmental campaigners of all stripes, including some Conservatives, argued in vain on behalf of renewables, ministers consistently (and in the teeth of furious local opposition) sided with frackers. That chapter has now ended. The UK’s fracking industry has all but collapsed. The influence on public life of climate deniers including former chancellor Nigel Lawson has dramatically waned – with 2019’s upsurge of climate activism among the causes. The UK has a mountain to climb to reach emissions targets, and the government’s record so far is not encouraging. But the return of onshore wind is a breath of fresh air."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2020/feb/16/scottish-power-launches-new-100-green-energy-tariff","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-16T14:38:41Z","webTitle":"Scottish Power launches 100% green energy tariff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/16/scottish-power-launches-new-100-green-energy-tariff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/feb/16/scottish-power-launches-new-100-green-energy-tariff","fields":{"headline":"Scottish Power launches 100% green energy tariff","bodyText":"Scottish Power is launching a new tariff in which it guarantees that 100% of the electricity will come from its own renewable energy projects, to mark it out from so-called “greenwashing” energy deals that are not as clean as they seem. The consumer group Which? found that many suppliers are misleading eco-conscious customers by claiming to offer renewable energy tariffs without ever investing in renewable energy projects. Which? said that “pale green” suppliers are boasting green credentials by exploiting an industry loophole enabling them to buy cheap renewable energy certificates to match the electricity they supply to customers, while buying the power from another source. Ofgem, the energy regulator, said earlier this month that it was aware of growing concerns about greenwashing in the energy market and would take action to ensure consumers were not misled. Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, said: “With an increasing number of green tariffs in the market, it’s important that consumers understand how ‘green’ their tariff is in terms of supporting the UK renewables industry.” Green energy developers typically sell renewable certificates alongside their electricity supply deals so that buyers can prove the origins of their energy. But industry rules mean the initial buyer is free to sell the certificates, without selling the green energy, to a second buyer. “There are lots of suppliers running around, slapping a bit of green paint on their logo and trading bits of paper to claim they’re green. But buying and selling certificates doesn’t help tackle climate change – building wind farms and solar projects is what we need to do,” Anderson added. Scottish Power sold off all its fossil fuel projects in 2018 to focus on growing its stable of onshore and offshore wind farms, and developing a portfolio of solar power projects. Anderson said the company would reinvest money made from the green tariffs in a new renewable generation, “meaning the more people who take up the tariff, the more investment in green energy there will be”. He added: “As the UK’s only end-to-end energy provider, we’re unique in being able to make this commitment. From today, anyone who signs up for our electricity on a fixed-price tariff can be confident that they are buying electricity from truly green sources.” • This article was amended on 26 February 2020 to remove a reference to small green energy companies being able to supply customers with electricity sourced exclusively from their own wind and solar farms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/jan/07/toyota-city-of-the-future-japan-mount-fuji","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-07T06:19:50Z","webTitle":"Toyota unveils plan to build 'city of the future' near Mount Fuji","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/07/toyota-city-of-the-future-japan-mount-fuji","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/jan/07/toyota-city-of-the-future-japan-mount-fuji","fields":{"headline":"Toyota unveils plan to build 'city of the future' near Mount Fuji","bodyText":"Toyota has unveiled plans to build a sustainable “city of the future” near Mount Fuji that will run on hydrogen fuel cells and become a living laboratory for self-driving vehicles, robotics and artificial intelligence. The Japanese carmaker said Woven City, covering 70hectares on the site of a factory that is due for closure, would be home to full-time residents and researchers. The name is a reference to the firm’s origins as a loom manufacturer. The prototype city, announced at the CES technology show in Las Vegas, will host a futuristic community that will cut carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles and buildings and use internet technology in practically every aspect of daily life. Toyota said about 2,000 people, mostly the firm’s employees, would live in the city to begin with and construction was due to start next year. The city was designed by Bjarke Ingels, the Danish architect whose firm was behind the 2 World Trade Centre building in New York and Google’s offices in Silicon Valley and London. “Connected, autonomous, emission-free and shared mobility solutions are bound to unleash a world of opportunities for new forms of urban life,” Ingels said. Toyota’s chief executive, Akio Toyoda, described the utopian vision as his “personal field of dreams”. “You know that if you build it, they will come,” he said. “I believe it is up to all of us, especially corporations like Toyota, to do our part to help make the world a better place. Woven City is one small but hopefully significant step towards fulfilling that promise.” Toyota said the city would be “fully sustainable”, with buildings made mostly of wood to minimise the carbon footprint. “The rooftops will be covered in photovoltaic panels to generate solar power in addition to power generated by hydrogen fuel cells.” Other businesses would be free to collaborate on the project, the firm said, adding that it would invite scientists and researchers from around the world to use Woven City as their “real-world incubator”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/jun/30/boris-johnson-new-deal-tuc-cbi","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-30T14:38:52Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson's 'new deal' speech: what is missing?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/30/boris-johnson-new-deal-tuc-cbi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/jun/30/boris-johnson-new-deal-tuc-cbi","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson's 'new deal' speech: what is missing?","bodyText":"Business leaders and trade unions have warned Boris Johnson that his plan to reboot the British economy from the coronavirus pandemic is not big enough to protect jobs and boost growth. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI, said the prime minister’s speech could build the foundations for recovery, but she added: “Foundations are there to be built on. More is needed to prevent the uneven scarring unemployment leaves on communities.” Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, also said more was required adding: “Today we face the biggest economic crisis in a generation. Without big, fast action, millions face the misery of unemployment. Today’s announcements from the prime minister fall far short of what is needed.” The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to announce the details of the government’s stimulus package next week to show that the government can match the scale of Johnson’s ambition. Critics have called for several measures that were missing from Johnson’s speech. Scale of spending Unions attacked the scale of the prime minister’s £5bn spending plan for infrastructure, saying it was reheated from old announcements. The TUC said to match the US New Deal of the 1930s, invoked by Johnson, the government would need to increase spending by £30bn a year. The GMB union said £5bn would fill less than half of the potholes in England and Wales. The Health Foundation thinktank said the funds would only go a short way to addressing years of underinvestment in the health service’s physical infrastructure, which has led to a maintenance backlog of over £6.5bn in NHS trusts. Furlough scheme The coronavirus job retention scheme – paying 80% of the wages of 9.3 million workers – is due to be wound down from the end of next month and closed entirely at the end of October. The government is under increasing pressure to extend the scheme to protect jobs. Sunak is also being urged to provide extra support to the hardest-hit sectors of the economy – such as hospitality and retail. Training and skills Johnson’s speech focused on infrastructure spending, but business leaders and unions are also calling for extra government funding to help people who lose their jobs retrain to work elsewhere. “Investments in nursery teachers and on- and offline learning opportunities, as well as doctors, nurses and social workers, can be just as beneficial as investments in trains and brick and mortar,” said Charlotte Alldritt, the director of the Centre for Progressive Policy. Housing Johnson’s plan focused on relaxing housing rules alongside £12bn of funding for affordable homes over the next eight years. However, the IPPR thinktank estimates £15bn a year is required to meet Britain’s affordable housing needs. Energy efficiency There was no mention of the £9.2bn promised in the Conservative manifesto for refurbishing Britain’s draughty homes, the leakiest housing stock in Europe. Yet economists, engineers and green campaigners all agree that upgrading buildings to make them energy efficient is one of the quickest ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as well as reducing energy bills for the fuel-poor and creating new jobs. There are still hopes Sunak could announce a home improvement scheme next week. Transport Most of the initiatives the prime minister announced – on net-zero buses and cycle route upgrades – were re-statements of existing commitments, according to green analysts, while road-building motors ahead. There is still little substantial policy on electric vehicles beyond the deadline of 2035 for the phase-out of diesel and petrol vehicles. Manufacturers warn electric vehicle charging infrastructure is not being built fast enough, and car-owners are being given few incentives to turn away from the SUVs that have taken an increasing share of the market. No plans for a frequent flyer levy or other green strings to the airline bailouts, and the net-zero plane the prime minister mentioned will do nothing to reduce aviation emissions in the crucial next decade. Car scrappage schemes are being used in Germany and France to promote sales of electric vehicles to stimulate economic growth, while helping to reduce carbon emissions. The UK government is under pressure to offer similar schemes in Britain. Renewable energy Hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, wind and solar power all got a name-check, but there is scant new policy to encourage the construction of new wind farms – the cheapest form of new power generation. Offshore wind companies were hoping that at least the government-imposed cap on their investments would be lifted to enable them to build more, and for a boost to the electricity grid that would make it easier for new renewable energy plants to be brought on-stream. The International Energy Agency and the government’s own Committee on Climate Change have advocated renewable energy, as well as energy efficiency, as one of the key pillars of a job-creating green recovery. Nature Tree planting was in the Conservative manifesto, and the commitment was restated with £40m promised. However, campaigners say the sum is far too small and that about £350m is needed for the programme. Tax changes Many businesses are calling for a cut in VAT, from the current rate of 20%, to encourage consumer spending. Business leaders are calling for business rates holidays and reductions in employers’ national insurance contributions. The chancellor is also facing pressure to raise taxes on the wealthy to help fund the coronavirus response. However, the Conservatives made manifesto pledges not to raise income tax, VAT or national insurance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/jul/31/clean-energy-set-to-provide-35-of-australias-electricity-within-two-years","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-30T18:00:21Z","webTitle":"Clean energy set to provide 35% of Australia's electricity within two years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/31/clean-energy-set-to-provide-35-of-australias-electricity-within-two-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/jul/31/clean-energy-set-to-provide-35-of-australias-electricity-within-two-years","fields":{"headline":"Clean energy set to provide 35% of Australia's electricity within two years","bodyText":"Clean energy will be providing 35% of Australia’s total electricity needs within two years, analysts say, as new data underlines the pace at which solar power is transforming the national energy market. A report by consultants Green Energy Markets found rooftop solar systems and new large-scale farms regularly pushed renewable energy to beyond 30% of generation at midday during June, one of the least sunny months. Wind, hydro and solar power made up 22.3% of electricity used across the month. The level of clean energy in the system at one time peaked at 39.2% in the middle of the day on 30 June. Tristan Edis, a Green Energy Markets director and analyst, said clean energy growth would continue in the short term as a number of projects were in development and yet to come online. But he said the boom was expected to end in the absence of a policy to encourage further investments. He said he expected clean energy would provide on average 35% electricity by 2021. “What we are seeing now is just a glimpse of what’s ahead because you’ve still got a substantial number of solar farms coming through,” Edis said. “We’re going to be regularly having 50% of renewables – solar, wind and hydro – across the national electricity market in the middle of the day in the next 12 months. But it is also soon going to get hard to get new stuff built.” A report by the Clean Energy Regulator last week found enough projects were committed to meet the 2020 renewable energy target, roughly equivalent to 23% of electricity. While most recent investment has been driven by incentives attached to the target, and to a lesser extent a state target in Victoria, large-scale clean plants have been funded on a commercial basis by businesses wanting to lock in cheap solar and wind deals while wholesale electricity prices were high. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Edis said this would end as abundant free solar power during the day reduced wholesale prices to a level where investment in any type of new large-scale generation was not financially attractive. In the absence of federal policy to drive grid transformation, he said investment was likely to slow until the circumstances in the market changed – for example, a coal-fired power plant closed, reducing supply. He said the tumbling price of wholesale electricity in the middle of the day, in some cases to $0, would make life harder for coal-fired power plants that could not compete on price around the clock but by design usually could not be turned off and on. Those coal plants that could be turned off and on would increasingly be used in a similar way to gas peaking plants, which sell electricity only when they are needed. “It just shows how crazy this idea is that we should go and build another coal-fired generator to run as baseload,” Edis said. “If we do that it just means another coal-fired power plant is going to shut down because nothing can outcompete solar and wind.” Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity are expected to continue to be reduced in the short-term, but at a slower pace than experts say is possible or necessary for Australia to do its part under the Paris climate agreement. While federal data released last month found emissions from electricity were down, national emissions continue to rise due to increased carbon pollution from the resources industry, mostly liquefied natural gas production for export, and transport. ‘Any of them could do the job’ At an Australian clean energy summit in Sydney on Tuesday, the Clean Energy Council chief executive, Kane Thornton, said it had been a record-breaking two years, with more than $24bn worth of large-scale renewable energy projects, solar panels on 2m homes and the world’s biggest battery based in South Australia. But he said a survey of 75 chief executives showed industry confidence had fallen since December due to policy uncertainty, growing constraints on the grid and the pace at which regulations and markets that had been designed for last century were having to be changed. The survey found energy bosses believed the single greatest challenge facing the industry was getting new farms and plants connected to the grid. A lack of energy and climate policy was the second biggest challenge. “The economics of clean energy continues to improve and we no longer require subsidy,” Thornton said. “But the wholesale market is riddled with uncertainty.” He said collaboration on energy between the commonwealth and the states was near non-existent, noting federal and state ministers energy ministers had not met for eight months and no meeting was planned. Thornton said a sensible energy policy could accelerate investment, drive down power prices and deliver jobs in rural areas. The industry did not mind whether the policy was the abandoned national energy guarantee, an extended renewable energy target, the clean energy target proposed by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, or a baseline-and-credit trading scheme. “Any of them could do the job,” he said. NSW threatens to go it alone Matt Kean, the New South Wales energy and environment minister, repeated his warning that the Berejiklian government would introduce its own climate and energy policy if the federal government did not act. “The NSW government still supports the national energy guarantee and will continue to support a national mechanism that integrates climate and energy policy,” he told the summit. “As I’ve said before, if the commonwealth won’t get on board NSW will consider going it alone.” Kean said NSW wanted to be known as the easiest jurisdiction in the OECD for energy construction. Thornton said the industry was still on track for 50% clean energy before 2030 and a fully renewable energy system was now inevitable and could be achieved well before mid-century. He said the next stage would be decarbonising other sectors such as transport and building a renewable export industry selling green hydrogen and clean energy via undersea cable. “It’s now time we started debating when Australia should target 200% renewable energy generation,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/may/22/uk-approval-for-biggest-gas-power-station-europe-ruled-legal-high-court-climate-planning","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-22T14:31:14Z","webTitle":"UK approval for biggest gas power station in Europe ruled legal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/22/uk-approval-for-biggest-gas-power-station-europe-ruled-legal-high-court-climate-planning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/may/22/uk-approval-for-biggest-gas-power-station-europe-ruled-legal-high-court-climate-planning","fields":{"headline":"UK approval for biggest gas power station in Europe ruled legal","bodyText":"The UK government’s approval of a large new gas-fired power plant has been ruled legal by the high court. A legal challenge was brought after ministers overruled climate change objections from planning authorities. The plant, which is being developed by Drax in North Yorkshire, would be the biggest gas power station in Europe, and could account for 75% of the UK’s power sector emissions when fully operational, according to lawyers for ClientEarth, which brought the judicial review. The planning inspectorate recommended that ministers refuse permission for the 3.6GW gas plant because it “would undermine the government’s commitment, as set out in the Climate Change Act 2008, to cut greenhouse emissions” by having “significant adverse effects”. It was the first big project rejected by planners because of the climate crisis. However, Andrea Leadsom, who was secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy at the time of the planning application, rejected the advice and gave the go-ahead in October. The government’s actions to tackle the climate emergency are under particular scrutiny at the moment as the UK will host a UN summit in early 2021. At the meeting, nations will need to dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions to avoid a disastrous 3-4C rise in global temperatures. For the summit to be successful, experts say, the host nation needs to take a leadership role at home. Sam Hunter Jones, a lawyer at ClientEarth, said: “We’re very dissatisfied by today’s judgment, rejecting our arguments against the lawfulness of the government’s decision and of its approach to assessing the project’s carbon lock-in risk. We will consider an appeal.” A Drax spokeswoman said: “Drax power station plays a vital role in the UK’s energy system, generating reliable, flexible electricity for millions of homes and businesses. The development of new high-efficiency gas power would support the UK’s decarbonising energy system.” She said the company’s ambition was to remove, not add, carbon to the atmosphere by 2030. It would do this by burning wood or plants and then capturing and storing the emissions. The gas plant is capable of having carbon capture technology fitted in the future, the company says. John Sauven, the head of Greenpeace UK, said: “Building new gas-fired power stations when the UK has a net zero carbon target is hardly showing climate leadership. It also makes little economic sense. The costs are already higher than for renewable options like wind and solar. Investing money to increase pollution may still be legal but it’s no longer defensible.” ClientEarth argued that the combination of the project’s large scale, level of emissions and long operating life made it a significant threat to the UK’s carbon targets. The group has previously inflicted three defeats on ministers over their failure to tackle air pollution. The planning inspectorate concluded that wind and solar power would cut energy bills for consumers, while the proposed gas plant would not. “Both [Drax] and [National Grid] confirmed that it is the production of renewable plants that will deliver cheaper energy,” it said. This year there have been a series of legal actions against polluting infrastructure projects on climate grounds. Last week the Good Law Project launched a legal action over decade-old energy policies that it said the government was using to approve fossil fuel projects such as Drax’s gas plant, even after ministers had pledged to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. In April, Transport Action Network launched a legal challenge to try to prevent billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money being spent on a huge road-building programme, which it said breached the UK’s legal commitments to tackle the climate crisis and air pollution. In February the court of appeal ruled that plans for a third runway at Heathrow airport were illegal because ministers did not adequately take into account the government’s climate commitments. This was the first major ruling in the world to be based on the 2015 Paris climate change agreement. Heathrow is seeking to overturn this decision in the supreme court. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We welcome the high court’s ruling issued today which supports the secretary of state’s decision to grant consent for the Drax repowering project. We are going further and faster than any other major economy in taking action on climate change. “As we transition to net zero emissions in 2050, natural gas can provide a reliable source of energy while our world class renewables sector continues to grow, supported by record levels of investment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2019/nov/17/how-do-the-parties-propose-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-election","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-17T16:07:26Z","webTitle":"How do the parties propose to tackle the climate crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/17/how-do-the-parties-propose-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2019/nov/17/how-do-the-parties-propose-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-election","fields":{"headline":"How do the parties propose to tackle the climate crisis?","bodyText":"Labour Labour’s “green new deal” – or “green industrial revolution” – puts a radical environmental plan at the heart of the party’s election offer. It proposes a massive programme of state investment to rapidly decarbonise the economy, which it says would create hundreds of thousands of green jobs. The party says the programme would also transform the way people live – from upgrading the UK’s entire housing stock and revitalising public transport to boosting renewable wind and solar industries and decarbonising the country’s energy supply. Although the initial investment would be large, advocates say that would be dwarfed by the cost of not tackling the escalating climate crisis and point to wide-ranging economic benefits, which experts say would total at least £800bn by 2030. The green new deal aims to tie far-reaching environmental action to a worker-led “just transition”, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by – and benefits – ordinary people. The party, which at its conference backed plans to hit zero emissions by 2030, has also said it would ban fracking and boost electric car infrastructure. Conservatives The Tories say they want to double science and research spending to £18bn in the next parliament, with an unspecified amount going to new green technology. The party says it also wants to increase the number of public electric vehicle charging points so that everyone in England and Wales is within 30 miles of a charging point, with an investment of £500m. The party, which has been criticised over its record on onshore wind and solar power, says it will build more offshore windfarms, increasing the UK’s target capacity from 30GW to 40GW by 2030. It has also announced plans to plant 30m trees a year by 2025. It would create “clusters” of carbon capture and storage expertise around the country for £800m in the next decade, and a cabinet-level committee will oversee the commitment to reach its target of net zero carbon by 2050. It has also announced a review of the HS2 high-speed rail project and a moratorium on fracking. Liberal Democrats The party says it will establish citizens’ assemblies to thrash out new policy measures to tackle the climate emergency. It wants to revive the green investment bank, sold off by George Osborne, and end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030. It would support onshore and offshore wind and solar power, with a target of 80% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030, and says all new homes would be fitted with solar panels. It says it would declare a nature crisis and work towards an international Paris-style agreement on preserving the natural world and biodiversity. It has pledged to plant 60m trees a year and impose a moratorium on airport expansion, including Heathrow. The party would ban fracking and new coalmines and has set a net zero target of 2045. Green party The Greens say they would raise £100bn by borrowing every year for the next 10 years to pay for tackling the climate crisis through upgrading infrastructure, including shifting electricity generation to a low-carbon footing, insulating the UK’s draughty housing stock and expanding public transport. They aim to bring forward the UK’s target for net zero carbon from 2050 to 2030 and would scrap nuclear power and expand renewable energy. They are in favour of ending airport expansion, including Heathrow, scrapping HS2 and halting the current road-building plan, spending the money instead on local transport improvements. They would ban fracking and all fossil fuel expansion. SNP The SNP is aiming for a 75% reduction of all emissions by 2030, net-zero carbon by 2040 and net zero for all emissions by 2045. It is proposing to “phase out the need” for petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2032, investing in active and sustainable travel by doubling cash for walking and cycling to £80m a year. It is introducing a deposit return scheme for drink containers to increase recycling and reduce littering. And an expert panel is looking at what else can be done to reduce demand for single-use items. It has banned fracking and underground coal gasification and says it is “championing the principle” of climate justice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/nov/11/climate-heroes-the-countries-pioneering-a-green-future","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-11T10:00:35Z","webTitle":"Climate heroes: the countries pioneering a green future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/11/climate-heroes-the-countries-pioneering-a-green-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/nov/11/climate-heroes-the-countries-pioneering-a-green-future","fields":{"headline":"Climate heroes: the countries pioneering a green future","bodyText":"While the world must wait to see whether US president-elect Joe Biden can fulfil his election promise of a $2tn Green New Deal, nations elsewhere in the world are setting carbon-neutral targets and pushing ahead with mega-programmes to cut emissions, create jobs and reduce energy prices. Here are some of the regional frontrunners. Europe: Spain Under the coalition of its socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, Spain has picked up the pace from a jog to a run in its break from fossil fuels this year, and is now one of the countries leading the European pack. Last week, the government was the latest to announce plans to go carbon neutral by 2050 and it is overseeing one of the fastest shifts away from coal the world has seen. Over the coming three years, Spain has committed €27bn to green energy spending – a downpayment on the €750bn investment it forecasts will be needed to fund the move away from fossil fuels. By 2050, the decarbonisation strategy envisages a 90% reduction in emissions, the reforestation of 20,000 hectares and the recovery of 50,000 hectares of wetlands. Renewable power, meanwhile, will rise from 20% of the energy mix to 97%. Action is already under way. In May, the cabinet approved a draft law on climate change, which outlined more ambitious goals than the EU at the time on renewables and energy efficiency. The bill would ban new coal, oil and gas extraction projects and end direct fossil fuel subsidies. Spain is also shutting down 69% of its coal-fired power plants this year and next – a pace of decommissioning not seen anywhere else in the world. Last year, Spain installed more new onshore wind than any other country in Europe. Far from being a drain on employment and economy, the Spanish government says its decarbonisation plan will increase the workforce by 1.6%. But the country will have to convince investors that its legal framework is more stable this time than during the “solar garden” bubble that followed subsidy promises in 2007. When those were abolished, confidence in the sector took at hit along with jobs. The ecological transition minister, Teresa Ribera, predicts the country will go well beyond the 2030 targets set by the European commission and has promised to push for still more ambitious policies in Spain and elsewhere in Europe. This is part of a broader trend. In Europe, renewables have generated more power than coal for the first time this year. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said she wants Europe to be the world’s first carbon-neutral continent. Over the next 10 years, the commission forecasts investment of at least €1tn to achieve this goal, including a quarter of the EU budget. This month, the European parliament voted in favour of climate neutrality by 2050 and 60% cuts in emissions by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels). Further progress has been seen in individual countries, including Denmark, Germany, France and (outside the EU) Britain. Asia: South Korea Four years after being labelled the world’s biggest carbon villain, South Korea has bid to be one of the heroes this year with a $61bn Green New Deal and a commitment to go carbon neutral by 2050. President Moon Jae-in has moved to end South Korea’s dependence on coal and create green jobs as his party promised in April’s successful election campaign for the national assembly. By 2025, the Green New Deal would bring about 230,000 more energy-saving buildings, 1.13m electric and hydrogen-powered cars, and an increase in renewable energy capacity to 42.7 GW from 12.7 GW last year. Money will also be made available to upgrade public rental housing and schools to make them zero-energy, and to expand green areas in cities. To improve energy efficiency, smart meters will be fitted in an additional 5 million apartments and communities will be given incentives to connect to micro-grids supplied with decentralised, low-carbon energy. The plan aims to support Korean industrial conglomerates that have been hard hit by the pandemic. Hyundai, Kia, Samsung and EM Korea will be among the biggest beneficiaries of plans to build 45,000 new electric vehicle charging points and 450 hydrogen refuelling units. Tempering the optimism is South Korea’s past record of high emissions and false hopes. The last time the country promised “green growth” – after the 2008-9 financial crisis – it led to an environmentally disastrous policy of more concrete riverbanks and higher emissions. Today, coal supplies about 40% of Korea’s electricity and seven new coal power plants are under construction. In 2016, activists labelled South Korea the world’s biggest carbon villain. A new generation of campaigners believe South Korea has turned a new page. They want to see an early halt to overseas coal financing and a strong 2030 target to reduce domestic emissions. They are encouraged by signs of a climate race-to-the-top in east Asia, where the opposite has long been true. China and Japan are also major users and funders of coal, but both countries have committed this year to carbon-neutral goals. Latin America: Uruguay Last year, Uruguay was ranked fourth in the world in the proportion of electricity it supplies from wind and solar. The International Energy Agency said the country’s 36% share was behind only Denmark (50%), Lithuania (41%) and Luxembourg (37%). If hydropower is added, Uruguay leaps ahead of them all with 97%. This represents a spectacular transition. Twenty years ago, this South American country burned oil to produce almost a third of its electricity and had to import power from Argentina. The change came between 2008 and 2015 under former presidents Tabaré Vázquez and José Mujica, who wanted to reduce costs and make energy more affordable. The secret was a proactive state rather than a big-spending one. Government encouraged investors by promising fixed feed-in tariffs and stable policies. More than US$7bn poured into the sector, helping Uruguay to reduce its emissions by 20%. Droughts have also been rarer because the grid is less dependent on hydropower. Asad Rehman, the co-organiser of Global Green New Deal Campaign, said the success of Uruguay’s transition reflects an ideal balance of social and climate priorities. “It is not just about carbon, but also cutting energy prices and tackling energy poverty. Social justice is an imperative.” The picture is mixed elsewhere in South and Central America. Costa Rica has won international kudos for generating almost all of its electricity with renewables, particularly geothermal and hydropower. The latter also provides most of the power for Brazil and Paraguay though it often has a devastating impact on ecosystems and wildlife. Africa: Kenya Renewables already provide more than 93% of Kenya’s electricity and the government plans to expand further so everyone in the country has access either to the grid or community solar power by 2022. The carbon footprint of the population of 47 million is tiny compared with wealthy nations in the northern hemisphere so economic – rather than climate – considerations are the main drivers for an energy transition. Solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal energy is increasingly cheaper and more practical than fossil fuels. The main challenge is securing the initial investment. The country has substantial renewable resources to tap, prompting many observers to say it has the potential to bypass fossil fuel-driven economic development. Last month, the African Development Bank announced the completion of the 105 MWe Menengai geothermal power plant in the Rift Valley, cementing Kenya’s leading role on the continent for geothermal electricity production, which has increased more than fourfold in the past six years. Kenya is also home to east Africa’s biggest solar generation plant – the $128.5m China-funded Garissa Plant where more than 200,000 PV panels soak up the energy from the sunshine each day. In many remote areas, small villages that are far from the grid are able to generate electricity with just a few dozen rooftop panels. These developments – along with expanded wind and hydropower – have pushed the proportion of the population with electricity from 63% in 2017 to 75% today. Heymi Bahar, the lead author of the International Energy Agency’s Renewables market report, said Kenya along with other African nations, such as Rwanda and Nigeria, “have a chance to leapfrog” fossil fuel energy systems if they can draw in more private investment. That once meant expensive subsidies, but Bahar said this is no longer the case. Good regulations and policies are enough. “Renewables are becoming cheaper and more accessible. In Africa, the potential is there, the willingness is there,” he said. “Renewables do not need subsidies any more. They just need long-term revenue streams. That is determined by clear policies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/mar/16/planning-applications-for-uk-clean-energy-projects-hit-new-high","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-16T07:01:19Z","webTitle":"Planning applications for UK clean energy projects hit new high","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/planning-applications-for-uk-clean-energy-projects-hit-new-high","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/mar/16/planning-applications-for-uk-clean-energy-projects-hit-new-high","fields":{"headline":"Planning applications for UK clean energy projects hit new high","bodyText":"The number of new renewable energy projects applying for planning permission reached a four-year high in the UK last year as energy companies raced to meet the rising demand for clean electricity. There were 269 planning applications for new wind, solar and bioenergy projects in 2019, up from 204 the year before, according to an analysis of government data by energy consultancy PX Group. The jump in applications last year was the biggest annual increase in recent years and 75% higher than the number of annual planning submissions made three years ago. There were just 154 submissions in 2016, rising to 185 in 2017. The consultancy said there was a growing appetite among energy companies for new renewable projects to help cut carbon emissions and reach the UK’s climate goals. Clean energy developers are also able to roll out more projects due to falling technology costs and greater support from financiers, who view renewable energy as a lucrative investment. Geoff Holmes, the chief executive of PX Group, said: “It goes without saying that as more of these projects get off the ground, the faster the UK can get to a point where clean, green sources provide an even greater share of the UK’s energy. “Of course, there is a lag time between submitting plans to councils and projects becoming fully operational, so more projects being in the pipeline is not a quick fix.” Planning submissions for clean energy projects are expected to rise in the years ahead due to the government’s decision earlier this month to lift a block against subsidising onshore wind projects that was put in place almost five years ago. From next year, onshore wind developers will be allowed to compete for subsidies at auction alongside solar power developments and floating offshore wind projects, the government said last month. There has been a sharp decline in the number of new onshore windfarms since the block was put in place by David Cameron in 2016. The rollout of new onshore wind capacity fell to its lowest level since 2015 last year, prompting warnings that the UK risked missing its climate targets. Under the new plans, windfarm developers will need to comply with tough new proposals on community consent to qualify for the auction process, and projects planned for England will also need the consent of the local community through existing planning codes. Some renewable energy developers, including Scottish Power, began plans for a big expansion of onshore windfarm projects in anticipation of a government U-turn on support for wind power projects. The chief executive of Scottish Power, Keith Anderson, said the decision to back onshore wind was “one of the first clear signs that the government really means business” on reaching its climate targets. Earlier this week, the global energy watchdog warned that governments will need to use climate policies and economic stimulus packages to support the ongoing rollout of clean energy despite the global economic slowdown triggered by the coronavirus outbreak and a crash in oil market prices. Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, said governments “should not allow today’s crisis to compromise the clean energy transition”. “These challenging market conditions will be a clear test for government commitments. But the good news is that, compared to economic stimulus packages of the past, we have much cheaper renewable technologies, have made major progress in electric vehicles and there is a supportive financial community for the clean energy transition,” he said. “If the right policies are put in place there are opportunities to make the best of this situation,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/mar/02/uk-government-lifts-block-on-new-onshore-windfarm-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-02T11:08:33Z","webTitle":"UK government lifts block on new onshore windfarm subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/02/uk-government-lifts-block-on-new-onshore-windfarm-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/mar/02/uk-government-lifts-block-on-new-onshore-windfarm-subsidies","fields":{"headline":"UK government lifts block on new onshore windfarm subsidies","bodyText":"The UK has abandoned its opposition to subsidising new onshore windfarms, four years after ministers scrapped support for new projects. The government will remove a block against onshore wind projects by allowing schemes to compete for subsidies alongside solar power developments and floating offshore wind projects, in a new auction scheme announced on Monday. The U-turn follows the government’s pledge to cut emissions to virtually zero by 2050, a feat that its official climate advisers believe will require the UK’s onshore wind-power capacity to triple in the next 15 years. The auction will take place in 2021, allowing new renewables projects to be up and running from the mid-2020s if they manage to clinch a contract that guarantees a price for the clean electricity they generate. Alok Sharma, the secretary of state for business and energy, is said that ending the UK’s contribution to the climate crisis “means making the UK a world leader in renewable energy”. The government will do this “in a way that works for everyone, listening to local communities and giving them an effective voice in decisions that affect them”, Sharma said. Windfarm developers will need to comply with tough new proposals on community consent to qualify for the auction process. Those hoping to build a windfarm in England will also need the consent of the local community through existing planning codes. Alethea Warrington, a campaigner at the climate change charity Possible, said: “We can finally celebrate the UK’s cheapest new energy source – onshore wind – being brought in from the cold. “As our cheapest source of clean energy, onshore wind is hugely popular with people in the UK, who understand that we need to use all the tools in the box to tackle the climate crisis.” Existing energy policies have led to a sharp decline in the number of new onshore windfarms since the block against onshore windfarms was put in place by David Cameron in 2016. The rollout of new onshore wind projects fell to its lowest level since 2011 last year, prompting warnings that the UK risked missing its climate targets. The chief executive of Scottish Power, Keith Anderson, said the decision to back onshore wind was “one of the first clear signs that the government really means business” on reaching its climate targets. “Onshore wind is a crucial tool in tackling climate change – it’s cheap, it’s clean and it’s quick to build. As a responsible developer, we work hard to secure the support of local communities.” The Guardian revealed late last year that Scottish Power had begun plans for a big expansion of onshore windfarm projects, totalling 3GW of new capacity across Scotland, in anticipation of a government U-turn on support for wind power projects. Hugh McNeal, the chief executive of Renewable UK, said the change would help to speed up the UK’s transition to a net zero economy and provide a “huge boost for jobs and investment in local economies across the UK”. “Backing cheap renewables is a clear example of the practical action to tackle climate change that the public is demanding,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/jun/18/world-has-six-months-to-avert-climate-crisis-says-energy-expert","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-18T04:00:38Z","webTitle":"World has six months to avert climate crisis, says energy expert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/18/world-has-six-months-to-avert-climate-crisis-says-energy-expert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/jun/18/world-has-six-months-to-avert-climate-crisis-says-energy-expert","fields":{"headline":"World has six months to avert climate crisis, says energy expert","bodyText":"The world has only six months in which to change the course of the climate crisis and prevent a post-lockdown rebound in greenhouse gas emissions that would overwhelm efforts to stave off climate catastrophe, one of the world’s foremost energy experts has warned. “This year is the last time we have, if we are not to see a carbon rebound,” said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency. Governments are planning to spend $9tn (£7.2tn) globally in the next few months on rescuing their economies from the coronavirus crisis, the IEA has calculated. The stimulus packages created this year will determine the shape of the global economy for the next three years, according to Birol, and within that time emissions must start to fall sharply and permanently, or climate targets will be out of reach. “The next three years will determine the course of the next 30 years and beyond,” Birol told the Guardian. “If we do not [take action] we will surely see a rebound in emissions. If emissions rebound, it is very difficult to see how they will be brought down in future. This is why we are urging governments to have sustainable recovery packages.” Carbon dioxide emissions plunged by a global average of 17% in April, compared with last year, but have since surged again to within about 5% of last year’s levels. In a report published on Thursday, the IEA – the world’s gold standard for energy analysis - set out the first global blueprint for a green recovery, focusing on reforms to energy generation and consumption. Wind and solar power should be a top focus, the report advised, alongside energy efficiency improvements to buildings and industries, and the modernisation of electricity grids. Creating jobs must be the priority for countries where millions have been thrown into unemployment by the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdowns. The IEA’s analysis shows that targeting green jobs – such as retrofitting buildings to make them more energy efficient, putting up solar panels and constructing wind farms – is more effective than pouring money into the high-carbon economy. Sam Fankhauser, executive director of the Grantham Research Institute on climate change at the London School of Economics, who was not involved in the report, said: “Building efficiency ticks all the recovery boxes – shovel-ready, employment intensive, a high economic multiplier, and is absolutely key for zero carbon [as it is] a hard-to-treat sector, and has big social benefits, in the form of lower fuel bills.” He warned that governments must not try to “preserve existing jobs in formaldehyde” through furlough schemes and other efforts to keep people in employment, but provide retraining and other opportunities for people to “move into the jobs of the future”. Calls for a green recovery globally have now come from experts, economists, health professionals, educators, climate campaigners and politicians. While some governments are poised to take action – for instance, the EU has pledged to make its European green deal the centrepiece of its recovery – the money spent so far has tended to prop up the high-carbon economy. At least $33bn has been directed towards airlines, with few or no green strings attached, according to the campaigning group Transport and Environment. According to analyst company Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more than half a trillion dollars worldwide – $509bn – is to be poured into high-carbon industries, with no conditions to ensure they reduce their carbon output. Only about $12.3bn of the spending announced by late last month was set to go towards low-carbon industries, and a further $18.5bn into high-carbon industries provided they achieve climate targets. In the first tranches of spending, governments “had an excuse” for failing to funnel money to carbon-cutting industries, said Birol, because they were reacting to a sudden and unexpected crisis. “The first recovery plans were more aimed at creating firewalls round the economy,” he explained. But governments were still targeting high-carbon investment, Birol warned. He pointed to IEA research showing that by the end of May the amount invested in coal-fired power plants in Asia had accelerated compared with last year. “There are already signs of a rebound [in emissions],” he said. Climate campaigners called on ministers to heed the IEA report and set out green recovery plans. Jamie Peters, campaigns director at Friends of the Earth, said: “A post-Covid world must be a fair one. It will only be equitable if the government prioritises health, wellbeing and opportunity for all parts of society. As if the case was not compelling enough in a dangerously heating planet, it is even more urgent post-Covid.” Putting the IEA’s recommendations into action would boost the economy, added Rosie Rogers, head of green recovery at Greenpeace UK. “Government putting money behind sustainable solutions really is an economic no-brainer. It can see us build a recovery that both tackles the climate emergency and improves people’s lives through cleaner air and lower bills.” Investors were also keen to put private sector money into a green recovery, alongside government stimulus spending, said Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change, representing funds and asset managers with $26tn in assets. “The IEA has shown [a green recovery] is not only desirable, but economically astute. Investors are fully committed to playing their part in this process.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/nov/24/tuesday-briefing-joe-biden-transition-officially-begins","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-24T06:31:13Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Joe Biden transition officially begins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/24/tuesday-briefing-joe-biden-transition-officially-begins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/nov/24/tuesday-briefing-joe-biden-transition-officially-begins","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: Joe Biden transition officially begins","bodyText":"Top story: GSA agency opens coffers to new president Hello, Warren Murray here, and thanks for joining me again this Tuesday. Overnight, Donald Trump has stopped short of conceding the election as he begrudgingly endorsed the release of government resources for the Biden administration’s transition to power. Emily Murphy, who heads the General Services Administration (GSA), said she made the determination independently based on “the law” and “facts”. The move allows Joe Biden and his team to access classified briefings and meet with government officials. It also gives Biden officials access to office space and funds to pay the transition team. Swiftly after the announcement came a Trump tweet saying “our case STRONGLY continues” but “I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same”. Again, though – Murphy said she made that decision herself. Biden has started naming his cabinet, which includes Janet Yellen – the first woman to chair the US Federal Reserve – as the first female treasury secretary in US history. John Kerry, Obama-era secretary of state and onetime presidential hopeful, returns as as “climate tsar” while Jake Sullivan becomes national security adviser; Alejandro Mayorkas, who, if confirmed, would become the first Latino and migrant to be homeland security secretary; Avril Haines for director of national intelligence, who would be the first woman in that role; and Linda Thomas-Greenfield for ambassador to the United Nations. But wait, you say – what about the blinkin’ secretary of state? As widely foreshadowed his name is Antony Blinken, a Paris-schooled internationalist and foreign policy expert who has been at Joe Biden’s side for more than two decades. He served under Barack Obama as a deputy secretary of state, and on Bill Clinton’s national security council. As the administration takes shape, and much of the world indulges in the audacity of hope, Barack Obama has set out the challenges facing Biden in restoring global faith in American leadership. * * * Coronavirus latest – Oxford vaccine researchers have told how subjects who received a half-strength first dose, then a full second dose, developed immunity in 90% of cases, compared with 70% in subjects who received two full doses. The vaccine could be made available in the coming weeks in the UK if approved by regulators. Boris Johnson has set out a revised three-tier system of Covid restrictions for England to run until spring as he implored the public to make “one final push” before the expected arrival of vaccines and mass testing. It puts areas in England into one of three tiers once the four-week national lockdown across England ends on 2 December. With Johnson expected to detail plans to let households gather for Christmas, Labour is among those asking how the government will avert gridlocked roads and packed trains that risk further spreading of the virus. You can find more coronavirus developments at our global live blog. * * * Tory MPs meddling in justice, says top judge – The lord chief justice for England and Wales has admonished six Tory parliamentarians for seeking to influence a judge who is overseeing a hearing related to Charlie Elphicke, the MP jailed for sexual assault. The Tory MPs wrote to senior judges, copying in the judge who will oversee the hearing, which is about whether character witnesses written by some of them in support for Elphicke can be made public. Ben Yallop, private secretary to the lord chief justice, wrote that the MPs had sought to influence a judge “without regard for the separation of powers or the independence of the judiciary”. The Guardian, Times and Associated Newspapers are seeking release of the letters where the author is a public figure, in public office or holds or has held a position of public responsibility. * * * Opaque role of ‘clearing house’ – The government has been accused of operating an “Orwellian” unit known as the “clearing house” to obstruct the release of sensitive information under freedom of information (FOI). The little-known unit seeks to control the release of potentially embarrassing information, according to the openDemocracy group. The unit requires Whitehall departments to send it requests that are deemed to be potentially sensitive or too expensive to answer, and vets proposed responses. David Davis, the former Tory minister, said the clearing house goes against the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act “and probably the letter, too”. The government says the clearing house exists to ensure a standard approach to FOI requests, adding: “We must balance the public need to make information available with our duty to protect sensitive information and ensure national security.” * * * Volcano power – Geologists in New Zealand are hoping to reduce climate-damaging emissions by drilling deep into an extinct 11-million-year-old volcano below the city of Dunedin to harness its heat. They hope that heat from 500 metres down can be tapped to warm homes. In Britain the government plans to double the amount of renewable energy it will subsidise in 2021 after agreeing to include onshore wind and solar power projects for the first time since 2015. Energy companies will bid for subsidy contracts in an auction that could support up to 12GW of renewable energy – enough for up to 20m electric vehicles a year. Today in Focus podcast: Racism stalls Windrush restitution The Guardian’s Amelia Gentleman wrote her first story on the Windrush scandal almost three years ago – yet she is still hearing from people facing injustice. Alexandra Ankrah, the most senior black Home Office employee in the team responsible for the Windrush compensation scheme, discusses why she resigned this year, describing the scheme as systemically racist and unfit for purpose, while Samantha Cooper describes her frustrations with trying to access financial help. Lunchtime read: Wolf at the door “There’s a monument near Brora, 60 miles short of John o’Groats, that claims to mark the spot where the last wolf in Sutherland was killed. I pass it often in the car. The wolf, it says, was killed by the hunter Polson in or about the year 1700 … Did it really happen? Probably not,” writes Cal Flyn. “Still, whether Polson is to blame or not, there are no wild wolves left in Scotland. By 1700, they had also long been extirpated from England and from Wales.” In Europe, those that survived retreated to rare enclaves. On the continent today, patterns of farming and land use have been changing on a grand scale, as marginal land – too steep or too depleted – falls into disuse. Some estimate that in the three decades leading to 2030, an area the size of Italy will have been abandoned within the EU alone. As prey animals have crept back in, so have the carnivores – including the wolves. There are an estimated 12,000 wolves in Europe now, far more than in the contiguous US, and they have ranged back into populous countries like Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. With centuries-old fears raised once again, can wolf and humankind share the landscape? Sport Crowds of up to 4,000 people will be allowed to return to sporting events in England from next week, and grassroots sport will also resume as part of an easing of coronavirus restrictions announced by the prime minister. Theo Walcott scored his first goal since returning to Southampton but Pedro Neto grabbed a point for Wolves in a 1-1 draw at Molineux while Chris Wood’s early goal was enough for Burnley to beat Crystal Palace 1-0 at Turf Moor and move out of the bottom three. The England prop Kyle Sinckler has admitted that a mid-lockdown move to Bristol left him performing at just 20% of his ability but credited Eddie Jones’s faith in him for helping getting back to his best. The father of the 2008 Olympic road race champion, Nicole Cooke, raised concerns about alleged drug use in cycling with UK Anti-Doping and British Cycling that he felt were not acted on, a medical tribunal has been told. Joe Burrow, the No 1 overall pick in this year’s NFL draft, is set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines, according to reports. Pope Francis lauded a delegation of NBA players who met him at the Vatican on Monday as “champions” and said he supported their work on addressing social injustice. And the world’s best batsman, Steve Smith, has revealed a training breakthrough has him feeling like his old self at the crease on the eve of Australia’s ODI, T20 and Test series with India. Business The Nikkei index rose to its highest since May 1991 with most other Asia-Pacific markets also higher, though the Hang Seng and Shanghai have been flat or dipped slightly. Qantas has caused a stir with its CEO, Alan Joyce, foreshadowing that international travellers won’t be allowed on its planes without a coronavirus vaccine once it is widely available. The pound is worth $1.333 and €1.125 while the FTSE is headed for a rise of 0.37% at the open. The papers A quick flick through the print editions then. The Guardian leads with “UK vaccine ‘brings world step closer to ending Covid’”. The Telegraph picks up on the PM’s line that “Tis the season to be jolly careful” and the Metro and Express are more or less word for word in line with that, which will doubtless please the PRs at No 10. The Mail blends two themes with “Vaccine cheers … but first, the tiers”. The Times has “Covid curbs should be over by Easter, says medical chief”, which is when it is hoped the majority of vulnerable people will have been immunised. The Mirror has “Harsh winter … brighter spring”, highlighting that tiered restrictions are expected to affect more people between now and April. The FT has “Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine adds to armoury for Covid battle”. The Sun has a story about I’m a Celebrity.

In a world increasingly anxious about climate change, the surge in the generation of renewable energy over the past 20 years offers a sliver of hope. But the variable nature of wind and solar power means that storing energy until consumers need it has become the next big challenge. And so, large-scale battery installations are springing up across electricity grids around the world, to make them more flexible. In 2017, more than 1GW of power storage capacity was added around the world – a record, yes, but still a drop in the ocean of global energy demand. How do batteries like this work? Of course, we are not talking about a few AAA batteries here. And yet, all batteries broadly work in a similar manner. Electrical energy is converted to chemical energy when you charge a battery, and then the process is reversed when you draw power from it. There are three main constituents of most batteries: two electrodes and some form of chemical medium called the electrolyte, which can be a liquid, gel or solid. To generate electricity, a chemical reaction takes place that sees electrons move from the negative electrode, called the anode, to the positive electrode, called the cathode. When you charge the battery, the process is reversed, sending electrons back to the anode. So how many of these big batteries are there? There is around 500MW of large-scale battery power installed around the UK, a figure that is expected to double within three years, according to the analysts Aurora Energy Research. Almost all capacity uses lithium-ion. Globally installed power is expected to top 50GW by 2020 – and surge to almost 1,000GW by 2040, according to Bloomberg NEF. That would equate to about 7% of the world’s energy capacity. How do batteries fit in to the renewables revolution? In the UK, battery installations are primarily being deployed to supply services to National Grid. Such ancillary services are increasingly important to help match supply and demand as a growing amount of intermittent wind and solar power comes online. There are also the beginnings of “hybrid” renewable energy power plants, where batteries are installed alongside solar farms and windfarms. This is particularly important for the economics of solar farms, which can push down power prices around midday by peaking at the same time. Instead of exporting immediately, hybrid farms can store power to sell later at higher prices. In other parts of the world, such as South Australia, batteries are being used to make the grid more resilient and avoid blackouts. Crucially, batteries are not yet suitable and do not make economic sense for interseasonal storage – that is, storing up solar power in summer to release in winter. Will we all have big household batteries in the future? Elon Musk may have popularised the concept of a home battery when he unveiled Tesla’s version three years ago, but the firm was not the first and is not the biggest in this field. Such batteries, which are about the size of a gas boiler, can store and release electricity either generated by a household or imported from the grid. The German firm Sonnen, which has around a 25% global market share in home batteries, said most customers today are people who have solar panels or live in storm-hit regions and want a clean, reliable backup source of power. “The market is still in the very, very early phase,” says the chief executive, Christoph Ostermann. Germany, Italy, Australia and the US states of California and Hawaii are the biggest markets so far. For solar households, it makes more financial sense to store and consume the energy rather than be paid for exporting it to the grid. In future, as more time-of-use energy tariffs emerge, there might also be enough of an incentive to install one to avoid peak pricing. However, for Ostermann, the most exciting prospect is harnessing thousands of the batteries as a “virtual power plant”. He describes this as an “Uberisation” of batteries that the company does not own but can call on, with permission. “We are not heading for utility scale, but virtual power plants can provide significant power,” he says. What’s next for electric cars? We are just beginning to see the second generation of battery-powered vehicles, according to the entrepreneur Henrik Fisker, the founder of the electric car maker Fisker Inc. He views affordability and a decent range between charges as this crop’s defining features. While the first models, with the exception of Tesla, could manage around 100 miles, most new ones now offer between 200-300 miles. “I see the market starting to boom around 2020 or 2021, as there is more choice [of models],” says Fisker. Fisker also views ultrafast charging as vital to helping electric cars go mainstream. While a typical home will take about 8-10 hours to fully top up a car (with a 3KW socket), some new public chargers can do that in about 10 minutes (using a 350KW charger). What about other modes of transport? Electric double-decker buses, built by the Chinese manufacturer BYD, already ply the streets of London. Elon Musk has announced plans for an electric truck. But the energy density required for heavy transport makes it a lot harder for batteries to beat fossil fuels. “It’s definitely more challenging,” says Prof Paul Shearing, the Royal Academy of Engineering’s chair in emerging battery technologies. “[But] I think the future is going to be electric, no matter which way you cut it.” Will we all be flying around in electric jumbo jets soon? “Not yet,” says Shearing, who adds that energy density and weight of batteries meant there would probably only be used in unmanned aerial vehicles in the short term. “I think it’ll be a long time until we see an electric passenger plane,” he says. What is the environmental and social impact of making batteries? A key element in lithium-ion batteries is cobalt, despite manufacturers’ attempt to reduce the amount required. More than 60% world’s cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where concerns have been raised about the social and environmental impact of mining the metal. The lithium in the batteries comes mainly from three big producer countries, Australia, Argentina and Chile, along with emerging producers such as Bolivia, Brazil, Canada and Zimbabwe. Water consumption and scarcity in some producer countries is the big concern here. “There are definite ethics issues. Large companies are going to be driven by cost,” says Shearing, of cobalt and lithium production. What happens to the batteries towards the end of their life is also a big challenge. Dr Jonathan Radcliffe, of the school of chemical engineering at the University of Birmingham, is worried about the fate of batteries when their performance in today’s crop of electric vehicles is no longer good enough for cars. Some now have a second life as a home battery, but he fears the market could be saturated in a few years, undermining the financial case for reuse. “The risk is that there is no viable second-use in the UK and we have a large amount of battery waste, without the processes in place to deal with it,” he says. What limits capacity and battery life? The bigger and denser the battery, the more chemical energy it can store and therefore the more electricity it can generate. But a bigger, denser battery is more expensive, heavier, takes longer to charge and has more potential for destruction if things go wrong. The chemistry and internal construction of the battery also plays a role in how much energy it can store. Lithium-based batteries are popular because they have a relatively high energy-to-weight ratio and maintain their charge well when not in use. In most devices, battery life is a trade-off between physical size, design, energy density and safety, alongside the energy efficiency of the device it powers. What about phone batteries – why do they deteriorate as they get old? Most batteries can only maintain their full capacity for a finite time and number of charge and discharge cycles. The exact process of battery ageing is still a hot research topic, but there are several mechanisms at play that occur when the battery is used or stored. The most common is the build-up of material on the anode, which slowly gets deposited when the battery is used or stored. A similar oxidation can also occur on the cathode, while the active ingredients of the battery can react and degrade over time. A combination of these effects reduce the amount of lithium ions and active material available for storing electricity, therefore reducing maximum capacity. But the internal resistance of the battery can also increase as it ages, meaning its peak power output is lower, a process that causes issues in iPhones. What accelerates battery ageing? How a battery is used and stored can dramatically affect its ageing. For instance, batteries can be damaged by exposing them to extremes of temperature, which is more problematic for a car or similar than a smartphone. Rapid cycling of the battery also increases wear, particularly if the power demands on the battery are very high, as is the case with electric cars. Charging and using the battery to its extremes also accelerates ageing, such as charging batteries to their maximum and discharging them to zero. What happens when things go wrong? Safety was thrown into the spotlight when some of the batteries inside the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 developed a fault that caused them to short circuit and catch fire. When something disrupts the chemical reaction inside the battery, it can cause “thermal runaway”, where uncontrolled reactions chain together, generating too much heat, typically resulting in batteries bursting or catching fire. Various safety mechanisms, both electrical control circuits and physical measures including shielding and battery structure, mean such events are rare. But they are of particular concern for portable devices, which are often held on a person, and electric vehicles that may be involved in a collision that could damage the integrity of the battery. What next? Companies are working hard to increase the amount of energy that can be packed into a battery, and to bring down the cost of making them. Future prices are unlikely to fall as fast as they have in the past, says Ostermann, because reductions have already been so rapid. Sonnen has seen prices fall from more than €1,000 (£905) per kilowatt hour of energy capacity when it started in 2010, to about €150-200 per kWh today. But the company expects to cut costs in electronics such as inverters. New wonder materials will take a while to break through, Shearing says. “The next 10 years are going to continue to be lithium-ion dominated. It’s taken a long time to get to this productivity and technological maturity level. For anything to catch up will take a while.” Most innovation will be around lithium-ion, he believes, such as improving the energy density and lowering costs by reducing the amount of cobalt in a battery. The rate at which batteries can take on a charge will also improve, Shearing adds. Radcliffe agrees that lithium-ion will continue to dominate. Cost and performance will improve, driven by the scale-up of manufacturing and continued research, he says. Batteries will also be put to new uses. Fisker says that as technology improves, he expects to see them eventually appear on construction sites, in mines and in industrial equipment, replacing diesel generators. They will be deployed in increasingly small devices, such as medical implants, Shearing says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/oct/19/scottishpower-to-invest-in-solar-energy-for-the-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-19T15:19:11Z","webTitle":"Scottish Power to invest in solar energy for the first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/19/scottishpower-to-invest-in-solar-energy-for-the-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/oct/19/scottishpower-to-invest-in-solar-energy-for-the-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Scottish Power to invest in solar energy for the first time","bodyText":"Scottish Power, one of Britain’s biggest energy companies, has said it will invest in solar power for the first time as part of its move away from fossil fuels. The big six firm sold off its last gas-fired power stations to Drax Group this week to focus exclusively on renewables, which today consists of onshore and offshore windfarms. But Keith Anderson, the company’s chief executive, told the Guardian he had decided to move into solar, too. “The solar market has had difficulties over the last wee while. But you look at where the technology cost is getting to, and the possibilities of integrating it with wind … how it balances from season to season wind and solar output, and we see a good opportunity there for further investment.” Solar farms around the UK have historically been built by smaller energy firms and community groups, so the entrance of such a big player would mark a major shake-up. It could also inject life into a sector that has stalled in the face of subsidy cuts. Researchers have argued that the comparatively low wind output across Europe this summer because of hot, still weather was a reminder of why energy companies should be investing in solar as well as wind. Anderson said that Scottish Power had moved to 100% renewables because it was cheaper than other sources. “We need to invest in the cheapest forms of energy – that’s onshore wind, offshore wind, it’s going to be solar – and that will help drive down the cost of energy,” he said. The world’s need to tackle climate change also made it clear that companies needed to embrace green energy wholeheartedly, he said. “Look at the IPCC report last week. My absolute belief is that organisations need to be at the forefront of that change. We can’t be part of the problem, we have to be part of the solution.” Scottish Power would be competing in an auction next summer for a slice of £557m in government subsidies for offshore windfarms, Anderson confirmed. The firm hopes to secure a contract for its planned 1,200MW East Anglia Three project, which would be capable of powering nearly 900,000 homes and dwarf the world’s current biggest, a 659MW scheme off the Cumbrian coast. Anderson also expressed confidence that ministers were nearing a rethink on their block on subsidies for onshore windfarms, which the Conservatives barred when they came to power in 2015. “We’re closer than we’ve ever been before,” he said. A poll this week found that two thirds of people living in rural Scottish communities, which are considered to have some of the best sites for prospective sites, support onshore windfarms. But the prospect for new gas power stations – which companies including Drax and Germany’s RWE want to build – were bleak, Anderson said. “Right now the commercial signals don’t exist to build a new gas plant in the UK. That might change in the future, but it’s not something we’ll get involved in.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/jul/12/australia-news-live-covid-hospitalisations-anthony-albanese-sydney-energy-forum-pacific-islands-forum-fiji-kiribati-china-queensland-monkeypox","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-12T08:39:09Z","webTitle":"End of rapid Covid test and telehealth subsidies criticised – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/12/australia-news-live-covid-hospitalisations-anthony-albanese-sydney-energy-forum-pacific-islands-forum-fiji-kiribati-china-queensland-monkeypox","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/12/australia-news-live-covid-hospitalisations-anthony-albanese-sydney-energy-forum-pacific-islands-forum-fiji-kiribati-china-queensland-monkeypox","fields":{"headline":"End of rapid Covid test and telehealth subsidies criticised – as it happened","bodyText":"With that, we will wrap up the blog for the evening. We’ll be back first thing tomorrow, with all the latest from Fiji and closer to shore. Here are today’s major developments: With the Pacific Islands Forum underway, Australia has resisted calls from neighbours for no new gas or coal projects, saying it was not responsible for other countries’ emissions. In other forum news, the Australian and US governments have signed a deal they say will help accelerate zero emissions technology, including long duration storage and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The announcement was made by the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, and the US secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, on the sidelines of the Sydney Energy Forum. The federal health minister, Mark Butler, announced the federal program providing 10 free rapid antigen tests every three months for concession card holders will end in July. The opposition’s health spokeswoman, Anne Ruston, has called for the health advice underpinning the decision to be released. The announcement has been criticised by health bodies including the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia. Australia reported 58 Covid deaths on Tuesday, as both NSW and Victoria reduced the reinfection period from 12 down to four weeks. And Australia’s privacy watchdog has launched an investigation into retail giants Bunnings and Kmart over their use of facial recognition technology in stores. A gentle reminder we’re still in a pandemic: Man dies in Fitzroy in Melbourne A man has died in Fitzroy this afternoon after a fatal shooting occurred, Victoria Police say. Emergency services were called to Brunswick Street about 4.15pm this afternoon where the man was located with life threatening injuries. Police believe he was involved in an altercation with a number of people at a car parked on Brunswick Street before he was fatally shot. Witnesses called triple zero and ambulance crews tried to treat the man, who is yet to be formally identified, but he later died at the scene. Police have cordoned off the area and a crime scene has been established. Victoria police: Detectives are still working to determine the exact circumstances of the incident but at this stage it appears to be a targeted incident with the parties involved possibly known to each other. Police would like to speak anyone who witnessed anything or has CCTV or dashcam vision of the incident. Covid admissions up 53% in Victorian hospitals in past two weeks The Victorian government has released more information on today’s Covid update. Health authorities say there’s been a 53% increase in the numbers of Victorians in hospital with the virus in the past two weeks, as BA.4/BA.5 becomes the dominant strain circulating in the community. At the same time, the third wave of Omicron isn’t expected to peak until August. The Victorian government joined New South Wales in reducing the period of reinfection from 12 weeks to 28 days, and has pushed for Victorians to get their booster and wear masks in high risk settings. Case and hospitalisation trends are increasing in Victoria. This is in line with similar patterns globally and in other Australian jurisdictions, which have seen a significant rise in the number of people hospitalised with Covid-19 in recent weeks. What is GDP? Our latest News glossary video explains When a country’s economy is discussed in the news, you often hear a number called GDP, or gross domestic product, thrown around. But what does it actually mean, and is it gross? In this episode of News glossary, Matilda Boseley explains the meaning of GDP and how it reflects economies in Australia and abroad. PM defends the scrapping of pandemic leave payments Anthony Albanese has defended scrapping pandemic leave payments, laying the blame at the feet of the previous government, AAP reports. The payments for workers who needed to spend time away from work while they isolated ended on 30 June. But there have been calls for the payments to be reinstated as Covid case numbers and hospitalisations increase across the country, driven by new, infectious sub-variants. The prime minister, who today received his fourth Covid-19 vaccine dose, said he would not bring back the payments due to the need for the government to rein in spending. The new government had inherited the former’s decision to end the payments and $1tn of debt, he said: They are circumstances which my government faces … there are a range of things we would like to do, but we intend to be fiscally responsible in how we deal with issues. As case numbers rise across the country, the chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said hospitals could hold back some elective surgery due to the strain on the system. He said the emergence of influenza for the first time in three years in Australia was making the situation worse. The health minister, Mark Butler, said Covid cases were not likely to peak nationally for at least four weeks during the third wave of infections. While case numbers have increased and calls have grown for mask mandates to return, the prime minister said he would follow health advice on the issue. The epidemiologist Catherine Bennett told Sky News educating the public about the risks of exposure to Covid would be more helpful than reintroducing a mask mandate. Australia has resisted calls from the Pacific for no new gas or coal projects, saying it was not responsible for other countries’ emissions, in a move that could cause tensions as Pacific leaders meet in Suva this week. A key demand of Pacific nations – that Australia commit to no new coal or gas projects – will remain a point of difference between Australia and Pacific nations, as Anthony Albanese arrives in Fiji on Wednesday ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting. Labor late off the mark on foot-and-mouth disease, Littleproud says David Littleproud just appeared on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing to discuss the growing threat of foot-and-mouth disease. As if we didn’t need more things to worry about. Murray Watt, the federal minister for agriculture, has backed the expansion of electronic tagging to improve tracing of livestock to combat the risk of disease, but says it’s up to state governments to mandate it. Littleproud says he’s been too late off the mark. While I welcome the fact Murray’s going to Indonesia, we would have hoped probably last week he might have picked the phone up and tried to build on what we’d already put in place in Indonesia and Timor and Papua New Guinea. When this hit, we – not only with foot-and-mouth disease, but with lumpy skin disease – we put biosecurity officers and vets into those countries to try and ... help. What we’re concerned about is there’s no decisive action on some other measures that could be taken ... there are hundreds of people coming from Indonesia back into Australia every day. Anthony Albanese has the Australia-themed sportswear on but he’s missing the face mask flag. Throwback: Hydrogen project will need government support, energy forum hears In the closing panel of the Sydney Energy Forum, Yoshinori Kanehana of Kawasaki Heavy Industries says greater government support will be needed to progress the Japanese-Australian Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain project (HESC) – an engineering milestone that makes liquefied hydrogen from coal. HESC was “so successful because of the big support from the Japanese and Australian government”, he says. Under the $500m HESC pilot project, hydrogen will be made in Victoria’s LaTrobe valley from brown coal and transported aboard a purpose-built ship to Japan, where it will be burned in coal-fired power plants. Kanehana says: At the beginning, the cost [of liquid hydrogen] may be more expensive compared to fossil fuels ... So we need operating expense help from the government. Large, vast quantity production of hydrogen will reduce the cost. This cannot be done by a single company or single country. Some researchers have raised concerns that the project could increase emissions and lock in a new fossil fuel industry. Fiji’s PM urges Pacific unity but respects Kiribati withdrawal from forum In Suva, Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, says the Pacific is “most resilient as a family”, while respecting the wishes of Kiribati and its government to withdraw from the forum. The people and government of Kiribati have always been and will remain part of our Pacific family. Australia’s privacy watchdog has launched an investigation into retail giants Bunnings and Kmart over their use of facial recognition technology in stores. Consumer group Choice last month revealed Bunnings and Kmart were using the technology – which captures images of people’s faces from video cameras as a unique faceprint that is then stored and can be compared with other faceprints – in what the companies say is a move to protect customers and staff and reduce theft in selected stores. Choice reported the two companies along with the The Good Guys to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), raising questions over how people’s personal information was being handled through the technology. The OAIC announced on Tuesday it had decided to launch an investigation into the personal information handling practices of Bunnings and Kmart and how they use the facial recognition technology in store. The Good Guys paused its use of the technology following preliminary inquiries from the OAIC. The OAIC said: In line with the OAIC’s Privacy regulatory action policy, no further comment will be made while the investigations are ongoing. Comment has been sought from Bunnings and Kmart. Environment protection agency needed to help Australia ‘do better’, Plibersek says Finally, Plibersek is asked about the State of the Environment Report, to be released on 19 July and expected to be “grim reading”. The report was received by the previous government in December and not made public before the federal election. Question: What would a standalone environment protection agency, the likes of which you have promised, what would it do to improve any of the findings in that report and by when? Plibersek: This is a report that is months overdue ... the fact we’ve kept it secret before the last election tells you a lot about the contents of the report. I don’t want to disclose everything today. I will tell you that this report shows that there’s been a substantial decline in a number of key areas of our environment. We need to do better. We absolutely need to do better to protect our landscapes, our threatened species, to protect the environment for all Australians. We’ve spoken about an environmental protection agency because it’s a simple fact that the EPBC Act ... is not doing its job particularly well. It’s not protecting the environment in the best way and it’s also quite slow and cumbersome. Labor ‘determined’ to invest in shift to renewable despite global energy crisis Plibersek is asked whether a warning from the visiting International Energy Agency chief that the global energy crisis may get worse before it gets better could hinder the federal government’s 43% energy reduction commitment. She says Labor remains “determined” to invest in the transition to cleaner energy. I think it’s plain to everyone that the conflict in Ukraine and other uncertainties are having an impact on energy markets around the world but it doesn’t change the fact that particularly in the medium to longer term, the best way of bringing down power prices is to see more renewables entering the market. I think this is a reminder that this transition is a huge opportunity for Australia. Of course, it has short-term difficulties, and I’m not for a moment discounting the impact that higher energy prices right now are having. This is the result of 10 years of ... neglect by the previous government. Short term, then, is there a lot of “pressure placed on [her] shoulders” to approve new coal and gas projects? (Presumably as a sort of “band-aid fix” despite the fact coalmines take a reasonable amount of time to start up and shut down.) I don’t think any serious commentator is saying that we’ve got to stop exporting Australian coal and gas tomorrow. I don’t think anybody serious is saying that. It will be part of our energy mix for some time to come and part of the global energy mix for some time. What we need to do is make sure at the same time we develop the economic opportunities of renewable energy. Australia in talks with Pacific on 2029 UN climate conference, Plibersek says The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, follows Conroy on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing. Still on the Pacific Islands Forum, she’s asked how much thought the federal government has given to the 2029 UN climate conference and the involvement of smaller Pacific nations. Plibersek says: We’ve started to have conversations with our Pacific neighbours about the sort of involvement they’d like to see. I met with the Samoan environment minister today, and last week when I was in Lisbon I met with a number of Pacific leaders and ambassadors from Pacific nations, and there’s a fair degree of enthusiasm for this proposal. Obviously no region in the world is more impacted by climate change than the Pacific. So, there’s a very strong interest from Pacific nations to remind the world again of what an existential issue this is for them. Australia is supporting Vanuatu’s voice on climate, Conroy says Conroy is asked about the push from Vanuatu for the international court of justice (ICJ) to seek referrals on countries that don’t meet their climate change obligations. No Pacific island nation is a party to the ICJ, yet Conroy has indicated he’s in support of the proposal. Is Australia “backing the wrong horse”? We’re backing a process. We’re being very supportive of the Vanuatu government’s efforts to get a resolution passed by the UN general assembly, that would refer a number of questions to the international court of justice for their deliberations ... we make it clear that the UNFCCC negotiations is the primary focus for achieving climate action around the globe but are supportive of the process that Vanuatu has been pursuing ... we haven’t agreed on the resolution. We’re yet to see the questions that the government of Vanuatu intends to put to the UN general assembly and we will reserve our position until we see the questions, like every other nation. This is just an example of where under the new Australian government rather than stifling climate action, rather than trying to bully and intimidate Pacific countries to stop them talking about climate action, we’re supporting their voice in multilateral forums because is the number one security threat to the Pacific and we’re very committed to being part of the solution, rather than being part of the problem. Pacific Islands Forum focused on ‘rebuilding unity’, Conroy says Now to China, “looming large” over discussions at the forum. Conroy: We made a decision to not include dialogue partners in this PIF, but the focus was on concentrating on rebuilding PIF unity. So that’s why the vast majority of the program with limited exceptions ... focused on Pacific Island Forum leaders and foreign ministers talking to each other, working on how we can renew and energise the PIF architecture. Why, then, did the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, make a pitch to members? There are some limited and specific interventions that the chair has allowed. And obviously that was a decision that the prime minister of Fiji made. So you have to go to the Fiji government as to why they did that. There are limited exceptions to that focus. The overwhelming focus is on rebuilding unity. Australia’s aid to Kiribati has no strings attached, Conroy says Asked what more Australia could do to entice Kiribati back, Conroy acknowledged it was “important that the discussions are being led by Fiji” as the chair of the Pacific Islands Forum. Yesterday, Australia committed $2m in additional assistance to help the island nation through drought. It’s counter productive for Australia to be too forward leaning. That decision around the aid package is not conditional on Kiribati rejoining the Pacific Islands Forum. We don’t deliver aid like that. We don’t deliver aid with strings attached, unlike other countries interested in this region. Pacific minister Pat Conroy on Kiribati rejoining the Pacific Islands Forum Pacific minister Pat Conroy is appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, wearing a lovely shirt. Asked whether Kiribati may rejoin the Pacific Islands Forum, he replied: The leaders’ dialogue had a lot of strong language around commitment to unity and the importance of a strong united Pacific voice. That is a positive. Importantly, several Micronesian leaders were strong in the need to implement the Suva agreement and rebuild the architecture of the Pacific Islands Forum as the central architecture for the region. I wouldn’t say that I’m more optimistic about Kiribati rejoining. I’m not more pessimistic, but I think it’s one where we have to let Kiribati go through their paces, acknowledging today is their national day ... Pacific unity is vital for our shared interests. That’s what Micronesian leaders said ... and something we’re working towards. Controversial Queensland New Acland coalmine should stay closed, activists say My thought has well and truly been provoked by this Fijian cloud. On the topic of climate change, the Queensland Resources Council is lobbying the state government to expand a controversial New Acland open-cut coalmine, which would extract some seven million tonnes of coal per year and extend its life for more than a decade. Paul King from Oakey Coal Action Alliance said the mine was currently closed and should stay that way. This controversial mine expansion will risk prime agricultural land and water resources and goes against the science that tells us emissions must rapidly decrease to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. During our current food crisis, it doesn’t make sense to destroy prime agricultural land and put up to 10m litres of milk production at risk by reopening this mine. The new mining project will also use up to 1.3m litres of water a day, draining local water bores. Farmers in this area are completely reliant on this groundwater source. Local farmers and landholders are calling on the government to reject this licence and put an end to this dangerous project once and for all. RACGP backs continuation of free RATs for concession card holders The RACGP is backing the continuation of free rapid antigen tests for concession card holders following the federal government’s announcement the funding would be cut. It comes amid the rollback of other Covid measures including 70 telehealth items introduced during the pandemic. Its president Karen Price says Covid “is not disappearing anytime soon” and we “must do more to reduce community transmission”. Government urged to consider shared infrastructure at Sydney Energy Forum Amanda Lacaze of Lynas has pleaded to the government to think about shared infrastructure between critical mineral and battery production at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Shared infrastructure is by definition going to be lower cost. My plead to the government is to think about shared infrastructure for these value-add activities. In Kalgoorlie, Western Australia – home to a Lyans mineral refining facility – it is “about water”, she explains. At the same time, it is “equally about minerals, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid ... it is about building the ecosystem and the capability”. If we do that, we can win ... [it] allows us to be cross-competitive. Spike in solar panel prices puts pressure on increased demand Prof Martin Green of UNSW acknowledges a spike in solar panel prices at the Sydney Energy Forum. Solar panel prices “hit an all time low in 2020”, he explains. Following a shortage in pure silicon material used in production following disturbances at three major factories, prices have “gone up about 40% per watt per solar panel”. With the “important role of solar” for climate change mitigation being increasingly “publicised”, Green points to “increased demand right at the time supply is struggling”. Disgraced former Ipswich mayor’s name stripped from bridge and street signs Ipswich mayor Teresa Harding says “common sense” has “prevailed” after the council voted to strip the name of jailed sex offender and former mayor Paul Pisasale from a bridge and street west of Brisbane. Pisasale was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison in 2020 after pleading guilty to more than 30 offences. Seven of nine councillors voted to remove Pisasale’s name from the council assets on Tuesday after a decision to leave the names unchanged sparked community backlash earlier this month. Pisasale’s former deputy mayor, councillor Paul Tully, and another fellow member of the former council, councillor Sheila Ireland abstained from the vote. On Facebook, Harding thanked residents for relaying their concerns and said their voices had “been heard loud and clear”. The council has authorised its chief executive to work with the Yuggera Ugarapul people native title holders to come up with new names in line with community sentiment. A council spokesperson said in the meantime, the bridge will be unnamed and street signs with the existing name at Yamanto will remain in place. The opposition’s health spokeswoman, Anne Ruston, has called on the federal government to release the health advice underpinning its decision to end free Covid tests for concession card holders. She raised concern that this followed a government decision to end more than 70 different telehealth services, and the winding up of pandemic leave payments despite Australia entering into a devastating third wave of the virus. She told Guardian Australia: At a time when we are seeing a massive increase in the number of Covid cases and cost of living pressures impacting very seriously on Australians, Mr Butler must outline what expert advice has formed the basis of his decision. The pattern of behaviour in the Albanese government’s health response to Covid is worrying. There have already been cuts to 70 telehealth services, cuts to the pandemic leave disaster payments, and now cuts to the access of rapid antigen testing for concession card holders. You would have to question the timing of these cuts when it is so important that Australians are mindful of this new, dangerous wave of Covid going through our communities. Queensland monkeypox case poses ‘no general risk’ In better news, a monkeypox case reported in Queensland yesterday evening – the state’s first – poses “no general risk” and no sleep lost. Which is a relief, as there are already enough things to stay up fretting over. Number of Queensland health staff off work equal to state’s first Covid wave The number of health staff off work in Queensland is nearly equal to the state’s first wave earlier in the year. Nevertheless, there’s been no move on a tightening of restrictions, with the chief health officer acknowledging keeping Covid off cruise ships is “incredibly difficult” following a major outbreak. The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia [PSA] national president Dr Fei Sim said the federal government’s announcement that the Covid-19 rapid test concessional access program will not be extended beyond July will put vulnerable Australians at risk. She said it also sends the wrong message to the public: The pandemic is not over, and the threat of serious illness is still there for many vulnerable people in our communities. Testing remains a vital part of our Covid-19 response. While recognising that our approach to test-trace-isolate has changed since the program was launched in January, testing with even mild symptoms remains an expectation of everyone in the community. She said with most states and territories adopting advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee [AHPPC] to move from a three-month to a 28-day immunity period, access to testing will be vital, especially for vulnerable groups who’ve relied on the concessional program. Earlier on Tuesday the Australian Medical Association [AMA] and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners [RACGP] said vulnerable people will be most impacted by the end of Medicare-subsidised extended telehealth consultations and a range of other telehealth items. Both organisations have written to health minister Mark Butler urging him to meet with them and discuss the changes. AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid has said: These changes undermine the ability of patients to access their doctors, and in particular for GPs to prescribe antivirals for Covid-positive patients and will lead to costs elsewhere in the health system, including in overstretched hospitals. This decision means telephone access to doctors will be significantly limited, hitting vulnerable patients hardest, including those who do not have access to high bandwidth internet and those who can’t operate the necessary IT systems. Many thanks to the lovely Natasha May for keeping us informed today. I’ll be with you for the rest of this fine Tuesday. Handing you over to the wonderful Caitlin Cassidy who’ll be helming the blog for the rest of the day! Sydney Energy Forum hears how Taiwan has no oil and gas Naiwen Marina Hsu of the Taiwanese branch of a fund management company specialising in energy infrastructure assets, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, told the panel at the Sydney Energy Forum today how Taiwan has “no oil and gas, at all”. In “looking to build out renewable energy”, the Chinese government has declared a net zero goal, she says. In response, “the buildout [of renewable energy manufacturing] has to be much more aggressive”. From zero to one [Taiwan] is building an offshore wind industry. 25km off the coast of Taiwan, commercialised offshore wind turbines are being constructed. [The Chinese government] just launched three rounds to build out to 15GW of offshore wind. A steady and a planned, staged policy department, together with capable private capital going in ... [and] experienced developers giving back to society by building up local industry. Emergency service volunteers being trained to fill Victoria’s ambulance staff shortage Fifty of Victoria’s fire and emergency service volunteers are being trained to provide first aid as the state’s ambulance staff are in extreme shortage. The training comes as Ambulance Victoria on Sunday issued its seventh code red emergency in as many months. Queensland energy minister calls for Australia to think about value rather than cost when it comes to renewables Mick de Brenni, the Queensland minister for energy, renewables and hydrogen, emphasises thinking about spending on renewable energy as “about value ... not about cost” on a panel at the Sydney Energy Forum. Value when looking at the cost of what we need to build includes consideration of reliability, quality, deliverability ... valuing the supply chains, the new business and job opportunities we create. Value means measuring the opportunity cost of not acting to develop your own capacity. It is a real threat ... if we are pushing for just low cost. De Brenni says this was the “shift” in the Queendsland government’s mindset when “thinking about investments” in renewables. NSW flood recovery and clean-up continues Agencies continue to help flood victims clean up their homes and streets. Fire and Rescue NSW said that fire crews have been cleaning up seaweed piled up in backyards at Chittaway Bay, on the Central Coast, in addition to the more usual activities of mopping up water, hosing out silt and moving ruined furniture from flood-damaged homes. At Sackville, on the Hawkesbury River, the agency has deployed its Hytrans Bulk Water Transfer unit to help pump large quantities of water out of affected areas. They’ve released a video showing some of these efforts. Agency running NDIS doesn’t understand First Nations cultural practices, inquiry hears The agency running the National Disability Insurance Scheme doesn’t understand the importance of Return to Country cultural practices to First Nations people, an inquiry has heard. The disability royal commission is this week exploring the experiences of First Nations people navigating the NDIS in remote communities over five days of hearings in Alice Springs. Beth Walker, the Northern Territory public guardian, told the inquiry the agency failed to understand the significance of Return to Country trips and did not include a specific line item for funding them in NDIS packages. She said: The NDIA doesn’t really get the importance of those Return to Country trips. They are viewed a little bit like a holiday rather than a cultural connection. That’s really important to First Nations people. And, again, there’s no specific line item in the NDIA pricing guide that covers Return to Country trips and so we are often trying to manoeuvre around people’s day to day services and pull out little bits or use other areas to fund the Return to Country trip. Walker said the logistics of planning such trips could be “extensive” because of a person’s disability needs, including mobility issues and the need for one or multiple support workers. So they are not necessarily easy things to plan, depending on the needs of the person. But the benefit and the joy that you see on someone’s face of returning and being with family is – there’s really no words to describe that. Walker also said she was concerned by cuts to the NDIS plans of some of the individuals for whom she acts as public guardian. Guardian Australia has previously reported cuts to funding packages in the NT, particularly for accomodation funding. She said: I think what I am seeing as public guardian is the winding back of people’s plans and it seems to have a financial driver rather than the needs of the person at the centre of what’s happening. And that really concerns me. Walker is the guardian for 337 First Nations people in the NT, 203 of whom living in remote communities. The inquiry continues. PM gets fourth Covid vaccine jab The prime minister Anthony Albanese rolled up his sleeve today for a fourth dose of the Covid-19 vaccine before he departs for Fiji to attend the Pacific Islands Forum. Albanese is part of the over 50 age bracket that Atagi recommended receive an additional dose of the vaccine last week, as hospitalisations surge across the country amid another Omicron wave. Since yesterday Australians over the age of 30 have been eligible for the extra jab. Climate action must be ‘fairly shared’ across Indo-Pacific, Bowen says Chris Bowen, minister for climate change and energy, urges the Indo-Pacific region could “lead the world in clean energy transformations” in his address to the Sydney Energy Forum. Pointing to battery, steal, hydrogen and solar manufacturing, Bowen says the region “can become the key global source of the raw materials, products and technologies that are vital to reducing emissions”. Australia is the biggest producer of lithium in the world, with 49% of global production in 2020. With battery demand expected to grow at an incredible rate over the next decade, Australia can seize the opportunity to become a critical mineral powerhouse ... Japan is setting the foundations for new clean energy supply chains in our region, investing significantly in hydrogen production, use and transport technologies. Japan and the Indo-Pacific are leading the world in hydrogen ... and ... India is on the path to becoming a solar giant, underpinned by the scale of their manufacturing sector, and spurred on by their ambitious target of reaching 100 GW of solar this year. Acknowledging the frequency and severity of both fires and floods sweeping Australia, Bowen says action on climate is both an “environmental obligation” and “in our region’s own economic interest”. It is also vital that no one is left behind. Bowen urges that the economic costs and benefits of “real action” on climate change must be “fairly shared” across the Indo-Pacific. We need to work with the leaders of emerging economies to understand and address their concerns. Bowen points to the Albanese government’s $15bn National Reconstruction Fund, aimed to “harness Australia’s renewable potential”. It will focus on production of green, low-cost materials for wind turbines and solar PV, as well as the broader economy ... [and] strengthen emerging sectors such as hydrogen and battery production, supported by hydrogen hubs and an Australian Made Battery Precinct. Bowen’s address comes as Australia signs a deal with the US to accelerate deployment of zero emissions technology, as covered by Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editor Adam Morton in the blog. First Nations people lobby to change culturally insensitive name of Queensland creek In Queensland, the Iningai and Bidjara people have successfully lobbied to change the name of Longreach’s Black Gin creek, deemed culturally insensitive to traditional owners. Bidjara man Trevor Robinson is lobbying to change the name to Watyakan, an Iningai word meaning women’s creek. In my view, not only is the current name intolerable to First Nations people but also to the wider community, especially women. State resources minister Scott Stewart said there was strong support for the name change from local council. This creek is a site of cultural importance to the traditional owners and custodians of the land and the current name does not give the site the respect it deserves. The ... government will continue to work with First Nations peoples to formally rename insensitive sites. The existing name first appeared on maps from about 1887 and covers the watercourse as it journeys from south-east of Ilfracombe to the Thompson River. Consultation with community on the name change will run until September. Australia must ‘walk the talk’ on climate, Greens leader says The Greens are pushing for the federal government to can new coal and gas projects as the Pacific Forum gets underway. Greens leader Adam Bandt said Australia must “walk the talk” on climate to bolster its position in the region. If we don’t change course ... big talk will mean nothing to our regional neighbours. We’ve promised our partners in the region that we’ll act to keep warming under 1.5 degrees, but Labor’s current climate target will make that impossible. A weak emissions reduction of 43% is consistent with at least two degrees of warming. Even the weak target of 43% by 2030 will be impossible if Labor doesn’t urgently halt new gas projects at Scarborough and the Beetaloo Basin. Pacific Island leaders want 75% and no new coal and gas because that’s what it takes to keep warming under 1.5 degrees. They’re not alone: According to applications lodged under national environment laws, the federal government could face decisions on whether to approve up to 27 coal mining developments. The RBA has released a nifty little snapshot of Australia’s economy. Millennials, avert your eyes at the average price of residential dwellings. The Australian and US governments have signed a deal that they say will help accelerate the development and deployment of zero emissions technology, including long duration storage and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The announcement by Australia’s climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, and the US secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, was made on the sidelines of the Sydney Energy Forum, covered elsewhere in the blog by Rafqa Touma. Few details of agreement were released, but Bowen said it would put dealing with climate change at the centre of the relationship between the countries. Both ministers suggested it should ultimately make the two countries less reliant on Chinese clean energy supply chains. The Chinese control about 80% of the global manufacturing supply chain for solar energy. Granholm said the two countries would “work together to unlock critical advances in long-duration storage, grid integration, clean hydrogen, direct air capture, and critical minerals and materials.” Bowen said the partnership was “a huge milestone in ramping up the US and Australia’s shared commitment to ambitious climate action and energy security”. It prioritises not just development but deployment of the critical technologies that will underpin economic opportunity in the energy transformation of our two countries. The announcement of the Australia-US net zero technology acceleration partnership coincided with the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the CSIRO and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory to work together developing clean energy tech. New canine member added to Queensland fire and rescue squad With the many recent natural disasters, Australia’s emergency services are more vital than ever. Fire and Rescue Queensland earlier today introduced the public to Bolt, their smallest qualified urban search and rescue canine. The South Australian police made an April fools’ joke last year claiming to be introducing sausage dogs into its ranks, but Bolt appears to be a legitimate member of the Queensland service. Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 58 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 1,174 In hospital: 140 (with 3 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 20 Cases: 10,806 In hospital: 2,049 (with 58 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 0 Cases: 481 In hospital: 39 (with no people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 15 Cases: 6,768 In hospital: 860 (with 12 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 3,668 In hospital: 246 (with 6 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 1,812 In hospital: 29 (with 2 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 16 Cases: 10,627 In hospital: 737 (with 39 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 6,000 In hospital: 297 (with 6 people in ICU) There were 6,000 new cases in the last reporting period, and six people are in intensive care. Calls for move to greater electricity use at Sydney Energy Forum Claudio Facchin of Hitachi Energy, urges the need to move “move 20% to 50-70% electricity” in the grid on a panel at today’s Sydney Energy Forum. He says there is comfort in “a lot of the technology needed to make that shift” being “available today” and there being “a lot of electrification across industries” on the “demand side”. Facchin says “we need do more to make everyone understand that the entire electricity system” will need to change. The scale that is needed and the pace at which we need to deliver that technology ... requires a lot of innovation. Facchin points to that innovation in “how we partner, look at business models, how we innovate across the entire supply chain, how we create policies and a regulatory environment to deploy this technology [across countries and regionally].” There were 3,668 new cases in the last reporting period, and six people are in intensive care. India’s energy supply chain discussed at Sydney Energy Forum Sumant Sinha of ReNew Power acknowledges the issues that come with India’s growth on a panel at today’s Sydney Energy Forum. As India grows, inevitably energy consumption will continue to grow. 70% of India’s total power comes from the coal sector, with 10% from renewables, Sinha explains. A lot of the power sector still sits in the hands of government controlled entities. How policy making evolves in a sector that moves very rapidly ... is a challenge. Following on from discussion earlier this morning on China’s monopoly over the solar panel manufacturing market, Sinha says “we cannot keep importing solar panels”, urging away from dependence on “another part of the world”. India has to create manufacturing domestically. There were 1,174 new cases in the last reporting period, and three people are in intensive care. First images from Nasa’s James Webb space telescope reveal ancient galaxies Nasa today released an image showing the deepest glimpse into the universe we’ve ever seen. It’s the first image from the James Webb telescope, the most powerful telescope ever put into space. The image shows a cluster of some of the earliest formed galaxies after the big bang 13.8bn years ago. On China’s monopoly of solar power manufacturing And an audience question brings us back to the topic of China’s monopoly on solar power manufacturing at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Sumant Sinha of ReNew Power explains China’s manufacturing advantage of companies’ access to cheaper land, and capitol cost being a bit lower. He says the “ecosystem you build” around manufacturing of solar panels – from glass panels to glue – is key to “bringing down logistic costs”. All of that gives you a significant competitive advantage. China crossed that quite some time ago. Any country that wants to start has to start from zero. That manufacturing ecosystem “needs to get to scale before you get to a comparative end product”. Sinha warns of a 25-35% cost disadvantage for a new country entering the market. Will people be willing to pay more to support a new country manufacturing [to diversify away from China]? This is difficult ... because people want access to the cheapest power. Hydrogen could step in to reduce reliance on gas, CSIRO boss says Malcolm Turnbull, former prime minister of Australia, puts forward a question about long duration energy storage at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Dr Larry Marshall of CSIRO says, to address that question, “we need to go beyond the grid”. We need fuel to transfer massive amounts of energy quickly. Marshall warns of an expectation that a reliance on gas will persist until 2040. But he is optimistic that hydrogen will emerge as the solution. Hydrogen will be able to step in and fill in the gap to reduce the amount of storage needed. Equivalent to Europe’s use of hydro electric and nuclear energy, “we think we can do ... with hydrogen in Australia”. There were 6,768 new cases in the last reporting period, and 12 people are in intensive care. Australia needs ‘innovation’ to make clean energy transition Dr Larry Marshall of CSIRO says “innovation is key” in the transition to clean energy technologies on a panel at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Our biggest problem [in Australia] is our innovation dilemma. We can’t make this massive transition, bigger than anything any of us have ever lived through, if we can’t fix that. ‘Huge opportunity’ for Australia to cooperate with US on defence, Marles says Earlier, at the Centre for Strategic International Studies the defence minister Richard Marles also spoke about the possibility of greater development cooperation with the United States. Marles said development was an aspect of the US-Australia alliance that is “underdone” because there “is not the same deep, organic interoperability as in other areas such as defence”. To be glass half full about it – there’s huge opportunity to develop this and do more. Marles then gave an extended analogy about how US naval patrols around its territories including Hawaii traversed the exclusive economic zones of other countries, and could alert them to illegal fishing from “grey” vessels “pillaging” their fish. He proposed an audit of existing activities in the Pacific to determine how these could help Pacific neighbours. Bridi Rice, the chief executive of Development Intelligence Lab, said: The Australia-US alliance is missing a critical dimension for security and stability in the Pacific – development. It’s about time we heard a defence leader talking about development challenges of our region and as a serious and valuable space for US-Australian cooperation. While the political commitment to US and Australian development cooperation in the Pacific has ramped up, we fall woefully short when it comes to practice. We don’t have shared assessments, joint cooperation on the ground is scarce. That has got to change if we are going to have an effective alliance in the Pacific. Update on the second day of hearings held by the disability royal commission in Alice Springs focused on NDIS for First Nations people A First Nations woman with disability living has told of a lack of support in Tennant Creek, saying her life has become more difficult since the national disability insurance scheme arrived in town. Emily, who grew up in Mount Isa, Queensland, but now lives in the Northern Territory, had a stroke in her twenties in 2003 that left her unable to speak. She told the disability royal commission she uses an electric scooter to get around, but that her front door was too small to bring it inside. This meant she needed to charge the scooter outside by running a cable through a window. She said she was concerned her scooter would be stolen, as had occurred to others in the town. Emily also said she had an NDIS plan but that no one had told her how to use her funds. There is no NDIS office in Tennant Creek, meaning she needs to go to a Centrelink office to discuss NDIS issues. That office is not wheelchair accessible, so she can only enter using a walking stick. When asked by counsel assisting the commission, Avelina Tarrago, whether things had gotten worse since the NDIS started, Emily agreed that they had. The commission was also played a clip of Emily crossing the Barkly Highway, the main road in Tennant Creek. Emily said she was often scared crossing the bumpy road on her scooter because there were many trucks which tended to speed along the highway. Her scooter’s tyres were easily damaged on the rough terrain. The inquiry is this week investigating the experiences of First Nations people in remote communities in accessing the NDIS. Minister defied advice on mask mandates Victoria’s health minister Mary-Anne Thomas has revealed the state government defied the acting chief health officer’s advice to introduce mask mandates in a range of settings including early childhood education and some retail environments. It comes after the Victorian government last week extended the state’s pandemic declaration for another three months, citing a serious Covid risk to the public. Speaking to reporters, Thomas said the government had consulted with industry groups and other stakeholders in making its decision: We want to empower Victorians to make the best decision. Victoria today joined NSW in reducing the state’s Covid reinfection period to four weeks, as the state government recommends people wear masks indoors and in crowded public places. Covid-carrying cruise ship under watchful eye of NSW Health When the Coral Princess cruise ship – carrying over 100 Covid positive cases – arrives in NSW the crew will not be allowed to disembark and passengers will have to return a negative RAT test, NSW Health authorities say: The vast majority of Covid-19 cases on the ship are currently in crew members. A small number of passengers have been diagnosed with Covid-19 since boarding the Coral Princess, their infections were most likely acquired prior to boarding and they subsequently tested positive. The ship is currently en route to the port of Eden on the South Coast of NSW and is also scheduled to be in Sydney for one day on Wednesday, 13 July, before travelling to Brisbane. NSW Health said it is liaising with the Coral Princess cruise ship to monitor the health of its passengers and crew members: NSW Health’s assessment is that the Covid-19 risk level for the Coral Princess during this cruise is amber, which indicates a moderate impact to the vessel. When the ship arrives at the port of Eden, NSW Health says that no crew members will disembark and all passengers disembarking will be requested to return a negative RAT result first: To further minimise the risk of transmission, passengers on shore tours will also be advised to wear masks when on transport or in other public indoor spaces, physically distance wherever possible and to regularly use hand sanitiser. ‘I want a frank, fair-dinkum review’: Perrottet on flooding Albanese and Perrottet are speaking about the future of flood-prone areas like Lismore and whether rebuilding should occur. Albanese said: I don’t think we’ve had a discussion about relocating the whole of Lismore. But what we have had on a pretty informal basis is discussion about planning. I think we’d have a common view that you can’t continue to commit the same issues and wonder why you get the same outcomes. And quite clearly planning and development in flood planes is something that is primarily the responsibility of state governments, but common sense has got to apply here as well and I’m confident that the premier will be doing just that. Perrottet said he agreed with the principle that you can’t keep doing the same things the same way and expect a different outcome: There’s no doubt these events are becoming more prevalent and I have commissioned that review. I expect to receive that review by the end of the month. I have said that I’ll make that review public. Now, a lot of that will focus on the immediate response to these disasters but there’s no doubt there will be a medium- to long-term focus and our government is already, independently of that review, working through how we plan for the long term. We need to make sure that we can stand here as leaders in a circumstance where an event like this happens in the future – which it inevitably will – that we have done everything we can to make sure we don’t make the mistakes of the past. And whether that’s development on flood plains in circumstances where not only does that cost and risk lives, but the impact on properties, homes, and businesses, which the Government, at a Commonwealth and state level will always be there to provide that financial support. That’s our job. I have said to both Mary O’Kane and Mick Fuller in relation to that review that I don’t want a political review. I want a frank, fair-dinkum review, that the government will take on board and respond. And I’ll make that report public as quickly as possible. I’ll await the legislation, says PM on assisted dying Albanese is asked how he would vote on the issue of assisted dying: We haven’t seen the bill yet. It will be a private member’s bill. I’ll look at the details of the bill. I’ve been on the record previously - I was an opponent of the Andrews bill when it occurred. The Labor Party has a conscience vote on these issues and so I’ll await the legislation that I read is being introduced by Luke Gosling from the Northern Territory and Alicia Payne from the ACT. Albanese says there are two issues at play: The issue of substance and also the issue of the right of territory governments to be able to determine their own legislation as well. That’s something that, in my view, people in Australia should not be treated any differently and with less rights if they happen to live in Canberra compared with living in Queanbeyan in the state of New South Wales, and similar issues apply to the Northern Territory. Throw out your thongs, say farmers AAP reports that farmers are urging travellers from Bali to throw out their thongs before arriving in Australia, to help stop the highly contagious foot and mouth disease. It’s been estimated the arrival of FMD in Australia could cost the agriculture industry $80b. National farmers federation president Fiona Simson said people throwing away their old footwear would be given a voucher towards a new pair of shoes. “Ringers Western will give them a 30% voucher on their return,” she said. “I never thought we’d be helping people buy new shoes to keep my cattle safe, but here we are.” Last week, biosecurity measures were strengthened at Australian airports. Detector dogs are operating at Darwin and Cairns airports and biosecurity officers are boarding flights from Indonesia to do checks of travellers arriving from Indonesia. – with AAP NSW flood relief payments being fast-tracked: PM The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is emphasising the payments are being fast-tracked to prioritise support for victims over auditing the process. However, both he and the premier are imploring people to only apply if they are eligible: The costs so far to the commonwealth has been $514m , so this joint funding is separate from that as well. I make this point – we’re making the payments. We’re not holding them up in order to audit in advance. But we will be auditing in retrospect as well. So only people who are eligible for these payments should apply for these payments, but we didn’t want to be in a circumstance whereby people were not able to receive support because some of these people have lost everything. So the idea that you can go through and check every application before payments are made would have had a severe impact on people and would have added to the trauma which people are experiencing. Perrottet has affirmed the audit will be performed in due course and any false claims will be identified: Whether it’s through Covid payments or disaster payments, there are always people who fraudulently put registrations and applications in who are not eligible and that is disgraceful. If you do that, we will catch you out ... But from a state and Commonwealth perspective, it is most important right now that we provide that assistance as quickly as possible to those who need it and, as the Prime Minister has said, significant audits will be in place following this period. Further flood support details NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, is providing more details on what the additional funding will go towards: Today, we’re announcing significant financial assistance for those impacted by these recent floods and it’s a joint initiative with the commonwealth government. This includes grants to councils that will help with things like urgent repairs to infrastructure and helping them employ additional people to help with the flood recovery. In addition to that, we’ve committed funding for the clean-up, primary producer and small business grants and boots on the ground to assess... the recovery process. We’re at the start of the recovery and our two governments will make the necessary financial commitments to get these communities back on their feet as soon as possible. Flood support extended to eight further LGAs Murray Watt, the federal minister for emergency management, has announced an additional eight local government areas will receive support. We’re also pleased to announce today that we’ve extended that support to a further eight local government areas in addition to the 29 that had been previously announced. So there’s now a total of 37. The extra eight LGAs are Cumberland, mid-Coast, Muswellbrook, Nambucca, Newcastle, Port Stephens, Randwick and Warren, a total of 37 LGAs around New South Wales that will be eligible for those payments and they will also be eligible for the payments that have been announced by the Prime Minister and the Premier today. Perrottet pledges grants, $1m of flood support per council NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet says the additional supports will be available by the end of the week: The assistance that we’re announcing today ... will be available for registration by the end of the week through Service New South Wales for the business grant of up to $50,000. The primary producer grant, through the rural assistance authority of up to $75,000. With regards the council grants: This financial support today of $1m per council impacted is in addition to that financial support that we have provided in the past and we’ll continue to work with our local government areas right across the state to ensure they have the financial support they need to get their communities back on track as quickly as possible. Prime minister Anthony Albanese is announcing additional funding to support flood victims in NSW to help get people’s lives “back on track.” Clean-up immediate assistance and an initial estimated cost of $80m with an estimated commonwealth contribution of half that amount. Primary producer recovery grants of up to $75,000 at an additional estimated cost of $55m with an estimated commonwealth contribution of half that. Small businesses and nonprofit organisation recovery grants of up to $50,000 with half of the amount coming to a cost of $27m, shared between the commonwealth and New South Wales. At-flood property assessment program at an estimated initial cost of some $36m. We’ll also be providing $1m grants to each council in the 37 disaster-related declared LGAs to assist with their immediate social built economic and environmental needs. Push to replace gas with renewables amidst war in Ukraine at Sydney Energy Forum Answering a question from the audience on whether a need to reduce dependence on Russian gas amid war in Ukraine increases a need for greater investment in gas from other countries at the Sydney Energy Forum today, Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of International Energy Agency says: I put a big question mark on if those investments will be profitable. “We have to bring gas, oil demand down,” he said, pointing to a plethora of possible alternatives. We can replace gas with renewables, with nuclear power, with energy efficiency. There are already available gas reservoirs ... We can increase production from there. There is a huge amount of methane emissions today escaping many countries around the world exporting gas ... If we catch this methane, we can help to replace Russian gas. For the latest in Australian politics join Poll the Position webinar at 1pm Guardian’s Essential poll shows the prime minister Anthony Albanese’s approval is wavering as the honeymoon period fades. You can find out more about what the latest poll shows by joining Guardian’s political editor Katherine Murphy and Peter Lewis at the the live version at 1PM today following the below link. Asian Development Bank president addresses Sydney Energy Forum Masatsugu Asakawa, Asian Development Bank president, said “we all need to pick up the scale and pace of energy transition” at the Sydney Energy Forum today. My friends, we know transformation [to clean energy grid] is far from complete. The world needs to decarbonise. Asia and the Pacific are responsible for more than 50% of global greenhouse emissions. And it impacts small nations and the most vulnerable population. Asakawa points to a need for “collective action” on innovative solutions to “turn the tide”, urging leaders to “invest to get us on the path to a net zero future”. “In the role of new technologies ... access will be the key.” The transition to clean and efficient energy is fully compatible with robust economic growth. Minister defied advice on mask mandate Mary-Anne Thomas, the Victorian health minister, reveals she went against health advice not mandating masks indoors for several settings. The federal health minister, Mark Butler, has revealed the federal program providing 10 free rapid antigen tests every three months for concession card holders will end in July. Butler was speaking to 3AW Radio about the covid crisis in Australia, confirming that 300 Australians are “losing their life every single week”, with new data suggesting “Covid is the largest killer of Australians this year, overtaking coronary disease”. Asked if the free RATs could be extended beyond July, Butler said: No, I think that expiry is about the right time. [Early in 2022] we had a very ferocious debate at a time rapid tests were very hard to get ... The price has come down dramatically, the cost was averaging $24-$25 per test in January, they’re now down to about $8 a test. Pensioners and concession card holders can still get their allocation of up to 10 before the end of the month, and that can carry them through for a period of time. There are so many RATs out in the community, many state governments provide free access ... and they’re available if you live in an aged care facility. The problem we were facing is largely resolved. Butler said Australia is “going through a difficult period” and if employers feel they are able to continue their operations with employees working from home, they should heed the chief health officer’s advice to consider allowing staff to do so. Butler asked Australians “if you’re in indoor spaces, particularly crowded ones where you can’t socially distance, think about putting mask on,” signalling he may start wearing them to press conferences again. Asked why the government isn’t doing more, Butler said: We’re deep into the third year of the pandemic. There is a level of fatigue that governments and health authorities need to reflect when putting in measurers to deal with this third wave. We’ve tried to bring new energy about the importance of getting the third vaccine dose. Interest rate hikes dent consumer confidence Consumer confidence has fallen for the second week in a row, particularly for mortgage holders being hit by higher interest rates. The weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan Australian Consumer Confidence Rating saw a drop of 2.5% to 81.6, well under the last three decade’s monthly average of 112.4. Consumer confidence for those paying off a mortgage was down by a “sharp” 5.4%, the survey found. Since talk of rate hikes began in late April, consumer confidence among mortgage holders has fallen 25%, while confidence among renters is down 4%. CBA’s chief economist, Stephen Halmarick, says expected interest rate increases are likely “to see discretionary spending weaken further in coming months”. – with AAP Fog alert! Foggy conditions in Adelaide where a road weather alert has been issued by the SA state emergency service. More updates from the Sydney Energy Forum Ms Jennifer Granholm, US Secretary of Energy, says US President Joe Biden is “very enthused” about building out the clean energy transition at today’s Sydney Energy Forum: We want a modern grid with an expanded capacity. It is not just the flipping of a switch. It’s a period of time ... We want to plan responsible, with a sense of urgency. Granholm points to change being needed in the fossil fuel industry: “There is a moment for all of us to call upon diversification of fossil companies ... to become energy companies, and not just fossil energy companies,” she says, urging a move to clean energy sources, “whether it is hydrogen, or geothermal”. Clean energy development is: truly about energy security and energy independence as nations. We cannot be under the thumb of those who don’t share our values ... or under the thumb of those who [want to] control our supply chain. Climate is No 1 national security, economic challenge of region: Wong Conroy said development assistance doesn’t come “with strings attached” in reference to Pacific Island nations’ relationships with China: To demonstrate the conviction... only yesterday we announced an additional $2m of assistance to Kiribati to assist with their crippling drought, that is on top of the $600,000 we announced a couple of weeks ago. It is very important that aid is unconditional like that. Wong was asked if climate change has been overshadowed as the biggest threat facing the region and whether it will still be the centre of discussions at the forum this week. She has affirmed it remains the biggest threat the regions faces: I can only say this, that climate is central in the statements of many leaders passed, it is the number one national security, economic challenge that the region faces. Obviously, people have spoken about climate and spoken about strategic competition and have spoken about Covid and the path of recovery where there are real challenges for the Pacific. We know that there is a risk that we had a discussion today about a lower development path, what they call economic scarring as a result of Covid. This is not a region that can afford that we need to work with them to try to about that. Conroy, Wong defend Australia’s emissions target The media conference is asking Wong and Pat Conroy, the minister for international development, about the adequacy of Australia’s climate stance. Conroy says it’s credible for Australia to host a COP forum when its emissions target is one of the highest in the developed world. Wong says the 43% target is “quite a substantial target” and says coal mines “will be dealt with in accordance with Australian law”: I would make the point that the target that we are proposing would see Australia adding 2% renewable energy for our domestic market by 2030. Wong says she hasn’t been asked at the forum whether Australia would not allow any more coal reserves of gas most to be utilised. Penny Wong has emphasised the importance the forum remain united, in light of the withdrawal of Kiribati from the forum: I had a very good discussion today with the secretary of FSM and we spoke about the lived experience of the Micronesian states to climate change. And, as you know, that was one of the key aspects of Prime Minister Albanese’s election campaign. I’d like to make a comment about the unity of the forum, which has obviously been a big discussion over these last week. The region is stronger together. It’s a simple proposition. The region is stronger together. And in the bilateral they have had, in the discussions I have had in my previous visits in the dialogue today, leaders talked about the challenges the region faces, climate change, Covid, and recovery from Covid, both of which have fallen harder on this region and on many other parts of the world and, of course, strategic competition. And all the nations of this region are seeking to navigate those challenges. ...and we do it best when we do it together. That is the approach Australia has taken. That is the approach the Pacific Islands Forum has taken and that is why Pacific for immunity is so important. As you know, There have been a lot of discussions about Pacific Islands Forum unity and the position the Australian government has consistently taken is we were seeking to support whatever the consensus could deliver, because the most important thing was to ensure that at this time, in a contestable, in a world confronting climate, Covid, and economic recovery from Covid, that the forum remain united. ‘We are here to listen’: Penny Wong in Suva Penny Wong, the minister for foreign affairs, is giving a press conference from Suva where she is attending the Pacific Islands Forum. I said today at the leaders forum dialogue that we are here to listen and learn. It is obviously my first forum and it was a very important to listen to the contributions from the various perspectives of presidents and prime ministers around the table and they gained a lot from that. As they have said previously, the Australian government, the new Australian government is committed to bringing new energy and new resources to the Pacific and we recognise, in particular, the importance of climate change. China’s monopoly on solar under spotlight at forum Reporter Rafqa Touma here with some updates from today’s Sydney Energy Forum, where leaders in government and industry from around the world are gathering to discuss clean energy supply, sustainability and security in the Indo-Pacific region. Dr Fatih Birol, Executive Director of International Energy Agency, urges that leaders “need to think about” China’s monopoly on solar energy manufacturing “from an energy security perspective” at the Sydney Energy Forum today: Of all the manufacturing capacity around the world ... about 80% of the global supply chain manufacturing comes from one single country – China. China did excellently within the last 15 years to bring the cost of solar down, providing multiple benefits around the world. But at the same time, today, 80% ... is a big number. Every country “relying on technology from one single country ... is something we all need to think about from an energy security perspective”. Victoria has joined NSW in reducing the state’s Covid reinfection period to four weeks, as the state government recommends people wear masks indoors and in crowded public places. It follows similar moves by the WA and ACT governments yesterday in line with advice from the the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. The previous Covid reinfection period – when people are exempt from testing and isolating – was 12 weeks. The Victorian government has also requested employers consider working-from-home arrangements, noting there has been a 53% increase in the number of Victorians in hospital with Covid over the past two weeks. All smiles in Suva Guardian Australia’s Pacific editor, Kate Lyons, is currently in Suva covering the Pacific Islands Forum. This morning, she was there for a warm greeting between Jacinda Ardern, the prime minster of New Zealand, and Penny Wong, Australia’s minister for foreign affairs. Flood toll on NSW roads emerges NSW roads are significantly damaged by last week’s floods, as this image from Wiseman’s Ferry shows. The state’s Rural Fire Service has reminded Australians the unknown condition of the roads is another reason why it’s unsafe to cross flood waters. ‘I am very uncomfortable with this voice’: Abbott on Indigenous voice to parliament The former Liberal prime minister, Tony Abbott, also shared his views on the Indigenous voice to parliament, which Labor wants to hold a referendum on as soon as 2023. Abbott told Radio National: Let me say I think the opposition is right in the first instance to demand all the detail from the government. Personally, I am very uncomfortable with this voice, with what Malcolm Turnbull called a third chamber of parliament. I’m uncomfortable electing a body determined by race. When Abbott was pulled up on the fact the voice is not a third chamber of parliament he said he was merely “citing what my successor said” – which isn’t a great way to engage in public discourse, happily repeating a misrepresentation as long as someone else said it first. Abbott continued: You can’t ask the people for a blank cheque on something as significant as this. If asked to vote on an unspecified voice, the natural response will be to say, ‘If you don’t know, vote no.’ The last thing we want is a referendum designed to forward reconciliation defeated and inevitably that puts reconciliation back. The most likely referendum proposal is to include an enabling provision in the constitution, specifying that parliament will legislate the design of the voice. Not necessarily a blank cheque, depending on how much detail is released about the design of the body to be legislated. There were 10,627 new cases in the last reporting period, and 39 people are in intensive care. ‘Finding common ground’: Albanese on nations working together Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has begun his opening address at the Sydney Energy Forum, emphasising the need for nations to work together towards a common good: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities and laid bare challenges that we simply cannot ignore. There are many lessons that we will all take from this experience, but one of the most critical ones for me is that we are stronger when we work together. We are, for all of our differences, one common human family and we all call this one fragile planet our home. When we pause and reflect on this, we recognise our connection to one another. We recognise that we have a common stake in each other and that the best way to meet the challenges in front of us is by finding common ground. That is what this forum is about – finding common ground. And that’s the message I’m carrying with me today, a message underscored by your presence here today. The diversity and unity of purpose in this room makes it very clear – all of you coming together from across sectors and nations because you understand that our future is linked. All of us here know what needs to be done. The nature of the challenge and the science is not in question. Its urgency and scope is clear. The question is our ability, but importantly as well our appetite to seize the opportunities that it contains and to shape them in our common interests. As Prime Minister, I’m committed to renewing Australia’s standing in our region. Reporter Rafqa Touma will be bringing you more updates about Albanese’s address here on the blog but you can also read political editor Katherine Murphy’s preview. There were 10,806 new cases in the last reporting period, and 58 people are in intensive care. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) and Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) are calling on the health minister, Mark Butler, to reverse the decision to let the telehealth items lapse amidst the latest Covid-19 outbreak. The bodies want to meet with Butler to discuss the reinstatement of Covid-19 telehealth items cancelled on 1 July. Dr Omar Khorshid, the AMA president, said: These changes undermine the ability of patients to access their doctors, and in particular for GPs to prescribe antivirals for Covid-positive patients and will lead to costs elsewhere in the health system, including in overstretched hospitals. Khorshid said the item for telephone consults longer that 20 minutes with a GP – a key part of the government’s “Living with Covid” strategy – was critical and must be restored: Prescribing antivirals is time consuming, requiring a GP to consider complex eligibility requirements, contraindications and drug interactions and then arrange for patients to obtain the medication while isolating. Even simple cases take thirty minutes to an hour to properly complete. Professor Karen Price, the president of RACGP, said given the growing number of COVID-19 cases and the unknown impacts of long COVID going forward, enabling access to longer telephone consultations was vital: GPs have told the RACGP the removal of Medicare patient rebates for longer phone consultations has reduced access to care and increased health gaps for vulnerable patients. This includes rural communities, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, older people, people with disability and mental health concerns, many of whom already have poorer health outcomes than the general population,” Price said. The former Liberal prime minister, Tony Abbott, has praised the Albanese government’s handling of the Pacific step-up, even implicitly criticising the Morrison government for being focused on the election instead of China’s ambitions in the region. Abbott told Radio National: I think it would be very serious if China were to establish a string of military bases in the South Pacific. It’s obvious that’s China and the Beijing regime’s intention. It’s important Australia do everything it can to ensure the people of Pacific understand their peril, not just ours. Because the Beijing regime may come to these countries all smiles, but Beijing is out for Beijing’s interests, not anybody else’s. Asked if the new government had been more active than Morrison’s, Abbott replied: I certainly applaud the fact Penny Wong went to Solomon Islands almost immediately, and the prime minister is going to the Pacific Islands Forum. The new government is being absolutely active in the Pacific as it should be – good on them. I don’t have the slightest criticism [of them]. Asked if it was a mistake for former foreign minister, Marise Payne, not to immediately go to Solomon Islands after it announced a draft security pact with China, he said: That’s dirty water under the bridge. I suppose at the time we were on the verge of an election campaign, and people were a bit focused elsewhere. The new government got straight down to business, good on them for that. Government to outline plans on responsible lending laws Stephen Jones, the assistant treasurer and minister for financial services, will address the Responsible Lending Summit this morning and outline the government’s plans on responsible lending laws, including buy-now-pay-later and pay day lending. The Buy-Now-Pay-Later sector currently doesn’t have the same regulations as banks do when they provide loans. If you want to hear more about the issues in the sector ahead of Jones’ address, senior business reporter Ben Butler wrote this article when Jones first announced plans for regulation. New Omicron subvariants becoming dominant in Australia Paul Kelly, the country’s chief medical officer, is on ABC and says the latest Covid-19 subvariants BA4 and 5 are becoming the dominant variant in Australia: We have seen a rise in this new variant of Omicron, so it is still the COVID-19 virus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is just a different – slight differences in the way that that virus looks and how our immune system looks at it. We do know that this new variant has caused waves in other countries and is now becoming the dominant variant in Australia. We have no suggestion at the moment that it causes for severe disease but it escapes our immune system, whether that is due to previous infection or vaccination. We do expect that these new variants will cause a rise in cases and probably hospitalisations in the coming weeks. Kelly has reiterated the importance of third and fourth vaccine doses. Asked about the difference that reducing the reinfection period makes, Kelly says that the decisions are based on evidence as the new variants are more infectious: The new BA4 and BA5 are more infectious and there is strong evidence that you can get reinfected earlier than what was previously the case. It is important that anyone who develops symptoms again 28 or more days after they have had a previous COVID-19 infection, to get tested and to take the appropriate arrangements in terms of isolation. A new campaign has launched today to tackle racism by the Australian Human Rights Commission. Chin Tan, the race discrimination commissioner, was on ABC Radio this morning discussing the campaign he says calls on all Australians to reflect on the causes and impacts of racism, not only on its victims but Australia’s collective wellbeing as a society. Tan said the government hasn’t funded the campaign itself but its framework. Tan said the funding for the campaign had come from the corporate and private sector. Sarah Collard, Guardian Australia’s Indigenous affairs reporter, has more on how the campaign was partly funded by a disaffected former Collingwood football club sponsor. Cronulla beach washed away by rowdy surf The dangerous surf conditions along the NSW coast is causing massive erosion on Sydney’s Cronulla beach. The North Cronulla lifeguard tower even had to be lifted out of reach of the dangerous surf via crane last night. The St George and Sutherland Shire Leader is reporting that “the tower had been perilously close to falling into the ocean after being undermined by another big swell on the weekend.” The Leader said that the Sutherland Shire Council ordered its removal early on Monday with the main section lifted off after 8pm. Mayor of the Sutherland Shire Council, Carmelo Pesce, told the Leader a new seawall at North Cronulla beach was provided for in a draft plan of management, which had recently been finalised and the council was also seeking state government assistance to repair beaches.

We have seen a rise in the number of scam texts that are occurring. These are predominantly run by criminals who are sophisticated. Some of them in Australia, many overseas, but the technology needs to keep up with that in order to keep Australians safe. Rowland is asked about the scepticism Andy Penn, the CEO of Telstra, has expressed that the new rules can actually deliver for consumers because of the difficulty stopping scam messages. She said the technology has become more sophisticated to enable these scam texts to be identified: We know for a fact as the evidence shows, in just over a year since we have had obligations in place about scam calls, we have had some half a billion scam calls being blocked. Will this mean that every scam call, every scam text and every scam email will no longer reach innocent Australian consumers? The honest answer is no. But we can make it better and we can ensure that there is consistency across the industry so that consumers have confidence that no matter who their provider is. Abbott pays tribute to Abe Tony Abbott is on ABC Radio paying tribute to Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe – “the best friend Australia has ever had from Japan”. Abbott said Abe’s designing the Quad is “the reason India is there”, which might not have been the case had it been designed by the US. He said he didn’t believe the criticisms of Abe as a WW2 revisionist are valid. History shouldn’t be used a stick ... that’s what China has tended to do with Japan. Abbott is asked about the whether the new government should be given credit for the step-up in the Pacific. He said the new government was “being absolutely active in the Pacific as it should be. Good on them.” Asked whether it was a mistake not to send Marise Paine under the coalition government, Abbott said: “That’s dirty water under the bridge.” Asked whether the opposition should support a yes vote in referendum on Uluru Statement of the Heart, Abbott reinforced he did not support an Aboriginal voice in parliament and said the opposition was right to ask for more detail. ‘They need to get their story straight’ Jim Chalmers is asked about Sussan Ley’s calls to cancel the jobs and skills summit and Angus Taylor’s call for a seat at the table: They need to get their story straight. Asked about whether independents will be invited, Chalmers said the invitation list hasn’t been finalised: A hundred people sounds like a lot of people until you see who’s in the first list and who might not be. Even for the people who aren’t in the 100, we will find ways to consult with them in meaningful ways, including all parts of the parliament. When it comes to invitations for the opposition, Chalmers says: We will consider people who want to be there on their merits. Let’s see if the opposition is actually serious. I think what you just quoted from yesterday, where one person was saying it should be cancelled, another person was insisting on being invited. Let’s see if they’re serious first. I mean, they have had to bring people together in the way that we hope to bring people together. They didn’t do that. The big reason why we’ve had this waste a decade of missed opportunities in the economy, whether its energy policy chaos, or not enough Australians trained for key roles. We need to see if they’re serious, they haven’t shown so far that they are. Chalmers on a ‘wasted decade’ Treasurer Jim Chalmers is on ABC Radio discussing the jobs and skills summit he and the prime minister announced yesterday which will take place in September: There are a whole range of issues here which have combined to create what I think has been a wasted decade of missed opportunities in the economy. Too much division, too much looking for the things which divide us rather than a common ground. There’s more common ground in these areas than people realise. Asked about the calls from business to include a temporary two-year increase in skilled migration to increase it to 200,000 places a year, Chalmers says migration shouldn’t be considered the only solution when it comes to the challenges facing the workforce: We’ve had a quite unusual period when it comes to migration and as we emerge from it, we should work together to get the settings right but what I want to make sure we don’t see this as the one lever that you would pull to solve our issues and inflation and wages and labor shortages and skill shortages. We can get migration right without seeing it as a substitute for doing all of the other things in the economy, which will get that wages growth and fill these skills shortages and deliver the right kind of prosperity that we want to see into the future. ‘The Pacific is the part of the world where the US rightly looks to Australia to lead’ Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, has warned of the use of “force or coercion” in the South China Sea and “intensification of major power competition” – references to China’s rising power in the Indo-Pacific. Marles made the comments in a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies on his visit to the US, committing Australia to closer cooperation with the US, higher defence spending and to address climate change in part as a national security issue: All of us here today understand the challenges we face: a military build-up occurring at a rate unseen since world war two; the development and deployment of new weapons that challenge our military capability edge; expanding cyber and grey zone capabilities which blur the line between peace and conflict; and the intensification of major power competition in ways that both concentrate and transcend geographic confines. These trends compel an even greater Australian focus on the Indo-Pacific. For the first time in decades we are thinking hard about the security of our strategic geography, the viability of our trade and supply routes, and above all the preservation of an inclusive regional order founded on rules agreed by all, not the coercive capabilities of a few. In particular we worry about use of force or coercion to advance territorial claims, as is occurring in the South China Sea, and its implications for the any number of places in the Indo-Pacific where borders or sovereignty is disputed. On Australia’s relationship with the Pacific, where Australia is racing to persuade nations not to follow Solomon Islands’ lead in signing a security pact with China, Marles said: The Pacific is where Australia must invest in effective regionalism by reinforcing the Pacific Islands Forum and other regional institutions that are so key to regional resilience and agency. We must do this not only because of our unique connections to the Pacific but because Pacific security so directly impacts on our own security. Given this reality, the Pacific is the part of the world where the United States rightly looks to Australia to lead. And we will. We will not take our status for granted. Pacific Island countries have choices about their partners. And we will work to earn their trust. The Pacific has been clear in saying that geopolitical competition is of lesser concern to them than the threat of rising sea levels, economic insecurity and transnational crime. Australia respects and understands this position. And we are listening. And while we will not ask our partners to pick a side, I am confident that an Australia which collaborates and invests in shared priorities with the Pacific is an Australia which will be the natural partner of choice for the Pacific. SMS scam protections Australians will be better protected from text message scams as new regulations for telecommunications companies come into effect today. The code, registered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) today, will require the companies to trace, identify and block SMS scam messages, and publish information for customers on how to identify and report scams. Mobile phone companies could face up to $250,000 in fines for failing to comply with the new code. Reporter Josh Taylor has more: NSW Health today announced that – effective immediately – the Covid reinfection period is now four weeks, down from 12. It follows similar moves by the WA and ACT governments yesterday, in line with advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. Tasmania had already changed its reinfection period on Friday last week. Anyone in the state experiencing Covid symptoms from 28 days after their isolation ends is now required to test for the virus. In a statement, the chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said the new advice was due to the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants “circulating widely in NSW”: They are more able to evade immunity gained from previous infection and vaccination reinfection is more likely and possible just weeks after a prior infection. This post was amended on 12 July to add the date Tasmania changed the reinfection period. Prime minister Anthony Albanese is due to make the opening speech at the Sydney Energy Forum today. He will tell the forum Australia has rejoined the ranks of “trusted global partners” on climate action. He’ll be making the speech before travelling to the Pacific Islands Forum in Fiji, where leaders are set to meet later in the week. Covid-19 hospitalisations are surging in Australia from the winter Omicron wave, with pressures on hospitals leading to some elective surgeries being cancelled and paramedics overwhelmed. In NSW the Covid reinfection period has been reduced to four weeks down from 12 weeks previously, from today. The first monkeypox case has been detected in Queensland. The state’s authorities say the public health risk is “very low” but it comes after community transmission was found in NSW last week.

That is the message from a report that makes the alternative case, suggesting embracing clean energy could dramatically expand the electricity, mining and mineral processing industries while reducing living costs. It says the NT economy could be transformed through incentives for renewable-powered manufacturing and downstream minerals processing, targets for mines to transition to 100% clean energy and electric machinery by 2030 and support for Indigenous communities to be equity partners in zero-carbon developments. It calls on the NT and federal governments to fund common infrastructure to turn what is known as the 10-gigawatt vision into a reality – for example, transmission lines connecting Darwin and Alice Springs to allow clean energy developments in remote locations. Eytan Lenko, chairman of the thinktank Beyond Zero Emissions, commissioned the report while living in Darwin in 2018 after seeing divisions in the community between people concerned about the health of the economy and those opposed to fracking. He says the full plan would cost businesses about $20bn out to 2030 on today’s prices, though the scale of the investment is expected to fall as clean tech becomes cheaper. It estimates it could create more than 8,000 jobs and yield more than $2bn in annual export revenue. Recommended projects range from immediately achievable to more ambitious, but Lenko says energy economics have shifted to a point where the entire plan is realistic with the right policy support. He points to cases where industrial sites have signed deals to run on solar rather than gas or diesel, which remain default fuels in the NT. The report quotes the NT Labor government’s 2017 renewable energy roadmap, which found an inflection point had been reached where it was sometimes cheaper to build clean energy projects than maintain fossil fuel plants and jobs could be created in energy-intensive industries powered by lower-cost renewable energy. Renewable energy costs 30%-50% more in the NT than elsewhere in Australia but this premium is expected to disappear if the industry reaches scale. “This is an alternative economic pathway to prosperity in the Northern Territory that doesn’t rely on extracting gas and performing acts that are damaging to the environment, don’t have a social licence and don’t bring that many jobs,” Lenko says. “Nobody is saying it will be easy – it’s definitely an engineering challenge – but I don’t think it’s any more of a challenge than large-scale fracking in the NT, which is equally complex.” The report finds adopting electric vehicles could lower the cost of running a car by as much 80%, given Territorians face inflated petrol prices and there are relatively few arterial roads that would need charging infrastructure. Similarly the report estimates replacing Darwin’s gas-fired electricity with solar power and batteries could cut electricity bills by about 30%. The report is co-written by the green group Environment Centre NT and will be launched on Thursday at the NT parliament by the territory’s renewables and energy minister, Dale Wakefield. It follows a similar Beyond Zero Emissions blueprint for the South Australian city of Port Augusta to replace coal with solar. That 2012 report helped kickstart a community campaign that by last year had yielded $5bn in planned investment in 13 clean energy projects, though the push suffered a setback in April when the flagship solar thermal plant was cancelled. The NT government has a target of 50% renewables for households and businesses by 2030, but the commitment does not apply to off-grid mines and developments. The government recently lifted a moratorium on exploration fracking for shale gas in the Beetaloo basin, about 500km south-east of Darwin, after an inquiry found risks associated with the industry could be managed. The inquiry also recommended that fracking be allowed only if all greenhouse gas emissions within Australia were offset. The NT government is yet to explain how this will happen. NT emissions are expected to have increased significantly – by about two-thirds – last year after the $54bn Ichthys LNG project started production. The report estimates they could double again, to nearly 50m tonnes a year, if the LNG and shale gas industries expand as proposed. It would push the NT’s per capita carbon pollution to nearly 200 tonnes, four times greater than any country. Shar Molloy, director of the Environment Centre NT, says the NT remains “incredibly focused” on gas, in part due to an unbending belief that renewable energy is more expensive. It led to federal Labor promising $1.5bn to open up the Beetaloo basin if it won last month’s election, a pledge that drew accusations it was backing a “carbon disaster” four times larger than Adani’s Carmichael mine. “There is a resistance to renewables and a failure to grasp that, given where the world needs to move, gas is not a transition fuel,” Molloy says. “This is an incredible export opportunity. There are markets in Asia that simply do not have the resource or space to do this themselves.” The NT government denies it is focused on gas alone. Wakefield says its number one priority is creating jobs and that both solar and natural gas have a role to play in the territory becoming a world-class energy export hub. She says she welcomes the Beyond Zero Emissions report as “an important step towards realising this vision”. The minister says the government is working on a range of reforms to implement its 50% renewable energy target. As evidence, she points to private sector investment in a $40m solar project at Katherine and the $43m Batchelor and Manton dam solar farms, which she says created 170 jobs. The report says there is a significant opportunity to build an industry in renewable energy-fuelled hydrogen, which is increasingly used in transport and electricity in Japan and South Korea, with estimates the global hydrogen market could be worth US$1.25tn by 2050. The report estimates the NT could capture two-thirds of the Australian renewable hydrogen industry. This alone would require nearly five gigawatts of clean energy capacity. It estimates another three gigawatts of renewable energy could be exported through new transmission lines to Asia and the Australian national grid. It says delivering this and other industries would require an ambitious plan and marketing strategy to attract clean tech industries; studies to assess which energy storage options, transmission lines and other clean technologies could best support solar farms; consideration of which incentives – whether interest-free loans, payroll tax holidays or cheap land for targeted companies – could lead to 100% renewable manufacturing. The report says the sort of support was provided to the Ichthys LNG project through the federal export credit agency – including millions of dollars in export credits and hundreds of millions in loans – could be made available to renewable-powered manufacturers. It recommends introducing incentives that would encourage companies to process minerals in the NT using renewable energy. Possibilities include charging a lower royalty rate for processed minerals and establishing a domestic reservation policy that required a proportion of minerals to be processed into metals locally. And it stresses the need for a green deal with Indigenous communities, based on the principle of free, prior and informed consent, so they share the benefits of a renewable energy boom. Most remote communities mainly rely on expensive and highly polluting diesel generation for electricity. The report says the technology now exists to stop using diesel and introduce near-100% renewable microgrids. It gives the example of Yuendumu, a community of about 700 people about 300km north-west of Alice Springs. It runs on a diesel generator supported by a two-year-old 500kW solar array, which provides about one-fifth of its energy. The report says it could use a renewable hydrogen microgrid – including solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and hydrogen fuel cells that store excess solar and wind energy – for 95% of its electricity at a cost of $10.7m. While Hydrogen fuel cells are still developing technology, it says this model is likely to be cheaper than diesel over 25 years. Lenko says: “We know the NT has the best renewable energy resource in the world and renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy. We just need to free our minds to look at what’s possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2020/may/02/framing-the-horizon-dwellings-that-blend-with-the-desert","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-02T15:00:26Z","webTitle":"Framing the horizon: dwellings that blend with the desert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/02/framing-the-horizon-dwellings-that-blend-with-the-desert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/02/framing-the-horizon-dwellings-that-blend-with-the-desert","fields":{"headline":"Framing the horizon: dwellings that blend with the desert","bodyText":"Beloved by artists, mystics and hermits, the desert is a place for contemplation and coming face-to-face with oneself; a place to fully detox from the outside world and enjoy the purifying nothingness of a vast, barren, empty space. The desert retreats featured on these pages – the Glass Pavilion in Granada, Spain, and the Desert Courtyard House, the Desert Nomad House and the Levin Residence, all in Arizona – are an invitation to do just that. These desert retreats are designed to help their inhabitants feel a sense of peace through connection to nature. Situation and design combine to turn the poetic idea of the idyll into reality. Architects designing homes or retreats in remote locations, whether mountain, coast, lake, forest, river, plains or desert, may choose to evoke the sculptural and make their dwellings stand out against a canvas of land, sea or sky. But sometimes, in the desert, as elsewhere, the dwellings are carefully camouflaged, often at the owner’s behest in order to give nature its due supremacy, and they sometimes recycle earth, gravel or turf from the excavation of their plots. Many use local, natural materials, not only to reduce transportation costs and carbon footprint, but also to provide an organic sense of belonging to the terrain. In these unique desert dwellings, the watchword is not abundance but lack, and this lack is embraced by those who want total escape. A stay in the desert is a chance to experience a wilderness that is sometimes brutal – only the hardiest plants and animals can survive here. Not for the faint-hearted, a desert retreat is the diametric opposite of a cosy rural escape. The retreats featured here tap into the desert’s mythic status and possess an enigmatic quality. The vast blankness of the landscape provides an opportunity to practise serious abstraction: it is the perfect backdrop for bold, sculptural forms. Experiencing (and sometimes mitigating) the intense stimuli of desert immersion is the central idea behind many designs. The desert is harsh, and sometimes inhabitants need to withdraw into a protective shell. Interiors in these homes are cocooning, cave-like and cool – devoid of much fuss. Why bring endless stuff into the desert when the point of being there is to escape it all? These are not retreats for long stays, but are designed around sleeping, resting, meditating, cloud-watching and, of course, star-gazing. With scant resources, desert retreats must be sustainable, using solar power and passive heating and cooling, and the remoteness of some locations means that prefabrication is essential. Aesthetic intentions range from careful camouflage to experiments in industrial homage. Positioned to capture poetic moments – the way a mountainside reddens as the evening sun slides over it, or the first rays of dawn – many retreats here function as viewing apertures. The invitation is to arrive, switch off all distraction, and simply be, allowing your gaze to wander unchecked over the sublime emptiness.

Dwarfed by a gigantic landscape, visitors can lie back to watch shooting stars streak through a night sky unspoiled by light pollution. Designed by Slovenian studio OFIS Arhitekti, the Glass Pavilion began as a project that aimed to prove that glass can be used as a fully structural element. The glazing features a near-invisible coating that prevents the interior from overheating. The Y-shaped structure rests on a mirrored wooden platform. The Desert Courtyard House Designed by Wendell Burnette Architects, this luxurious, monolithic courtyard house is located in the Sonoran Desert. The house is built from rammed earth, concrete, glass and weathered steel, merging land, house and sky. A glass-floored bridge gallery hovers over the earth so inhabitants get a sense of the natural world. Steps lead down on to a terrace and a narrow infinity pool that draws the eye towards a mountain peak beyond. The alchemy of water, rocks and cacti appeals to mind and senses. The Desert Nomad House Concealed within a forest of saguaro cacti in Arizona’s Tucson Mountains, the Desert Nomad House (Studio Rick Joy) is a cluster of three cuboid dwellings, each with its own function: sleeping, working, and relaxing. The rusted-steel boxes huddle within a natural bowl-like formation at the foot of the Tucson Mountains. Each one is arranged perfectly to give a ‘single aperture’ view of the desert landscape. The steel-plate exteriors glow burnt sienna in the setting sun and pick up rust-hued tones in the desert earth. Inside, the home is clad in warm, natural maple veneer and dotted with objets d’art. Levin Residence Designed by Ibarra Rosano Design Architects, the Levin Residence in Marana, Arizona, cantilevers over a sloping terrain, providing shelter for desert animals beneath the house. The home surrounds a courtyard with a pool and a deck with a freestanding black framework, which further focuses the views."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2019/dec/04/scottish-power-build-solar-panels-windfarms","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-04T17:08:40Z","webTitle":"Scottish Power plans to build solar panels beside windfarms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/04/scottish-power-build-solar-panels-windfarms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2019/dec/04/scottish-power-build-solar-panels-windfarms","fields":{"headline":"Scottish Power plans to build solar panels beside windfarms","bodyText":"Scottish Power plans to squeeze more renewable electricity from its onshore windfarms by covering the ground beside the turbines with photovoltaic panels and batteries. The wind power firm has applied for permission to build its first solar power projects beneath the blades of its existing windfarms in Cornwall, Lancashire and Coldham. Scottish Power says it hopes to include solar panels in the vast majority of its future onshore windfarms across Scotland and Ireland, depending on whether the ground conditions are suitable for panels. Keith Anderson, Scottish Power’s chief executive, said: “Every green megawatt of electricity will be crucial if we stand any chance of hitting net zero in 2050. This means squeezing the absolute maximum potential out of every clean energy project that we consider.” The Guardian revealed last month that Scottish Power had kicked off plans for an expansion of onshore windfarm projects across Scotland in anticipation of an expected government U-turn on support for wind power projects. The company’s renewable energy division has considered almost 100 sites in Scotland and Ireland for a new breed of windfarm that uses fewer powerful turbines and can be fitted with solar panels and batteries. In some cases, adding 10MW panels and 10MW of energy storage could double the green energy capacity of small windfarm sites. “In the UK and Ireland the perfect of blend of clean power from onshore renewables should include a mixture of clean energy technologies,” Anderson said. “The costs for building wind, solar and batteries have reduced considerably in recent years, and they complement each other very well. They perform best at different times of the day and at different times of the year.” Scottish Power is developing more than 1,000MW of new onshore wind capacity, however the UK will need to build at least this capacity of onshore wind every year for the next three decades if it hopes to meet its 2050 climate targets, according to the Committee on Climate Change. Anderson said: “In the next 18 months I believe hybrids will be the new normal for all renewable energy developers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/jul/06/from-dusted-off-bikes-to-electric-dreams-uk-green-economy-booms-on-back-of-covid-19","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-06T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"From dusted-off bikes to electric dreams: UK green economy booms on back of Covid-19","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/06/from-dusted-off-bikes-to-electric-dreams-uk-green-economy-booms-on-back-of-covid-19","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/jul/06/from-dusted-off-bikes-to-electric-dreams-uk-green-economy-booms-on-back-of-covid-19","fields":{"headline":"From dusted-off bikes to electric dreams: UK green economy booms on back of Covid-19","bodyText":"The queues were “absolutely crazy”, says Gavin Hudson, the owner of the cycle repair startup Butternut Bikes. As lockdown descended he began fixing old bikes in the parking lot of a Methodist church in north London, before moving his services to a furloughed pub in Crouch End. However, the surge in demand for cycle repairs meant the pop-up was soon able to afford a permanent address. “Some people come in and tell us they haven’t been on a bike in 10 years,” Hudson says. “They are dragging all kinds of bikes, covered in cobwebs, out from the shed to get back on the roads. It’s great. I think it’s really true that there are few problems in society today that can’t be made better by getting people walking and cycling more.” Butternut Bikes is one of countless British businesses poised to profit from a green economic boom in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. While the government faces growing pressure to unveil a post-pandemic economic stimulus package that is climate friendly, Britain’s economic green shoots are already in evidence. Steven Jennings, a partner at the global advisory firm PwC, says the lockdown has triggered a paradigm shift for consumers and companies that is already accelerating developments in sustainability – even without prompts from the government. “One of the unintended consequences of the coronavirus crisis is the opportunity for businesses to think about the future. If a company has to rebuild itself, it makes sense to reconfigure how it works to be more sustainable,” Jennings says. The challenge for the Treasury is to design a stimulus package that seizes the opportunities emerging from the coronavirus crisis, which can tackle large-scale climate challenges, too. PwC includes low-carbon transport in its five-pillar plan to “build back better”, alongside major stimulus plans to accelerate low-carbon electricity generation, cut emissions from heavy industry and help build a green workforce with the skills to carry out the plans. Those without a banged-up bike in the shed will struggle to buy a new one because of the huge demand and a supply-chain hangover from China’s manufacturing lockdown at the start of the year. For many, the answer may be shared-cycle schemes, electric scooter rentals or even the purchase of an electric vehicle. Lime is one of the e-mobility firms booming in lockdown. The company expects to have attracted 20,000 new riders to its shared electric bike rental scheme by the time lockdown lifts and plans to offer e-scooters in the UK soon, too. Alan Clarke, a director of the firm, says the number of new Lime users has grown every week since lockdown restrictions started to be eased and that riders are taking longer journeys than before. The growth comes despite a surge in competition from rivals at Mobike, Freebike and Uber’s cycle offering, Jump. “Ultimately, the biggest reason people don’t cycle, walk or e-scoot is because most of the time, city infrastructure doesn’t prioritise these modes of transport,” Clarke says. “As governments are now being forced to rethink how they approach urban travel, and organisations like TfL deliver bold and transformative improvements, we do anticipate an influx of new riders over the next few months, as people search out alternative travel options.” The number of people considering the purchase of an electric vehicle is rising, too; in part because the connection between Covid-19 deaths and air pollution has underlined the importance of clean transport. PwC estimates that government incentives could help the sector support 220,000 jobs. Ian Johnston, the chief executive of the vehicle-charging firm Engenie, says there has been a huge uplift in the number of retail parks preparing to install charging points. The company fits rapid chargers on behalf of retail landlords and councils at no upfront cost, in exchange for a share of the charge-point revenues. “Landlords are looking for new streams of revenues and retail tenants need new ways to drive footfall back to their stores,” he says. “The economic pressure on both means people are taking another look at vehicle charging.” A boom in electric transport holds important implications for Britain’s energy system, offering new opportunities for green tech companies. The demand slump during the lockdown combined with record renewable energy generation has helped to provide “a window into the future net zero carbon world”, according to Jennings. “We have had high penetration of renewable energy and negative wholesales prices at certain times of the day,” he says. “With the right government policies and regulation, more new business models will emerge, which could prove a tipping point for the likes of electric vehicle charging, batteries and time-of-use energy tariffs.” Battery operators can help balance the system by charging up when there is more than enough renewable energy on the grid and discharging the clean electricity when it is needed. Electric vehicles can play the same role when plugged into a smart charger. Steven Meersman, the founder of the battery operator Zenobe, says the firm has been working flat out during the lockdown to manage the “increased uptick in demand for our services”. Even energy supply deals that offer to pay homes and companies to use more energy when there is an abundance of wind and solar power can play a role in helping to make better use of a renewable energy boom. Greg Jackson, the founder and chief executive of Octopus Energy, says demand for the energy supplier’s Agile tariff has climbed by 50% during the lockdown. The tariff offers half-hourly pricing for electricity and lets customers benefit when costs go negative. “This is a wake-up call for policymakers and regulators that making the small changes needed to enable a smart energy grid will be essential to the green recovery so many of us are calling for,” Jackson says. “This can be done today and will unlock a revolution in cheap, clean, electric heating, electric vehicles and a decentralised electricity system.” The fifth pillar of PwC’s plan for a green economic recovery is also in the home. Jennings believes a nationwide upgrade of drafty homes will help amplify the benefits of Britain’s electric future, boost jobs and offer a £3.20 benefit to the UK’s GDP for every £1 invested. It is a zero-risk approach to lowering carbon emissions and household bills, while raising the quality of life and health standards, which is rumoured to have left the prime minister Boris Johnson’s chief aide, Dominic Cummings, cold. However, he may have misjudged the public mood. “One of the barriers to better home insulation has been public apathy but as people spend more time at home this may change,” Jennings says. “A recent PwC survey showed that 60% are more engaged with their energy use than they were before the lockdown. If people are more interested in home improvements and paying attention to their energy use, it makes sense to prioritise home energy efficiency.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/oct/31/net-zero-what-if-australia-misses-the-moment-on-climate-action","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-30T19:00:30Z","webTitle":"Net zero: what if Australia misses the moment on climate action?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/31/net-zero-what-if-australia-misses-the-moment-on-climate-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/oct/31/net-zero-what-if-australia-misses-the-moment-on-climate-action","fields":{"headline":"Net zero: what if Australia misses the moment on climate action?","bodyText":"For a national leader who had just been told up to $80bn in fossil fuel export industries were on the chopping block, Scott Morrison seemed remarkably sanguine. “I am not concerned about our future exports,” the prime minister said at a press conference on Wednesday. “I’m very aware of the many views that are held around the world but I tell you what – our policies will be set here in Australia.” Morrison’s dismissive response was to a question about what observers say is the biggest shift in international climate politics since the signing of the Paris agreement five years ago. In the space of five weeks, three of Australia’s biggest trading partners – first China and then over the past week Japan and South Korea – promised to go “carbon-neutral” by 2050 or shortly after. Long-time observers of climate change diplomacy said the scale of what is happening should not be underestimated. “It’s really significant. It shows there is potential for hope – that we can really achieve what the Paris agreement is aiming for and limit warming to 1.5C,” says Ursula Fuentes, a former head of the German government unit responsible for climate policy and strategy. “It’s hard to achieve, but it shows if we have leadership in some countries how fast others can come on board. It also shows Australia needs to start talking about an economic transformation, and introducing policies that will support that transformation, or it will be left behind.” ‘The tide is turning’ While the three countries are yet to spell out in detail how they will reach their targets, the economic ramifications for Australia are vast. Together, the trio buys 75% of Australia’s shipped thermal coal used in power generation, 50% of the coking coal used in steel production, and 87% of its liquefied natural gas (LNG). Analysts say it raises at least two significant questions for the Morrison government. Will it become a pariah on climate change, increasingly diplomatically isolated and seen as unwilling to pull its weight? Perhaps even more importantly, will it plan for an inevitable economic transition before fossil fuel industries, and the national economy, are mugged by reality? The Morrison government’s position until now has been that climate change is a serious global problem that needs a global solution and that – despite significant evidence to the contrary – Australia was playing its part. But rather than applaud it, its response to the news that some of the world’s biggest emitters were promising to do more was to assert its sovereignty: it would not bow to pressure to live up to the commitments it made in Paris. The pushback was both public and private. In a call on Tuesday night, Morrison turned down his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, when asked to sign up to a 2050 net zero commitment. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found in 2018, in a report commissioned as part of the Paris agreement, that reaching net zero emissions by about this date was a necessary part of responding to the climate emergency. But Morrison told Johnson Australia would not agree to that goal for itself. Sources familiar with the call said he instead asked the British leader to back Australia’s approach of setting goals to lower the cost for clean technology, which is tied to neither a timeframe or an emissions reduction plan. Johnson said he would consider it, but the press release his office issued after the meeting emphasised the importance of setting ambitious emissions targets and reaching net zero. In the Senate estimates hearings that have dominated parliament over the past fortnight, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, repeatedly declined to say Australia welcomed Japan and South Korea signing up to net zero despite ostensibly wanting the world to reach that goal. Like many of the government’s claims on climate, the inconsistency went unexplained. The gap between Australia and its major trading partners was emphasised in a report by a centre-right thinktank, the Blueprint Institute, linked to former Liberal ministers Robert Hill and Christopher Pyne, which warned not committing to net zero emissions by 2050 would hurt the country’s international standing and economic competitiveness. It said if ambition on climate was not increased soon “the decision may be forced upon us”. “For a time, we’ve been able to trail behind our peers with little consequence for us or global temperatures,” the report said. “But the tide is turning.” Britain has been urging countries to ramp up commitments since it was announced it would host the next major climate conference in Glasgow, now delayed until late next year. It has been pushing countries on two issues – a mid-century net zero target and to stop financing coal plants in the developing world. Along with the UN, France, Chile and Italy, it will host an online climate summit in December to mark the fifth anniversary celebration of the Paris deal and push for greater action. Only countries that come armed with increased commitments will be invited to speak. That is expected to include China, which officials hope will use it to flesh out the ambitious short-term goals scientists advise are needed, but not Australia. Economic opportunity beckons The announcement by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at the UN general assembly in September that the country’s carbon dioxide emissions would peak before 2030 and it would reach carbon neutrality before 2060 took many by surprise. China is by far the world’s biggest annual emitter – responsible for about half global coal use – and turning around its economy will be a massive task. But it has been working up to this moment, having modelled what a plan to limit warming to 1.5C would like last year. Observers believe it is a serious show of intent from Xi, motivated in part by a desire to move ahead of a possible Joe Biden US presidency, rather than risk pressure from a joint US-Europe push on climate in 2021. Just as important a driver, though, is the economic opportunity presented by the inevitable low-emissions transition. Ben Caldecott, the director of the Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme and a leading voice in the British push for greater global action, says it is “completely in China’s interest to go down this path”. He points out that the International Energy Agency, often criticised for its conservatism in forecasting the development of renewable energy, recently described solar power as the cheapest form of electricity in history. China is expected to include a climate focus, possibly including targets to cap coal use and lifting renewables, in its five-year economic plan due before the end of the year. “These countries are all vying to shape their own and the world’s economic future,” Caldecott says. “The technology is becoming cheaper and cheaper and cheaper, and change is happening and not going to stop. The question is just: ‘what’s the plan?’” The announcement by Japan, the world’s fifth biggest emitter, was just as surprising, and heavily influenced by the Chinese commitment. The new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, used his first parliamentary policy speech since taking office to declare the climate crisis was no longer a constraint on economic growth, but an opportunity to be seized. Japan is heavily reliant on energy imports – it is Australia’s biggest market for both thermal coal and LNG – and under Suga’s predecessor, Shinzo Abe, was seen as a recalcitrant player on climate. It continued to support new coal power as other developed countries stopped. But the country is also investing heavily in large offshore wind farms and trialling the use of green ammonia, created with renewable energy, as a replacement fuel in a coal plant. Llewelyn Hughes, an associate dean at the Australian National University’s College of Asia and the Pacific and an expert on Japan, says the 2050 goal is significant as it sets the direction for government agencies and businesses as they consider future policies and viable investments. Already, a number of planned coal plants in Japan have been cancelled, and it will become much harder for others to win finance. It is expected a new three-yearly energy plan, to be released in the middle of next year, will back a greater share of renewables compared with coal and gas. Both Japan and South Korea, which this week confirmed it would take steps to end its coal dependence and back a multibillion-dollar green new deal, are eyeing a future that includes green hydrogen – an industry the Morrison government hopes to develop, though it is also potentially backing hydrogen made with fossil fuels, a step some countries are bypassing. The rush of major Asian powers to sign up to net zero follows similar commitments from other countries and particularly the EU, which is weighing a target of up to a 60% cut by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, and will consider a proposal on carbon border tariffs – which would add a cost at the border to carbon-intensive goods – next year. The sense of momentum will kick into overdrive if Biden, who has promised to sign up to net zero, invest $2tn in clean solutions over four years and take an active role in global climate leadership, defeats Donald Trump in the US presidential election. One diplomatic source said Australia would “be supremely isolated” on climate and come under significant pressure to change its stance if Biden wins. Bill Hare, a longtime advisor to developing countries on climate and the chief executive of Climate Analytics, agrees – that if Australia continues on its current path it risks being left sitting with nations that openly refuse to act, such as Brazil and Saudi Arabia. But he says the country should be particularly concerned about the economic fallout. “The reality is the transition away from coal and then gas is going to happen much faster than Scott Morrison or the Labor party thinks, and it’s going to be extremely disruptive,” he says. “The workforce will be stranded. That’s why what is going on in Australia is so irresponsible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/may/20/dont-despair-about-the-climate-emergency-coal-is-not-the-future","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-19T18:00:11Z","webTitle":"Don’t despair about the climate emergency.

Coal is not the future","bodyText":"It’s going to be hard for those who care about and work on climate change but we must dust ourselves off, because neither despair nor emigrating to New Zealand will help solve the mess Australia’s climate policy is in. The government has been re-elected with a minimalist climate policy and a weak emissions target, despite widespread community support for action on climate change. Where to from here? The near term looks grim. The Coalition government will feel locked into its stance against climate action, even if many smart heads in government will understand that a do-nothing approach is unwise. The Labor party might feel that its progressive stance on climate change hurt it. Tax policy might have swung the election, but climate change clearly played a role. But climate policy will not be stuck there, even if it is a slow and hard road. There are strong international pressures, most of the Australian business community does not want the economy stuck in the past, and the states will not accept a vacuum on climate and energy policy. The world has started the transition to a low-carbon energy and industrial system. Australia’s best bet is to make use of our tremendous opportunities for low-carbon energy production. Hanging on for grim death to the high-carbon industries of the last century is no economic strategy. The world will not carve out a niche for Australia to continue prospering as a 20th-century style high carbon economy. Global demand for coal will fall. The future for our energy industries is in cheap renewable energy. All that before we even consider our country’s vital interest in a strong global climate effort. We are on the frontline of climate change impacts. Meanwhile in our public and political debate, obfuscation and scaremongering must not win out over analysis and strategy. We need a real national conversation about what role Australia can play in the low-carbon economy of the future. We need to understand where the economic opportunities lie, we need a blueprint for a low-carbon energy and industrial system to encourage investors. And we will need to support the regions and communities where economic activity will dry up, particularly coal regions. Why are we not getting there? Tony Abbott put the finger on it in his concession speech after losing his seat in parliament. “Where climate change is a moral issue we Liberals do it tough. But where climate change is an economic issue we do very well,” said the man who gained the prime ministership by stoking fear about a carbon tax. In electorates that are not affluent, fear about cuts to income are potent. Labor focused on strong ambition for climate outcomes but did not talk much about how to achieve it, or the costs and benefits. It got stung by shoddy claims that a strong emissions target would be very costly, to which Labor did not have a good answer. Cutting emissions can be achieved with low economic cost and some direct benefits, even before considering climate damages avoided. Wind and solar power are now by far the cheapest ways to produce electricity from newly built plants in Australia. A sensible policy would be to facilitate the rapid investment in renewables, guide an orderly exit from coal, and encourage industry to move to zero-carbon energy sources. Various state governments see it that way. If the do-nothing approach prevails, the national electricity market will continue to be in a mess. More coal power stations will exit suddenly when old equipment fails. Replacement investment in renewables and storage will not be ready, causing power prices to shoot up like they did after the closure of Hazelwood. Without a low-carbon roadmap, money spent ensuring reliability of the grid will not be what is needed long term. The federal government may again be tempted to subsidise the refurbishment of old coal plants, and to lavish coal subsidies on Queensland. The incumbent energy industries will see their profits will remain high. Consumers, energy-using businesses and taxpayers will pay the bill, and emissions will be unnecessarily high. With effective policy, things could be very different. Australia could meet practically all of its energy use from solar and wind power. We could use green electricity and renewables-based hydrogen in industry and in transport. We could build up an industry that produces green hydrogen, ammonia, aluminium and steel for export to countries who are less fortunate than Australia in their endowment with renewable energy opportunities. Those industries could grow larger than the coal and gas industry now is. They could last indefinitely and help the world decarbonise. To the many people in Australia who care deeply about climate change and dedicate some of their life to finding solutions, the election outcome will seem like a hard blow. But do not despair, do not retreat. Continue your work, with objectivity, integrity and dedication. Countries that produce and export large amounts of fossil fuels have an uphill battle for forward looking policy on climate. But the opportunities in the global shift to clean energy are compelling, and coal is not the future. Let’s insist on having that national conversation. • Frank Jotzo is the director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/live/2022/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-says-only-diplomacy-can-end-war-polish-president-to-address-ukraine-parliament-in-kyiv-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T00:00:23Z","webTitle":"Airstrikes target Mykolaiv and Donbas regions; Ukraine EU bid could take 20 years, says French minister – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-says-only-diplomacy-can-end-war-polish-president-to-address-ukraine-parliament-in-kyiv-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-says-only-diplomacy-can-end-war-polish-president-to-address-ukraine-parliament-in-kyiv-live","fields":{"headline":"Airstrikes target Mykolaiv and Donbas regions; Ukraine EU bid could take 20 years, says French minister – as it happened","bodyText":"This blog will be closing soon but please join us in a few hours time when we will relaunch our live coverage. In the meantime, here’s a roundup of the latest developments: Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region. “The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak. The comments came as Russia said it was willing to resume peace negotiations, Russia’s lead negotiator said Sunday, but the initiative to continue them is with Kyiv. Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky claimed in an interview with Belarusian TV that “Russia has never refused talks”. Polish president Andrzej Duda became the first foreign leader to address the Ukrainian parliament in person since the invasion began, backing Ukraine’s stance on territorial concessions and warning the international community that ceding any territory to Russia would be a “huge blow” to the entire West. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that 50 to 100 Ukrainians were dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region. Ukraine is set to top the agenda at the four-day World Economic Forum, which kicks off on Monday with a video address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. This year Russia’s “house” at the event was transformed into a “Russian War Crimes House”, portraying images of misery and devastation. UK prime minister Boris Johnson spoke with Zelenskiy about Russia’s blockade of Odesa, Ukraine’s largest shipping port. The blockade of Ukraine’s ports has been a growing concern for world leaders as many continue to warn about global food security, in particular for developing countries. The Moscow-installed mayor of Enerhodar, a southern city of Ukraine and the location of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has been wounded in an explosion. Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that Andrey Shevchik was in intensive care. A bid by Ukraine to join the European Union would not be finalised for “15 or 20 years,” France’s Europe minister said. “We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you’re lying. It’s probably in 15 or 20 years, it takes a long time,” Clément Beaune said. Zelenskiy has extended Ukraine’s martial law for three months through to 23 August. Ukraine’s parliament also banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine but agreed to Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes. Olena Zelenska has given a rare interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, only their second public appearance together since Russia launched its invasion. She recounts the “anxiety and stupor” she felt on 24 February, and says that even though she has barely seen her husband since “no one, not even the war, could take him away” from her. Technicians linked to the Syrian military’s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for a similar campaign in the Ukraine war, European officials believe. Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from Vladimir Putin’s military. YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”. Ukraine’s parliament on Sunday banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine but agreed to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes, Reuters reports. Yaroslav Zheleznyak, an opposition member, announced the decision on the Telegram messaging app, saying 313 deputies had voted in favour in the 423-member Verkhovna Rada assembly. Zelenskiy had vetoed an earlier version of the bill and called for the two symbols to be allowed in displays in museums, libraries, scientific works, re-enactments, textbooks and similar instances. Neither of the two letters exists in the Russian alphabet. They have been widely used, particularly on Russian military vehicles and equipment, to promote the aims of the conflict. The new bill bans the creation of non-governmental organisations using Russian war symbols or undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty. The Ukrainian parliament on Sunday also extended for another 90 days, or until 23 August, the period of martial law in the country. Hello, this is Helen Livingstone taking over the blog from my colleague Vivian Ho. Ukrainian-Polish relations are “finally on a completely clean, sincere basis, without any quarrels and old conflict heritage,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest nightly address after welcoming Polish president Andrzej Duda to Kyiv. In recognition of a law in Poland that gives Ukrainians the same opportunities as Poles, Zelenskiy said Ukraine was preparing a similar bill in Ukraine for Poles. Let it be so that the citizens of Poland will never have to use such a law. But let us show our gratitude and our respect. And I also want it to be part of our new neighborhood policy. We must resolve disputes and remove the pressure of the past from our current relations with all Ukraine’s neighbors who respect us and are not occupiers of our state. He also said a new decision to introduce joint customs controls with Poland was “revolutionising” the countries’ border and was a step towards Ukraine’s entry into the European Union. This will significantly speed up border procedures. It will remove most of the corruption risks. But it is also the beginning of our integration into the common customs space of the European Union. That is a truly historical process. He also said he had spoken to UK prime minister Boris Johnson to discuss ways of increasing exports, especially agricultural products, and increasing fuel imports to Ukraine. It is 1:30am in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that with the fighting in the eastern region, Ukraine may lose up to 100 soldiers a day. A Russian attack on Malyn, a city in the Zhytomyr oblast, has killed at least one person, according to the governor of the oblast. After Manchester City won the Premier League title, Ukrainian player Oleksandr Zinchenko wrapped the Ukrainian flag around the trophy in an emotional scene. Russia is willing to resume peace negotiations, Russia’s lead negotiator said Sunday, but the initiative to continue them is with Kyiv. Boris Johnson, prime minister of the UK, spoke with Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday evening about Russia’s blockade of Odesa, Ukraine’s largest shipping port. At this year’s World Economic Forum, Ukrainian artists have dressed up the space that would have been the Russia house showcasing Russian business leaders and investors as on the main street of Davos in Switzerland as instead a Russian War Crimes House. In the settlement of Staryi Krym outside Mariupol, the dirt lays fresh on far too many newly made graves. Typically at the World Economic Forum, Russia would have its own house to showcase its business leaders and investors. This year, Reuters is reporting that Ukrainian artists have dressed up the space on the main street of Davos in Switzerland as a Russian War Crimes House. “This is a place where all influencers and all decision-makers of the world come together,” the artistic director of Kyiv’s PinchukArtCentre, Bjorn Geldhof, told Reuters TV. “What is happening in Ukraine will define tomorrow.” Boris Johnson, prime minister of the UK, spoke with Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday evening about Russia’s blockade of Odesa, Ukraine’s largest shipping port, Reuters is reporting. The blockade of Ukraine’s ports has been a growing concern for world leaders as many continue to warn about global food security, in particular for developing countries. Before the invasion in February, Ukraine was known as the bread basket of Europe, exporting 4.5m tonnes of agricultural produce a month through its ports – 12% of global wheat supply, 15% of corn and half of sunflower oil. Last week, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, accused Russia of “using food as a weapon” with its blockade of ports. In Kharkiv, some residents displaced by Russian shelling had been living underground for months in a metro station. Today, they had to leave – authorities plan to restart the subway system this week and are providing temporary housing for those made homeless in student dormitories. Some scenes from around Ukraine today: Russia is willing to resume peace negotiations, Russia’s lead negotiator said Sunday, but the initiative to continue them is with Kyiv. The Associated Press is reporting that Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky said in an interview with Belarusian TV that “Russia has never refused talks”. “For our part, we are ready to continue the dialogue,” Medinsky said. “Freezing talks was entirely Ukraine’s initiative,” Medinsky said, adding that the “ball is completely in their court”. Talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations have been held regularly both in person and via video link since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. In March, the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers met for inconclusive talks in Turkey, followed by a meeting of the delegations in Istanbul, which also failed to bring about concrete results. On Tuesday, Kyiv’s lead negotiator Mykhaylo Podolyak said that talks with Moscow were “on hold”. After Manchester City won the Premier League title, Ukrainian player Oleksandr Zinchenko wrapped the Ukrainian flag around the trophy and got emotional: A Russian attack on Malyn, a city in the Zhytomyr oblast, has killed at least one person, according to the governor of the oblast. Tymofiy Seidov, 8, was the last child left behind in Kutuzivka, a ruined village in north-eastern Ukraine. For 87 days, he lived with 23 others in the almost pitch black 40-by-five-meter basement below the ruins of two-story kindergarten and medical center. When a benefactor read about his family’s plight in the Guardian this week, he got the chance to leave the bomb shelter for the first time in three months and escape to safety. Instead of relief to finally to see the sky once again, however, Tymofiy responded with fear. “He kept telling me, ‘Mum, let’s go back inside, Mum, let’s hide, Mum, let’s not be out in the open,’” said his mother, Rita Sotnikova. Read more here: The Moscow-installed mayor of Enerhodar, a southern city of Ukraine and the location of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, was wounded in an explosion Sunday, AFP is reporting. Andrey Shevchik was appointed mayor of Enerhodar after Russian troops took control of the city and the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. “We have accurate confirmation that during the explosion the self-proclaimed head of the ‘people’s administration’ Shevchik and his bodyguards were injured,” Dmytro Orlov, the elected mayor of Enerhodar, said on Telegram. Orlov said that they were in hospital “with injuries of varying severity”, but nobody else was injured in the blast. Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that Shevchik was in intensive care. Ukraine may lose up to 100 soldiers a day fighting in the eastern region, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Sunday. In a bit of lighter news, the National Opera of Ukraine raised its curtain in Kyiv for the first time since Russian forces invaded in February. An update on an earlier story that a Russian who was appointed head of an occupied Ukrainian town was injured in an explosion on Sunday (see 15:17) Andrei Shevchik, named mayor of Enerhodar by Russian after its invasion and subsequent occupation, was in intensive care after the blast according to Russia’s RIA news agency. Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of the town recognised by Ukraine said on Sunday night that Shevchik had been taken to the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol to recover, and that he would be temporarily replaced as leader of the town. My colleague Lorenzo Tondo has been speaking to the lawyer who is representing the Russian soldier in court after being charged with committing war crimes. Defending a Russian soldier accused of a war crime in Ukraine is no easy task, which is why some people have described Viktor Ovsyannikov as “the devil’s advocate”. But the 43-year-old Ukrainian is unrepentant. “First of all, I am defending a person, not a crime,” Ovsyannikov said on Sunday on the eve of the verdict in the trial of 21-year-old tank commander Vadim Shysimarin, who has already pleaded guilty to killing an an unarmed civilian in late February. “I’m trying to prove that my defendant’s actions were misqualified. It’s up to judges to decide. I just do my job.” “My family, friends and colleagues support me,” Ovsyannikov added. “They know someone has to do it. But there are other people who ‘invited’ me to go to Moscow or Donbas [the area in eastern Ukraine claimed by Russia-backed separatists.” A sea of flags mark graves of dead soldiers at a Kharkiv cemetery. The graveyard in Bezliudivka, on the outskirts of Ukraine’s second city has had a military section for several years. However, it has been burying soldiers since the invasion began in February. More were laid to rest on Saturday, according to Agence France Presse. Flags have been planted, one for each grave. Two coffins placed on trestles belonged to soldiers who were killed in Vilkhivka, to the east of Kharkiv. Their dates of death were given as 11 May, but the likelihood is that this was when their bodies were found. “They were found with five other bodies that we couldn’t identify,” said one soldier, who spoke on condition he was not identified. “We suspect they were executed,” he added. “They were killed by bullets to the back of the head.” The conflict in Ukraine is making its mark at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Normally Russia would have a presence, but this year a space on the main street in the town in Switzerland has been turned into a Russian War Crimes House by Ukrainian artists, Reuters reports. It depicts images of misery and devastation caused by the Russian invasion, which began in February. Russia denies allegations of war crimes. The conflict is the top of the agenda for the four-day meeting of global business leaders, which will begin on Monday with a video address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Russian institutions are absent, as well as its politicians, executives and academics. Parties once hosted by state banks, private companies and its sovereign wealth fund are nowhere to be seen. A bid by Ukraine to join the European Union would not be finalised for “15 or 20 years,” France’s Europe minister said on Sunday. Clément Beaune told Radio J: We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you’re lying. It’s probably in 15 or 20 years, it takes a long time. Beaune reiterated an offer by French president Emmanuel Macron to create a looser “European political community” that could help integrate Ukraine with the bloc sooner, as reported by AFP. However, that offer has received a cold welcome from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who on Saturday denounced “such compromises” and insisted on an immediate start of the process towards full EU membership. A Russian-appointed mayor of a Ukrainian occupied town was injured in an explosion on Sunday. Andrei Shevchik was appointed mayor of Enerhodar following the Russian army’s occupation of the town, Reuters reported. Shevchuk is in intensive care following the attack, according to a report from Russia’s RIA news agency, citing a source in the emergency services. Dmytro Orlov, who Ukraine recognises as mayor of the town said in a post on the Telegram messaging app: We have accurate confirmation that during the explosion the self-proclaimed head of the ‘people’s administration’ Shevchik and his bodyguards were injured. Enerhodar has a population of more than 50,000 and many of the residents work at the two power plants located next to the town, one of which is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power station in Europe. YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”. The platform is hugely popular in Russia, where, unlike some of its US peers, it has not been shut down despite hosting content from opposition figures such as Alexei Navalny. YouTube has also been able to operate in Russia despite cracking down on pro-Kremlin content that has broken guidelines including its major violent events policy, which prohibits denying or trivialising the invasion. Since the conflict began in February, YouTube has taken down channels including that of the pro-Kremlin journalist Vladimir Solovyov. Channels associated with Russia’s ministries of defence and foreign affairs have also been temporarily suspended from uploading videos in recent months for describing the war as a “liberation mission”. Read more: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has extended the country’s martial law for three months through to 22 August 22. Zelenskiy first signed the decree along with a general military mobilisation call on 24 February when Russian forces invaded. Ukraine’s parliament on Sunday voted by an absolute majority for the third extension of the decree as Russia pursues its offensive targeting the eastern Donbas region, reports AFP. Olena Zelenska has given a rare interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, only their second public appearance together since Russia launched its invasion. She recounts the “anxiety and stupor” she felt on 24 February, and says that even though she has barely seen her husband since “no one, not even the war, could take him away” from her. My colleague Isobel Koshiw is reporting from Zhytomyr region, which shares a border with Belarus. She reports: Ukrainian forces have built a new line of defences along the country’s previously unfortified northern border with Belarus amid signs of another attack. Russian forces invaded Ukraine through the Belarusian border in February when they tried to capture the capital, Kyiv. On 10 May, Belarus’s army chief, Viktor Gulevich, announced the deployment of Belarusian special forces and equipment in response to what he described as a “southern threat” from Ukraine and Nato. Belarus has been conducting military drills on its border with Ukraine since early May. The Belarusian president, Aleksandr Lukashenko, has been Russia’s closest ally in its war in Ukraine. On Tuesday, Lukashenko urged the Russian-led military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, which met in Moscow, to remain united on Ukraine and accused the west of prolonging the conflict.

He said: “I will not rest until Ukraine becomes a member of the European Union.” Technicians linked to the Syrian military’s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for a similar campaign in the Ukraine war, European officials believe. Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists, all with vast experience in making and delivering the crude explosive, have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from Vladimir Putin’s military. Their arrival is understood to be one factor behind US and European warnings that the Russian military may have been preparing for the use of chemical weapons in the conflict, which has entered its fourth month with little sign of slowing. Read more here: Here is everything you might have missed: Russian airstrikes hit Ukrainian forces in the Mykolaiv and Donbas regions, targeting command centres, troops, and ammunition depots, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, spokesperson for the defence ministry, said air-launched missiles hit three command points and four ammunition depots in the Donbas, Reuters reported. In Ukraine’s southern region of Mykolaiv, Russian rockets struck a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka, about 100km north-east of Mykolaiv city, Konashenkov said. Ukraine’s Severodonetsk is one of Russia’s ‘immediate tactical priorities’, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said on Sunday. The city of Severodonetsk in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region is one of Russia’s “immediate tactical priorities” as its forces deploy terminator tanks to the area, the MoD has said. The latest intelligence report, released at 7am BST, said: “Russia’s only operational company of BMP-T Terminator tank support vehicles has likely been deployed to the Severodonetsk axis of the Donbas offensive. Their presence suggests that the Central Grouping of Forces (CGF) is involved in this attack, which is the only formation fielding this vehicle. CGF previously suffered heavy losses while failing to break through to eastern Kyiv in the first phase of the invasion.Russia developed Terminator after identifying the need to provide dedicated protection to main battle tanks it used during the Afghan and Chechen wars.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia of blocking export of 22m tonnes of food. The Ukrainian president also said that an energy crisis would swiftly follow a food crisis if Ukraine was not given help to unlock its ports. The city of Severodonetsk has been attacked from ‘four separate directions’, says region’s governor. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city, despite targeting it from four different directions. Only Ukraine has the right to decide its future, the Polish president told lawmakers in Kyiv on Sunday. Andrzej Duda said:”Worrying voices have appeared, saying that Ukraine should give in to Putin’s demands. Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future … nothing about you without you. Duda became the first foreign leader to give a speech in person to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia’s invasion. Russia’s state gas company, Gazprom, halted gas exports to Finland, which refused Moscow’s demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after western countries imposed sanctions over the invasion. Gasum, Finland’s state-owned energy company, said it would use other sources, such as the Balticconnector pipeline, which links Finland to fellow EU member Estonia. Ukraine has suggested it is willing to resume talks with Russia. Speaking on Saturday, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that “discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place … under what format I don’t know … but the war will be bloody, there will be fighting and [it] will only definitively end through diplomacy.” He added: “We want everything back. And the Russian Federation doesn’t want to return anything. That’s why the ending will be at the negotiating table.” However, Kyiv has ruled out a ceasefire or concessions to Moscow. Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Kyiv would not accept any deal with Russia that involved ceding territory. “Any concession to Russia is not a path to peace, but a war postponed for several years. Ukraine trades neither its sovereignty, nor territories and Ukrainians living on them,” he said in a video posted to Twitter on Saturday. Making concessions would backfire on Ukraine because Russia would hit back harder after any break in fighting, he added. “The war will not stop [after concessions]. It will just be put on pause for some time. They’ll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale.” Russia claims to have taken full control of the besieged city of Mariupol. The last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the smashed Azovstal steelworks have surrendered, Russia’s defence ministry said late on Friday, marking an end to the three-month siege of the defenders’ last stronghold in Mariupol. “Underground structures of Azovstal where militants were hiding are now under full control of Russian armed forces,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that in total 2,439 Ukrainian fighters have surrendered. Moscow is considering giving up Ukraine fighters captured in Mariupol for Viktor Medvedchuk, a detained ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin. “We are going to study the possibility,” said Leonid Slutsky, a senior member of Russia’s negotiating team on Ukraine, speaking from the separatist city of Donetsk in south-eastern Ukraine, Russian state media agency RIA Novosti reported. Zelenskiy described the situation in Donbas as “extremely difficult” in his latest national address, adding that the Russian army is trying to attack Slovyansk and Severodonetsk, a frontline city now at risk of encirclement where 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling, regional governor Sergiy Gaiday said. Germany’s reliance on Russian gas is providing a backdrop for chancellor Olaf Scholz’s first trip to Africa. He is embarking on a three-day tour of Senegal, Niger and South Africa kicking off on Sunday. The first stop on Scholz’s trip is Senegal, which has billions of cubic metres of gas reserves and is expected to become a major gas producer in the region. Germany is seeking to reduce its heavy reliance on Russia for gas following the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. It could help explore a gas field in Senegal, a government official said on Friday. The source told Reuters that Scholz also wanted to discuss possible cooperation on the development of renewable energy. In Senegal, he will visit a solar power plant after meeting and holding a joint news conference with the country’s President Macky Sall. Germany has invited both Senegal, which holds the rotating chairmanship of the African Union, and South Africa to attend the G7 summit it is hosting in June as guest countries. Puppies evacuated from war-torn Kharkiv as fighting increases – video Only Ukraine has the right to decide its future, the Polish president told lawmakers in Kyiv on Sunday. Andrzej Duda said: Worrying voices have appeared, saying that Ukraine should give in to Putin’s demands. Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future … nothing about you without you. Duda became the first foreign leader to give a speech in person to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia’s invasion. It is a 10-minute drive from Serhi Belyaev’s house in the village of Tsyrkuny to his fiancee’s home in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. A quick spin west on Soborna Street, over the E40 motorway on to the Lesia Serduika highway, and you are there. That was, until the war came. It took just hours for Russian forces to sweep into Belyaev’s village on 24 February, as they advanced on Kharkiv, the closest major Ukrainian city to the Russian border. Lives across Ukraine were changed that morning. For Belyaev, the frontline of the largest conflict in Europe since the second world war now lay between him and both his girlfriend, Nataliy Drozd, 28, and his parents. No longer the familiar road into town, Lesia Serduika was now an impassable no man’s land. Belyaev was cut off, worried for his sick mother, Galina, 66, and determined to be with his terrified girlfriend. Then Belyaev, 32, a professional poker player, had an idea. A gamble. He mused on it, initially rejected it and then settled on it. He would replace the 10km drive with a 3,700km odyssey. Read the rest of this incredible story by Daniel Boffey below: The latest updated map from the Ministry of Defence on the situation in Ukraine: Russia attacked Ukrainian forces with airstrikes and artillery in the east and the south, targeting command centres, troops, and ammunition depots, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, spokesperson for the defence ministry, said air-launched missiles hit three command points and four ammunition depots in the Donbas, Reuters reported. In Ukraine’s southern region of Mykolaiv, Russian rockets struck a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka, about 100km north-east of Mykolaiv city, Konashenkov said. He added: Rockets and artillery hit 583 areas where troops and Ukrainian military equipment amassed, 41 control points, 76 artillery and mortar units in firing positions, including three Grad batteries, as well as a Bukovel Ukrainian electronic warfare station near the settlement of Hannivka, Mykolaiv region. The Ukrainian president also said that an energy crisis would swiftly follow a food crisis if Ukraine was not given help to unlock its ports. After a meeting with Portuguese prime minister António Costa on Saturday, he told the media: The world community must help Ukraine unblock seaports, otherwise the energy crisis will be followed by a food crisis and many more countries will face it. Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food – our grain, barley, sunflower and more. A lot of things. There will be a crisis in the world. The second crisis after the energy one, which was provoked by Russia. Now it will create a food crisis if we do not unblock the routes for Ukraine, do not help the countries of Africa, Europe, Asia, which need these food products. He added that one way to unblock the ports would be via a military solution that would involve procuring further weapons from allies. Why do Finland and Sweden want to join Nato? Severodonetsk has been attacked from ‘four separate directions’, says region’s governor. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city, despite targeting it from four different directions. On the Telegram messaging app, he said: The Russians tried to enter Sievierodonetsk from 4 directions at once, but they were repelled and retreated to their earlier positions. However, they continued to shell residential neighbourhoods with mortars and artillery. Almost every Ukrainian-controlled town and village sustained damage. On Friday, Haidai said that a school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region. Neither of these accounts could be independently verified. The city of Severodonetsk was earlier on Saturday morning described as one of Russia’s “immediate tactical priorities”, the UK Ministry of Defence said. Gazprom halts gas exports to Finland Russia’s state gas company, Gazprom, said it has halted gas exports to Finland. The country refused Moscow’s demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after western countries imposed sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum, the Finnish government and individual gas-consuming companies in the country have said they were prepared for a shutdown of Russian flows, Reuters reported. Most European supply contracts are denominated in euros or dollars. Last month, Moscow cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland after they refused to comply with the new terms. Mariupol facing health and sanitation ‘catastrophe’, says mayor The Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol Vadim Boychenko said on Saturday that mass burials in shallow pits across the city and the breakdown of sewage systems could prompt a health crisis. He added that summer rains threaten to contaminate water sources as he pressed Russian forces to allow residents to safely leave the city. In addition to the humanitarian catastrophe created by the (Russian) occupiers and collaborators, the city is on the verge of an outbreak of infectious diseases, he said on the messaging app Telegram. International sanctions have ‘practically broken all’ logistics corridors for trade, Russian transport minister says. Transport minister Vitaly Savelyev said on Saturday that the raft of sanctions imposed by western countries on Russia is causing serious logistical problems in the country. According to state news agency Tass, Savalyev said: The sanctions that have been imposed on the Russian Federation today have practically broken all logistics [corridors] in our country. And we are forced to look for new logistics corridors together. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Joe Middleton and now taking over from Samantha Lock to bring you the latest developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The city of Severodonetsk in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region is one of Russia’s “immediate tactical priorities” as its forces deploy terminator tanks to the area, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. The latest intelligence report, released at 7am BST, reads: Russia’s only operational company of BMP-T Terminator tank support vehicles has likely been deployed to the Severodonetsk axis of the Donbas offensive. Their presence suggests that the Central Grouping of Forces (CGF) is involved in this attack, which is the only formation fielding this vehicle. CGF previously suffered heavy losses while failing to break through to eastern Kyiv in the first phase of the invasion. Russia developed Terminator after identifying the need to provide dedicated protection to main battle tanks it used during the Afghan and Chechen wars. The Severodonetsk area remains one of Russia’s immediate tactical priorities. However, with a maximum of 10 Terminators deployed they are unlikely to have a significant impact on the campaign.” Russia on Saturday released a list of 963 Americans it said were banned from entering the country, including US president Joe Biden. The lifetime bans imposed on the Americans, including secretary of state Antony Blinken, US senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, defence secretary Lloyd Austin and CIA head William Burns, are largely symbolic. They came on the same day Biden signed a support package providing nearly $40bn (£32bn) in aid for Ukraine. You can peruse the full list here. Russia has intensified its offensive in the Donbas while its forces advance on the Luhansk front. Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy described the situation in Donbas as “extremely difficult” in his latest national address. The regional governor of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region, Sergiy Gaiday, said Russia is trying to destroy the city of Severodonetsk, with fighting taking place on the outskirts of the city. The frontline city is now at risk of encirclement after 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling, Gaiday added. “Shelling continues from morning to the evening and also throughout the night,” he said in a video post on the Telegram messaging app. Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, the city on the other side of the Siverskiy Donets River, form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture Kyiv. In the neighbouring Donetsk region, governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram on Saturday that seven civilians had been killed and 10 wounded. Further north in Kharkiv, just 50km from the border with Russia, new networks of trenches and checkpoints have cropped up as the city prepares to defend against a fresh assault, according to a Reuters report. Polish president Andrzej Duda is set to deliver a speech to Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada on Sunday, a gesture that will make him the first head of a foreign state to do so since the start of Russia’s invasion. Duda arrived in Kyiv on Saturday and “will deliver the address as the first head of a foreign state since the outbreak of the war”, his office said. Ukraine has suggested it is willing to resume talks with Russia, while ruling out a ceasefire or concessions to Moscow. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said during an interview with the United News telethon on Saturday that “discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place”. I really thought that the war could end with dialogue. But, unfortunately, I thought that this was a dialogue with the appropriate timing, that it would be possible to find answers to many questions and many decisions with the Russian side. I really thought so. And now it is a hybrid. That is why the war is so difficult. And the victory will be very difficult. It will be bloody, it will be in battle, but the end will definitely be in diplomacy. We want everything back. And the Russian Federation doesn’t want to return anything. That’s why the ending will be at the negotiating table. We want the territories back and this war to be over. But how and when it will happen depends on the time when the conversation with Putin will take place. I think that the conversation between Ukraine and Russia will definitely take place. But we don’t know in what format: with or without intermediaries, in a wide circle or in the format of bilateral conversation.” Zelenskiy’s senior adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Kyiv would not accept any deal with Russia that involved ceding territory. He said making concessions would backfire on Ukraine because Russia would hit back harder after any break in fighting. Any concession to Russia is not a path to peace, but a war postponed for several years. Ukraine trades neither its sovereignty, nor territories and Ukrainians living on them.” The war will not stop [after concessions]. It will just be put on pause for some time … They’ll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while before my colleagues in London take the reins a little later. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has suggested he is willing to resume talks with Russia, though his senior advisor, Mykhailo Podolyak, clarified that Kyiv will not accept any deal with Russia that involves ceding territory. Here is everything you might have missed: Ukraine has suggested it is willing to resume talks with Russia. Speaking on Saturday, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that “discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place … under what format I don’t know … but the war will be bloody, there will be fighting and [it] will only definitively end through diplomacy.” He added: “We want everything back. And the Russian Federation doesn’t want to return anything. That’s why the ending will be at the negotiating table.” However, Kyiv has ruled out a ceasefire or concessions to Moscow. Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Kyiv would not accept any deal with Russia that involved ceding territory. “Any concession to Russia is not a path to peace, but a war postponed for several years.

Polish president Andrzej Duda has arrived in Ukraine to address the Ukrainian parliament. Duda arrived in Ukraine on Saturday and will be the first head of a foreign state to deliver a speech to Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada since the start of Russia’s invasion. Russia banned 963 Americans, including president Joe Biden, from entering the country. The list, which also includes the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, US senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, defence secretary Lloyd Austin and CIA head William Burns, is largely symbolic. Biden signed a funding bill that will provide nearly $40bn (£32bn) in aid to Ukraine. Zelenskiy met Portugal’s prime minister, António Costa, and described the meeting as “important and meaningful”. Portugal later announced an agreement to provide €250m ($264m) in financial aid to Ukraine. The Ukraine president also had a phone conversation with Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, and said he stressed the importance of more sanctions on Russia and unblocking Ukrainian ports. Russia destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base near Odesa, Ukraine’s main Black Sea port, as well as a significant cache of western-supplied weapons in northern Zhytomyr region, Russia defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said on Saturday. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side. Turkish president Tayyip Erdoğan, who has objected to Sweden and Finland joining Nato, held phone calls with the leaders of the two countries on Saturday and discussed his concerns about terrorist organisations. Turkey surprised its Nato allies last week by objecting to the two countries’ accession to the military alliance, but western leaders have expressed confidence that Ankara’s objections will not be a roadblock for the membership process. Russia’s state gas company, Gazprom, halted gas exports to Finland, which refused Moscow’s demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after western countries imposed sanctions over the invasion. Gasum, Finland’s state-owned energy company, said it would use other sources, such as the Balticconnector pipeline, which links Finland to fellow EU member Estonia. Canada has imposed sanctions on the Russian-born billionaire and newspaper proprietor Alexander Lebedev. The former KGB agent is the owner of UK newspapers the Evening Standard and the Independent. The world must help Ukraine unblock seaports, otherwise the energy crisis will be followed by a global food crisis, Zelenskiy said. “Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food … There will be a crisis in the world. The second crisis after the energy one, which was provoked by Russia. Now it will create a food crisis.” According to A second meeting of partner countries is set to take place on 23 May at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base. Zelenskiy said he expects Ukraine will be provided with more weapons. “To be honest, we have high expectations. I would call it a long-awaited process. We are grateful for the great military support provided by various states. We expect a positive result on the supply of MLRS,” he said.

The lure of corruption, and the entrenchment of money, is all-encompassing – a rare shared point between America’s two political parties, and a thesis of a film attempting to pull back the curtain on business as usual in Washington. Directors Morgan Pehme and Daniel DiMauro were not strangers to corruption in American politics; the two directed the 2017 documentary Get Me Roger Stone, a film about the Trump campaign consultant who was sentenced to 40 months in prison for corruption charges (Trump commuted his sentence last month). But the two did not expect to find commonality on the issue of corruption in Congress in Drain the Swamp, a book invoking the Trump slogan by a co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus, Colorado representative Ken Buck. The duo, self-described liberals, read the first seven or so chapters and were surprised to find themselves thinking, “we’re on the same page with this conservative member of the Freedom Caucus about how the rich donors and special interests are controlling and perverting our government,” Pehme told the Guardian. Then they got to the chapter on Buck’s argument for the end of the Endangered Species Act, and it was, “Oh, right, we’re not on the same page with you at all.” Still, the near-overlap with progressive calls from the likes of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to cleanse Washington of big-money donors seemed like a window into the deliberately opaque and confusing world of congressional fundraising. Filming Buck and two fellow Republican lawmakers – Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Matt Gaetz of Florida in their DC offices, at their homes, at campaign stops and constituent visits – could offer “a chance to take the American public behind closed doors in Congress for the first time and show them how the sausage is made”, said Pehme. They began filming The Swamp in 2019 with an understanding of money’s corrosive role in representative democracy, especially in the near-decade since the Citizens United v FEC decision by the supreme court uncapped donations by large political groups known as Super Pacs. But the chokehold of money “was just so much worse than we could have imagined”, DiMauro told the Guardian. “Our objective was not to weasel our way into these Republican offices so that we could secretly undermine them,” said Pehme, a former political journalist. Rather, it was “to get the American people behind closed doors so they could see for themselves why the system is broken”. The Swamp follows Massie, Buck and in particular Gaetz over the course of one turbulent year, as the lawmakers navigate a thicket of corrupting influences: the fundraising requirements by the National Republican Congressional Committee (and likewise by its Democratic counterpart, the DCCC) which incentivize endless campaigning; the party systems which attach a fundraising hierarchy to committee assignments – the more money raised, the more influential the seat; the necessity of media notoriety to win some independence from reliance of so-called Political Action Committee (Pac) money; the “threat value of money”, as explained by Harvard law professor and lone academic talking head Lawrence Lessig, that could be revoked in campaigns by corporations unhappy with legislation, which “has the effect of disciplining members of Congress”, especially on anti-industry issues such as fossil fuel regulation. All three legislators decry, in public and on camera, the poisonous vines of financial incentives in Washington; all three also embody striking hypocrisies in staking their positions. Gaetz, the most notorious of the three for his friendship with Donald Trump, became the first Republican congressman to swear off Pac money in his campaigns in February, but derives much of visibility from his unwavering chumminess with a president whose administration tapped four times more lobbyists in two years than the Obama administration did in six. Gaetz represents what DiMauro called “the double-edged sword” of visibility required to make swearing off business donations helpful in meeting fundraising quotas (for Gaetz, at one point, $125,000 for the NRCC) viable. He breaks free by trafficking in what Lessig calls “the politics of hate” – drumming up “bloodsport” conflict with the opposing party to drive emotions, and thus more fundraising. “He’s able to create his own national platform by being so polarizing,” said DiMauro. In October 2019, Gaetz corralled several Republican lawmakers into crashing a closed-door impeachment inquiry committee hearing in the Capitol basement as Laura Cooper, a top Pentagon official for Ukraine policy, prepared to testify. The scene, as captured by Pehme and DiMauro and a mass of news cameras, is chaotic and absurd – lawmakers hyped with game-time energy, wielding cellphones, accessing a secured room and then ordering pizza; the stunt violated confidentiality rules, jeopardized the security of proceedings and blared across cable news. “The fact that it became such a big story shows how the media rewards the theater of the absurd,” said Pehme. “That was mission accomplished for Matt Gaetz, because he turned the story away from the depositions that were taking place in the Scif [sensitive compartmented information facility] to this false claim that the Republicans were being shut out of the process.” The film, and its makers, are careful not to lay the blame exclusively at the feet of the Republican party; the Democrats have a similar system for allotting committee seats by fundraising levels, and require member dues (which were recently boycotted by Ocasio-Cortez, who instead promised to pay the money directly to Democrats in tough races). On the party level, “there is no interest in bridging the partisan divide, because they use it is as fuel for their money machines to keep themselves in power,” said Pehme. “But I do feel that there is an opportunity to bridge the divide between members of different parties.” That’s partly why, said Pehme, the film focuses in particular on bipartisan support for ending America’s perpetual wars; it’s an admittedly surprising image to see Massie, a staunch fiscal conservative who denies human-produced carbon dioxide’s role in climate change (yet whose house runs entirely on solar power), standing in support behind Barbara Lee, the lone lawmaker to oppose the passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists act (AUMF) in 2001, which expanded executive power under Bush for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Massie joined several Republicans opposed to America’s involvement in cyclical wars to support Lee’s proposal to repeal the AUMF. The Swamp suggests, as the chaos of 2019 lurched into an unfathomable 2020, that special interests in Washington are not withering. Massie supported a war powers resolution restricting Trump’s ability to conduct military action in Iran – a vote in line with his conscience but not his Republican base – and laments his next 90 days “groveling” for campaign money to ward off a primary challenger. Gaetz swore off the Pac money – weeks before the coronavirus pandemic, which triggered a congressional stimulus bill that delivered billions to special interests at the expense of small businesses. If it all seems bleak, the hope, said the film-makers, is change through translating common wisdom – Washington is dysfunctional, we all know that – into clear examples on screen. “If the American people get to see and understand exactly how Congress is corrupt,” Pehme said. “We can come together – Democrats, Republicans, independents – and we can insist that our members stop playing this game.” The Swamp premieres on HBO on 4 August with a UK date to be announced"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/aug/27/morning-mail-teen-arrested-over-kenosha-killings-aged-care-failures-shark-victim-speaks","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-26T21:00:12Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: teen arrested over Kenosha killings, aged care failures, shark victim speaks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/aug/27/morning-mail-teen-arrested-over-kenosha-killings-aged-care-failures-shark-victim-speaks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/aug/27/morning-mail-teen-arrested-over-kenosha-killings-aged-care-failures-shark-victim-speaks","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: teen arrested over Kenosha killings, aged care failures, shark victim speaks","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 27 August. Top stories A 17-year-old is in police custody in the United States after the shooting deaths of two protesters engaging in Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Wisconsin, with the state governor announcing that 500 more national guards will be brought in as street protests entered a third night. Witnesses allege the teenage shooter was part of a “militia” of heavily armed counter-protesters, with footage posted on social media capturing the shooting. The city of Kenosha has been rocked by protests since the shooting of Jacob Blake by police that has left the 29-year-old “fighting for his life”. The two protest victims, a 26-year-old and a 36-year old, both from Wisconsin, have not yet been identified. A failure to implement workforce pandemic plans in privately operated aged care facilities is a major factor behind the devastating rates of Covid-19 among Victorian healthcare workers, the nurses’ union has said, with at least 2,799 professionals infected during the state’s second wave. Only 6% of those affected acquired the disease outside of the workplace, investigations have found – in contrast to government claims that most infections had occurred in the community. Elsewhere, the aged care royal commission has found that the sector would require $621m in funding per year to lift all facilities to “basic standards”, with $3.2bn a year required to reach a sector-wide “high-quality” standard. A health governance report has also slammed Australia’s economic response to Covid-19, arguing it fails to address insecure work, privatised services such as aged care, low housing supply and climate change. And as Greg Jericho writes, the tentative Australian economic recovery appears to have stalled. Russia is preparing to approve a second vaccine against Covid-19 by late September or early October, deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova has announced. Russia’s claims that a first vaccine, called Sputnik V, is already safe and effective has been met with international scepticism, with the Kremlin announcing it will be rolled out to 40,000 during final trials before its international availability. In Croatia, the summer tourism season has been blamed for the Balkan nation recording its highest number of daily coronavirus infections – 358 new cases – while France has recorded 5,429 cases overnight. A new study meanwhile has suggested that obesity increases the chances of dying from Covid-19 by nearly 50%, and could also reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. Australia Staff at RMIT University have expressed concern over millions of dollars of funding going to a blockchain research body – the technology behind cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin – with strong links to the rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs. Financial giant HSBC has teamed up to create what it is calling the world’s largest investment firm dedicated to “natural capital” projects, with a view to helping meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement through “investing in the resilience of nature”. UK Labour has criticised reports that Boris Johnson is preparing to appoint Tony Abbott as a post-Brexit UK trade envoy, with the shadow trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, calling the former prime minister a “Trump-worshipping misogynist”. The world Up to half of the world’s water supply is stolen by agricultural companies and farmers every year, a major international study led by Australian researchers has found. A lack of enforceable punishments has been cited as a key driver of ongoing theft.

But rather than succumb to nightmares, Doyle is now using the encounter to defend sharks and help fundraise for better marine protection, writes Graham Readfearn. The Western Australian town of Kalbarri might be postcard perfect but there’s no jobs. But that could be set to change with a proposal for a mammoth 5,000MW renewable hydrogen export operation. Using a combination of wind and solar power to power the production of hydrogen from seawater – the so-called “green” hydrogen could become a major export for Asian powerhouses like Korea or Japan. And with giants like Siemens circling, Australia is poised to become the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy, writes Royce Kurmelovs. From its onset, the coronavirus pandemic has changed the emotional timbre of everyday interactions, writes Josephine Tovey, “bringing an unexpected vulnerability to exchanges with strangers or acquaintances we wouldn’t usually open up to”. But with heightened openness comes a speedier sense of fatigue, prompting many to retreat to ready, graspable shorthand responses. Australian artist John Nixon was a “curator of perspicacity”.

Across the sands and water sits the RSPB’s Ynys-hir nature reserve (as seen on BBC’s Springwatch), home to lapwings, redshanks and, most dramatically of all, ospreys. A beached boat called The Boy John provides a communal area for campers or funky glamping accommodation. And if you can bear to leave, the beach at Aberdyfi and dunes beyond are magnificent. • From £20 for a two-person tent (maximum 5 people per pitch); hoping to open from early August, smugglerscove.info Fallow Fields Camping, Eastry, Kent There are probably worse things in life than being surrounded by apple and pear orchards in a dip of the North Kent Downs. The owners have gone to town on safety here: so expect a guaranteed 10m space between pitches, extra loos and showers, a twice-daily deep clean and antibacterial foggers. If you want to go fancy, there are 15 furnished bell tents for hire (and two unfurnished if you want to go fancy but with your own gear). Close by the coastal towns of Deal and Ramsgate await exploration with the long sweep of Sandwich Bay between them. • Adult £10-£13, child £7-8, open from 4 July (mostly midweek availability), fallowfieldscamping.com Coastal Valley, Newquay, Cornwall Fresh from an impressive multiple-award haul for 2019/20, Coastal Valley is a sanctuary – once on the site you’ll not see a house or indeed even a car. The silence is filled instead with birdsong and the plashing of a brook. Watergate Bay with its two-mile long sandy beach is within easy hiking distance, or you can take to the South West Coast Path. However, the site’s farm shop is chock-full of locally-produced delicacies and essential supplies if you just want to chill. Measures to keep campers safe include a minimum seven-night stay but that merely saves you from the disappointment of having to leave earlier. • One-week pitch (two adults) £182, opens 4 July, coastalvalley.co.uk Strawfields, West Stowford Barton, Devon Within easy striking distance of Ilfracombe, Woolacombe and the two-mile stretch of sandy beach at Morte Bay, Strawfields is a pleasingly tiny campsite of two cosy little fields, replete with rustic wooden bridges over streams. Capacity has been reduced to eight pitches to enable physical distancing, so you can relax and enjoy the menagerie of four-legged beasts that live here, including alpacas, pygmy goats, Kune Kune pigs and Shetland ponies. Those seeking a little more luxury can book one of the two new yurts or four shepherd’s huts (and if even that’s too outdoorsy, there’s a holiday cottage, too). • Pitch (including 2 adults) £20, child £5, open from 4 July, strawfields.co.uk Whitehorse Campsite, near Weymouth, Dorset Named after the gargantuan limestone figure of the Osmington White Horse beneath whose hooves the campsite sits, this pop-up site’s laid-back choose-your-own-pitch ethos means you should be able to escape any madding crowds. In an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) with green rolling vistas, Whitehorse is a mile from the sea as the gull swoops, while Weymouth is just down the road. Walkers are spoiled for choice, with the signposted Hardy Way, South Dorset Ridgeway and South West Coast Path all running close by. • Adult £10, child (5-14) £2.50, open 24-26 July, 31 July–2 August, 7–31 August, whitehorsecampsite.co.uk Bircham Windmill, Great Bircham, Norfolk There’s something soothing about a windmill, especially a grand, graceful one like Bircham. Below its sails an extra field is being prepared for camping this summer so there should be lots of space among the site’s almond, cherry, nectarine, pear and plum trees. In Norfolk’s north-west corner, it’s ideal for exploring both the western end of the Norfolk Coast AONB and the beaches running down The Wash. The windmill – fully restored and working – will be opening to visitors, and you can buy bread and cakes fresh from the adjoining bakery. • Pitches from £20, open 4 July to 30 September, birchamwindmill.co.uk Ostler’s Wood, Stickney, Lincolnshire Hidden away in rural Lincolnshire and run by a family that has farmed in these parts since the 1700s, Ostler’s Wood makes a fine base for hitting the lesser-visited coastline between Boston and Skegness. There are bell tents and deluxe pods, while campers have two equally appealing venues in which to pitch: a generously-sized field fit for spreading out in and enjoying views of the neighbouring countryside, or a brand new woodland area to hide away in and forget the world outside. Both come with fire pits so you can rustle up something tasty after a long day walking the shore. • Woodland pitch £25, field pitch £19 (minimum stay two nights), open 4 July, newfarmholidays.co.uk Ffynnonddewi Camping, near Solva, Pembrokeshire With four hectares of land but only 15 pitches, there’s no excuse for not getting away from it all (and everybody else) at Ffynnonddewi. There are fire pits available to keep you warm while stargazing (the Newgale Beach Dark Sky Discovery Site is nearby) and eco-friendly touches, such as solar power for lighting and phone charging. Down the hill is the ancient village of Solva, ranged snugly around its natural harbour, and a wonderful leg-stretching section of the Wales Coast Path leading westwards to the pocket-size city of St David’s. • Adult £12, child (5–15) £3, hoping to open from 13 July, ffynnonddewicamping.co.uk Fortrose Bay Campsite, Fortrose, Ross-shire Between the Firths of Cromarty and Moray, the Black Isle is a beguiling corner of north-east Scotland (and not an island at all but a peninsula). Below Mount Eagle, with its back to the historic village of Fortrose, the beachside campsite enjoys views over the firth to Inverness. The strand is perfect for watching bottlenose dolphins or for a campfire while the sun sets over the mountains. And while it should be noted that shared facilities will remain closed (so bring a loo), you can probably leave your insect repellent at home – the Black Isle is practically midge-free. • Pitch (including 2 adults) £22; taking bookings for 15 July to 31 October, fortrosebaycampsite.co.uk Kinloch Campsite, Dunvegan, Isle of Skye Beneath the hulking flat-topped peaks known as MacLeod’s Tables, this former croft sits at the head of Loch Dunvegan. The campsite makes for a tranquil spot in which to relax and count the seals or do some bird-watching, maybe even spotting one of the eagles that fly past from time to time. A few steps away is the attractive village of Dunvegan, with its famous (though currently closed) castle and gardens. Beyond, lies the rugged north coast of Skye – a perfect place to lose yourself among rocky cliffs, choppy seas and tiny islands. • Pitch £4, adult £10, 3–15s £6, taking bookings for 15 July, kinloch-campsite.co.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/may/22/greening-economy-prosperity-financial-crisis-coronavirus","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-22T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"We now have the proof: greening the economy doesn't come at the price of prosperity | Fiona Harvey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/greening-economy-prosperity-financial-crisis-coronavirus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/greening-economy-prosperity-financial-crisis-coronavirus","fields":{"headline":"We now have the proof: greening the economy doesn't come at the price of prosperity","bodyText":"Everest is once again visible from Kathmandu, after decades shrouded in pollution. Greenhouse gas emissions have fallen to levels last seen in 2006. Nature has returned to our streets with a quack and a flurry, and people are waking to birdsong in inner cities as the roar of traffic recedes. Clear skies bring little cheer at the food bank, however. Birdsong might lift the heart, but it won’t pay the rent. The environmental renaissance that has come with lockdown shows both the necessity of cleaning up our filthy air and atmosphere, and the dangers of associating economic ruin with environmental gain. Daily greenhouse gas emissions fell by a quarter in many countries when the lockdown bit hardest, according to the first comprehensive study this week, and by early April were 17% down on last year. At the same time, the global economy plunged 6% and half the global workforce now face the loss of their livelihoods, says the International Labour Organisation. Getting people back to work will mean rapidly rising carbon emissions, as it did after the financial crisis of 2008, unless strong action is taken by governments. Already, emissions are climbing: they will be only 4% down on the year if lockdowns are lifted next month. For environmentalists, it may seem tedious to have to explain yet again why it makes economic sense to save the planet – there wouldn’t be an economy without the environment, so if we trash it “growth” will cease to have much meaning. But we teeter on the threshold of what could be the greatest depression for centuries. People who are losing their jobs and homes, with only politicians’ promises to put in their bank account, have every right to ask whether now is the time to prioritise the climate – or couldn’t it wait a year or two while we sort out this catastrophe first? That question has a clear answer: a green recovery can produce higher returns on public spending and create more jobs in both the short term and the long term, compared to the alternative of pouring stimulus cash into the fossil fuel economy. Those findings come from a study of the potential for a green recovery, based on a survey of finance ministries and central bankers, and a comparison with the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, conducted by the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, former World Bank chief economist Lord Stern, and leading economists from Oxford University. After the financial crisis in 2008, calls for a green recovery were partially successful. About 16% of the global stimulus spending was green, including subsidies for renewable energy, seed funding for research and development, and new technology such as electric vehicles. That proportion may seem small, and the effects of the rest of the spending – much of which went on carbon-intensive projects such as concrete construction and coal – were soon apparent: carbon emissions, which had fallen 1.4%, rebounded by a record amount of nearly 6% in 2010. Yet the green stimulus bore fruit. Renewable energy expanded, and the cost of wind and solar power fell far faster than predicted, to the point where both forms of power are now competitive with fossil fuel generation, without the need for subsidy. If that was possible from just 16% of stimulus spending, what could be done if the proportions were reversed? We are much better prepared to create green jobs now, according to the Oxford study. Shovel-ready projects, from insulating homes to widening cycle lanes, abound. Electric vehicle charging points are needed around the world, and the slack in public transport can be used to upgrade rail networks. Car companies, with government incentives, could hasten the move from petrol and diesel engines. The renewable energy industry has progressed in the last decade, making home solar installation cheap and offshore wind farms viable. All of these are labour intensive and would provide quick returns on taxpayer cash. There are fledgling industries that could soar with a government boost. Fatih Birol, the widely respected executive director of the International Energy Agency, points to hydrogen and batteries as two major areas “now ready for the big time”. Hydrogen, in the form of ammonia, will be key to decarbonising shipping, but take-up has been slow due to lack of investment. If governments get it right, the structural changes needed to bring emissions to net zero in the next 30 years will come with a gain in jobs and security. But more needs to be done to ensure that people see the positive, rather than associate falling emissions with falling prosperity. Much of the public discussion so far has focused on attaching “green strings” to bailouts for established industries such as airlines, fossil fuels and car manufacturing. Those are certainly needed – as the failure to attach conditions after the 2008 crisis clearly shows – but can seem like punishing industries already on their knees. Workers on airlines and in shale fields are workers too, with mortgages to pay and families to care for. Shrugging off the loss of their jobs as the casualties of a cleaner future is not good enough: there must be a clear path to high-quality alternatives. After the financial crisis, capital did not reel for long – the initiative was soon recaptured by austerity advocates and increasingly by populists who persuaded voters in many countries that the rollback of the state was the price of fiscal stability. The same forces are still in place: Donald Trump’s White House has already seized the excuse to repeal dozens of regulations on clean air and water, threatening to reverse environmental protections to a pre-Nixon state. If things are to be different this time, people need reassurance on jobs above all, and hymns to nature must be sung to the backing hum of industry.

Since the start of last year, fossil fuel companies have spent billions on high-cost plans to extract oil and gas from tar sands, deepwater fields and the Arctic despite the risks to the climate and shareholder returns. Carbon Tracker, a financial thinktank, found that ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP each spent at least 30% of their investment in 2018 on projects that are inconsistent with climate targets, and would be “deep out of the money in a low-carbon world”. Andrew Grant, the author of the report, said: “Every oil major is betting heavily against a 1.5C world and investing in projects that are contrary to the Paris goals.” The study is the first to analyse individual projects to test whether they are compliant with a 1.5C world, and whether they would be financially sustainable in a low-carbon world. It found that none of the largest listed oil and gas companies are making investment decisions that are in line with global climate goals, and risk wasting $2.2tn (£1.8tn) by 2030 if governments take a tougher stance on carbon emissions. Last year Shell said it would spend $13bn on a liquefied natural gas project in Canada and ExxonMobil agreed to invest $2.6bn in the Aspen project in Canada, the first greenfield oil sands project in five years. “Investors should challenge companies’ spending on new fossil fuel production. The best way to both preserve shareholder value in the transition and align with climate change goals will be to focus on low-cost projects that will deliver the highest returns,” Grant said. The report contradicts the public rhetoric of many oil executives who have claimed to support the Paris goals and vowed to invest in renewable energy projects. A spokesperson for Shell said: “We agree that the world is not moving fast enough to tackle climate change. As the energy system evolves, so is our business, to provide the mix of products that our customers need.” A report from the UN Environment Programme has revealed that global investment in renewable energy projects over the last decade is on track to reach $2.6tn by the end of this year. The investment boom has almost quadrupled the world’s total renewable energy capacity from 414GW at the end of 2009 to an expected total of 1,650GW by the end of this year. Inger Andersen, the executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said: “Investing in renewable energy is investing in a sustainable and profitable future, as the last decade of incredible growth in renewables has shown.” The report, co-authored by BloombergNEF, showed that solar power projects led the rise in renewables. Solar power attracted around half of the total investment in renewables over the last decade and has grown from 25GW at the beginning of 2010 to an expected 638GW by the close of 2019. Jon Moore, the chief executive of BloombergNEF, said the sharp falls in the cost of electricity from wind and solar over recent years has “transformed the choice facing policymakers”. “These technologies were always low carbon and relatively quick to build. Now, in many countries around the world, either wind or solar is the cheapest option for electricity generation,” he said. However, Andersen warned that governments cannot be complacent about the growth of renewable energy if they hope to meet the UN’s climate targets. “Global power sector emissions have risen about 10% over this period. It is clear that we need to rapidly step up the pace of the global switch to renewables if we are to meet international climate and development goals,” she said. Renewable energy made up 12.9% of the world’s total electricity use last year, up from 11.6% the year before."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2019/sep/13/global-renewable-energy-initiative-aims-to-bring-a-billion-people-in-from-the-dark","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-13T11:44:04Z","webTitle":"Global renewable energy initiative aims to bring a billion people in from the dark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/13/global-renewable-energy-initiative-aims-to-bring-a-billion-people-in-from-the-dark","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2019/sep/13/global-renewable-energy-initiative-aims-to-bring-a-billion-people-in-from-the-dark","fields":{"headline":"Global renewable energy initiative aims to bring a billion people in from the dark","bodyText":"Electricity could be delivered to more than a billion people currently living without it within a decade by linking up small-scale projects into a giant, environmentally-friendly network. According to a new global commission, advances in micro energy grids and renewable energy technologies could “dramatically accelerate change” and transform lives in rural areas of sub-Saharan African and south Asia. The Global Commission to End Energy Poverty met for the first time this week to set out plans to accelerate the UN’s sustainable development goal to ensure access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for all people by 2030. The commission, established by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative and the Rockefeller Foundation, plans to bring together leading investors, utilities and policymakers to tackle energy poverty. Under the initiative, the distributed networks would help connect homes, businesses and schools to small-scale solar power projects to deliver cheap, sustainable electricity that can help power local economic growth. The commission includes government leaders, energy industry chief executives and representatives from major development organisations, including Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency. Dr Rajiv Shah, president of the Rockefeller Foundation and formerly of the US agency for international development, said “a whole new way of thinking” about energy distribution was required. “We cannot end poverty without successfully ending energy poverty,” said Shah. “For 140 years we’ve had this mindset that energy access means building big power plants and connecting them to grids, and that’s how you provide electricity. “Today, new technology frontiers, business models, and our knowledge of alternatives is so strong that this commission will be able to set out a new roadmap to end the energy access problem for 1 billion people across the globe.” The commission also plans to help set up new regulation in developing countries to accelerate the rollout of new energy systems, and make the projects more attractive to international investors. “If I want to start a small solar-powered mini-grid programme in a rural part of an under-served country, I could be prevented from actually providing power without permission from the state-owned utility which might own that business opportunity,” Shah explained. “That’s one of many policy roadblocks that is preventing distributed solutions from really being easy to invest in.” Shah will co-chair the commission alongside Dr Ernest Moniz, a former US energy secretary,and Dr Akinwumi Adesina, the president of the African Development Bank. Moniz warned that existing plans to end global energy poverty by 2030 are “not fast enough” and should be more ambitious. “Twenty years ago, energy access might have been defined by having a 20-watt lightbulb. One doesn’t want to denigrate that – the shift from having no light to some light is major – but our ambition is more than that. We want energy access that allows for credible family, community and regional economic development. Frankly, we’d like it to allow for entrepreneurial activity too,” he said. Moniz said that by relying on renewable energy, particularly solar power alongside batteries, developing nations should be able to attract investment in clean energy and rule out the need for future investments in coal-fired power plants. Adopting such methods could also halt the wood-burning that has led to mass deforestation in some countries, he said. “Speaking personally, there is a lot of concern about a new round of investments in coal funded by Chinese development banks. There could be a lock-in of emissions for the future. We would rather see distributed [energy grid] architecture, including renewables, and potentially with a role for gas,” he said. Shah added that economic development and the empowerment of women offered the best chance for a low-emissions future. “If you’re a woman in rural Bihar and you’re able to all of a sudden access electricity, get a sewing machine, create an income, provide light for your daughter to study at night, it’s just transformational,” said Shah. “We’ve seen the same thing in India and Myanmar and throughout Africa. This commission embarks upon this task with a huge amount of optimism and a real understanding of how important it is in the lives of so many people around the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/may/20/heed-lessons-of-2008-crisis-experts-warn-global-leaders","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-20T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"Heed lessons of 2008 crisis, experts warn global leaders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/heed-lessons-of-2008-crisis-experts-warn-global-leaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/may/20/heed-lessons-of-2008-crisis-experts-warn-global-leaders","fields":{"headline":"Heed lessons of 2008 crisis, experts warn global leaders","bodyText":"Global leaders must heed the lessons of the financial crisis of 2008 when they look to repair the damage from the coronavirus pandemic, leading experts have warned, to avoid entrenching disastrous social, health and environmental inequalities and hastening climate breakdown. The 2008 global financial crisis and recession marked the last time the world experienced a convulsion comparable in scale to the coronavirus crisis, though starkly different in its nature. Governments responded first with economic rescue and stimulus packages worth trillions in taxpayer cash, followed in many cases by austerity programmes to cut back public spending. But the past decade has produced far greater levels of inequality than has been seen since before the second world war, producing starker contrasts between the extremely rich and the rest in health, job security, education and other measures, with poorer people suffering worst and the middle classes squeezed while the income of the top 1% soared. Greenhouse gas emissions have also risen, despite warnings from scientists and the Paris agreement of 2015, threatening an even worse crisis if governments do not rapidly change tack. The rise came despite some efforts to “green” the post financial crisis recovery, with low-carbon and environmental measures accounting for about 16% of the stimulus. To avoid a similar outcome this time, leaders must ensure their response to the Covid-19 crisis looks to the good of the whole of society, rather than just the economy, and addresses the climate emergency as well, said Sir Michael Marmot, who led the landmark UK review of public health that found life expectancy fell following austerity. “The scale of what is happening in the economy now is hugely greater than in 2008,” he told the Guardian. “We need to bring the climate agenda and the health agenda together. If we are not careful, the steps we take now will increase inequalities further. Enough people are saying now that austerity is not an experiment we want to repeat.” Marmot is one of the leading voices calling for a “green recovery” that would direct any economic stimulus towards measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as generating jobs and repairing the economy. The economic stimulus in the years after 2008 did produce some environmental improvements such as investments in renewable energy, which have cut the cost of solar and wind power. But the push to cut emissions was stymied by factors such as the sharp fall in the carbon price under the EU’s emissions trading scheme, and China’s construction push. This time can be different, argues Lord Nicholas Stern, one of the world’s leading climate economists and author of the landmark 2006 review of the costs of climate change. “Technology is completely different now. We have seen the costs of key technologies such as renewable energy come right down. We have altogether superior electric vehicle technology. And we know more about air pollution, and how many people it kills.” Putting money into the fossil fuel economy would be a waste, he added. “That produces insecurity. If we do things that leave stranded assets [in fossil fuel businesses], we also have stranded jobs.” Yet talking about environmental measures in the midst of an economic crisis may not be popular, and could be seized on by populist opponents of climate action. The gilets jaunes protests in France were sparked by a rise in fuel taxes that had a particular impact on poorer workers in rural areas. Those protests had roots far deeper than just the fuel tax, some extending back to the response to the 2008 financial crisis, but some experts fear they show how green measures can be presented as contrary to working people’s interests. “The gilets jaunes show there is a lesson to learn,” says Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, and one of the most influential global voices on energy economics. “I am afraid there will be a divergence among policymakers – they will see [a choice between] either jobs or climate change. It’s very important that we put policies in place that help to create jobs and stimulate a clean energy transition.” Leading economists are hopeful, however, that those mistakes can be avoided and that the world will turn to “build back better” instead of pouring resources into fossil fuels. “Focus on what we already know works,” said Birol. That means clean energy, such as wind and solar power, and energy efficiency. “Then focus on technologies that are ready for the big time – hydrogen [energy] and batteries. Third, we need sustained political support.” The green recovery now has a rigorous intellectual underpinning, in the form of a paper by Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, Stern and others, published earlier this month. The paper examined the aftermath of the 2008 crisis and found that putting public money into green projects produced greater returns in both the short and long term than pouring cash into conventional high-carbon projects. That is crucial, according to Brian O’Callaghan, of the Smith School for Enterprise at Oxford University and co-author of the study, because governments want “shovel-ready” projects that produce a lot of jobs quickly, that do not need too high levels of existing skills or extensive training, and that provide infrastructure that benefit the economy. Retrofitting buildings, working on cities to make them more friendly to cyclists and pedestrians, digging trenches for broadband connections, putting in networks for charging electric vehicles, and planting trees are all examples of “shovel-ready” projects that could create jobs in the short term and reduce emissions permanently, according to Stern. “These are things that can be done quickly, and they are labour intensive.” “Policymakers have time to design policy that both accelerates our economic recovery and reduces inequality,” said O’Callaghan. “It is time to rethink economic stimulus. This spending should be about more than just increasing next year’s GDP. Once-in-a-generation government spending could be used to reduce inequality and set up new industries for the coming decade.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/aug/08/india-prime-minister-narendra-modi-plans-to-fell-ancient-forest-to-create-40-new-coal-fields","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-08T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"India plans to fell ancient forest to create 40 new coalfields","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/08/india-prime-minister-narendra-modi-plans-to-fell-ancient-forest-to-create-40-new-coal-fields","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/aug/08/india-prime-minister-narendra-modi-plans-to-fell-ancient-forest-to-create-40-new-coal-fields","fields":{"headline":"India plans to fell ancient forest to create 40 new coalfields","bodyText":"Over the past decade, Umeshwar Singh Amra has witnessed his homeland descend into a battleground. The war being waged in Hasdeo Arand, a rich and biodiverse Indian forest, has pitted indigenous people, ancient trees, elephants and sloth bears against the might of bulldozers, trucks and hydraulic jacks, fighting with a single purpose: the extraction of coal. Yet under a new “self-reliant India” plan by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to boost the economy post-Covid-19 and reduce costly imports, 40 new coalfields in some of India’s most ecologically sensitive forests are to be opened up for commercial mining. Among them are four huge blocks of Hasdeo Arand’s 420,000 acres of forest in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, which sit above an estimated 5bn tonnes of coal. It marks a significant shift. The coal industry in India is state-owned, but this auction of 40 new coal blocks will see the creation of a privatised, commercial coal sector in India. Among those bidding for it are India’s rich and powerful industrial giants, including the $14bn (£11bn) Adani group run by the Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, who operates India’s largest coal power plants and has close ties to Modi. The coal auction has already proved controversial at both the local and political level. At least seven of the coal blocks up for auction were previously deemed “no go” areas for mining due to their environmentally valuable status and about 80% of the blocks are home to indigenous communities and thick forest cover. Four state governments – West Bengal, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh – have written to Modi in opposition or raised legal objections to the auction, and one coal block, which overlapped with the Tadoba tiger reserve in Maharashtra, has already been removed. Amra, who is an Adivasi, a term used to describe India’s indigenous people, was one of nine local sarpanchs – village leaders – who recently wrote to Modi demanding a stop to the auction in Hasdeo Arand. He said: “If the government gave me the option to give up my life in exchange for no more mining happening in the forest, I would do it in a second.” Amra has seen first-hand the environmental devastation wreaked by open-cast coal mines. In 2011, two vast open-cast mines were excavated on the forest’s peripheries, ripping up the fragile land and filling the surroundings with pollution, smoke, heat, noise and poison. Crime rose drastically in the area and the elephants that lived in the forest, disoriented by the new hostile conditions, became aggressive, leading to dozens of deaths. The prospect of more significant blocks of the forest, the largest in India, being handed over to private mining operations was more than Amra could bear. Five villages will be destroyed and more than 6,000 mainly indigenous people displaced, as well as thousands of hectares of trees, torn down for mines and roads. “If more mining happens everything will change; the natural resources will be gone, our way of life will disappear, everything will be under threat,” he said. “We are tribal people, we cannot go out and live in the cities and no amount of money can ever compensate us. There is no forest like this in the world – cut it down and it can never be replaced.” While across the world governments have geared towards a “green recovery” post Covid-19 – the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said recently there was “no good reason for any country to include coal” in recovery plans – India is putting fossil fuel at the forefront of its strategy to turn the pandemic into economic opportunity. “Why cannot India be the world’s largest exporter of coal?” asked Modi as he announced the coal auction project. Yet with its 45% ash content, making it some of the most polluting coal in the world, there is unlikely to be an international market for Indian coal. In addition, many major factories in India cannot run on “dirty” domestic coal, meaning they will still need to import it from abroad. There is also a question of necessity. While India is the world’s second largest consumer of coal, and annually imports 247m tonnes, costing more than $20bn (£15bn), India’s electricity demand is forecast to fall by up to 15% over the next five years due to the economic reverberations of Covid-19. Meanwhile, a report this week by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air concluded that the current state-run coal mines of India already have capacity to produce 20% more coal than the expected demand in 2030. Environmental activists also question why India cannot be weaned off foreign coal through a gradual increase in investment in domestic renewable energy, such as solar. This month, Modi inaugurated Asia’s largest solar farm in the state of Madhya Pradesh. India is the world’s cheapest producer of solar power and the cost of constructing a new solar plant is 14% less than that of a building a new coal plant. With proper investment, it has been estimated that the solar energy industry could generate as many as 1.6m jobs in India by 2022, far more than would be generated by domestic coal. But India’s joint secretary for coal, Maddirala Nagaraju, said that all the country’s projections showed that demand for coal would increase and insisted that increased domestic coalmining was the “cheapest way of meeting the energy needs of the people”. “We are the country with the fourth largest coal reserves in the world and we need to provide energy security for over a billion people: coal is the only way,” said Nagaraju. He conceded that there would be “costly trade-offs” in opening up protected forest areas for mining, but said this had the support of local communities who “want the land to be acquired because they get high compensation packages”. He added: “Yes, some people have objected, but the mining will bring a lot of development, employment and money to these areas. How else will we develop these Adivasi people in central India?” Among the prominent opponents to the project is the former environment minister, Jairan Ramesh, who also wrote a letter to Modi condemning coal auctions. It was during his time in office that a survey was carried out in 2010 on India’s biggest coalfields and determined that 30% were “no-go areas” due to their biodiversity or resident tiger or elephant populations. Yet since Modi came to power in 2014, that 30% has been reduced to about 5%. Ramesh alleged this was a direct result of pressure from the powerful corporate coal lobby, Adani in particular. The Adani group is contracted to operate two of the mines currently open in Hasdeo Arand, and has been pushing to expand mining operations in the forest for years, even reportedly offering microloans to local tribal people in order to win their support. “Adani is behind this,” claims Ramesh. “He is one of the most influential forces on the government.” “Modi poses as a great environmental champion globally but his track record is one of complete loosening of environmental laws and regulations,” Ramesh added. “The corporate lobbies are just too powerful and in the name of ease for businesses, environment has become the biggest casualty.” The Adani group rejected the allegations as baseless and politically motivated. A spokesperson said the company: “Has always strived to provide balanced and affordable energy supply to an energy-deprived population of 1.3 billion people whose per capita energy consumption is less than half the world’s average and almost one-tenth of many of the developed economies. “The Adani Group has been a leading contributor to India’s vision for a balanced energy mix and an enabler of India’s leadership in meeting its [Paris agreement on climate change] target.” It said it aimed to become the world’s largest renewable energy company by 2025. • This article was amended on 18 August 2020.

The investment in the London-based Lightsource marks a turnaround for the British oil firm, which rebranded as Beyond Petroleum in 2000 but shut its alternative energy headquarters nine years later. “We’re excited to be coming back to solar, but in a new and very different way,” said BP’s chief executive, Bob Dudley. Dev Sanyal, the firm’s chief executive for alternative energy, said BP was returning to solar because the sector had matured and the model had shifted from manufacturing panels to developing solar farms. “[Solar] is really an important part of the overall energy mix. It will constitute around 10% of global power in the next 20 years and is growing around 15% per annum. We like the fundamentals of the industry and we like the fundamentals of the company,” he said. The solar firm will be renamed Lightsource BP and BP will take two seats on the company’s board. Nick Boyle, founder and chief executive of Lightsource, said in many countries solar had moved from relying on government support to being able to compete on its own. “In the last couple of years, we’ve hit that interesting inflection point where unsubsidised solar has become a direct competitor and something that actually beat other forms of electricity generation,” he said. “Whereas before the market was very different and needed support, now we are in a completely new world.” The company will focus on building solar projects in the US, India, Europe and the Middle East. While the $200m stake is a small fraction of BP’s $15bn-17bn total spend this year, Sanyal said it was a substantial investment. The company employs 8,000 people in its alternative energy business, which is mostly centred on wind power in the US and biofuels in Brazil. Asked if the investment marked a return to the Beyond Petroleum strategy pushed under the former chair John Browne, Sanyal said: “We want to play our full role in the low carbon transition.” BP is not alone in diversifying away from oil and gas. The Anglo-Dutch firm Shell has been buying electric car infrastructure companies, France’s Total has been acquiring battery storage firms and Norway’s Statoil is pioneering floating windfarms. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/nov/14/green-giants-the-massive-projects-that-could-make-australia-a-clean-energy-superpower","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-13T19:00:44Z","webTitle":"Green giants: the massive projects that could make Australia a clean energy superpower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/14/green-giants-the-massive-projects-that-could-make-australia-a-clean-energy-superpower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/nov/14/green-giants-the-massive-projects-that-could-make-australia-a-clean-energy-superpower","fields":{"headline":"Green giants: the massive projects that could make Australia a clean energy superpower","bodyText":"The world’s largest power station is planned for a vast piece of desert about half the size of greater suburban Sydney in Australia’s remote north-west. Called the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, its size is difficult to conceptualise. If built in full, there will be 1,600 giant wind turbines and a 78 sq km array of solar panels a couple of hundred kilometres east of Port Hedland in the Pilbara. This solar-wind hybrid power plant would have a capacity of 26 gigawatts, more than Australia’s entire coal power fleet. The hub’s backers say the daytime sun and nightly winds blowing in from the Indian Ocean are perfectly calibrated to provide a near constant source of emissions-free energy around the clock. Most of it will be used to run 14GW of electrolysers that will convert desalinated seawater into “green hydrogen” – a form of energy that analysts expect to be in increasing demand as a replacement for fossil fuels in the years and decades ahead. Though still five years away from construction, the hub vaulted closer to reality in recent weeks after the federal government granted it major project status – a designation that should smooth the approval processes – and the Western Australian government greenlit its first stage. It is an ambitious undertaking, but it is not alone. The Asian Renewable Energy Hub heads a list of projects and potential developments, many private and some government backed, that are seeking to capitalise on what the economist Ross Garnaut described as Australia’s potential to be a clean energy superpower. While Australia’s climate politics remain stuck in gridlock, the government is focused on promoting gas-fired developments and – Covid-19 aside – national greenhouse gas emissions have largely flatlined in the years since the Coalition abolished an overarching federal climate policy. However, the plummeting cost of solar and wind energy is encouraging investments that seemed unlikely not long ago. The pace of investment in large-scale clean energy has slowed since the 23% national renewable energy target was filled and not replaced last year, but state governments and corporates are filling some of that gap. This week alone there were a string of extraordinary announcements. The New South Wales government plans to underwrite 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of storage over the next decade, Woolworths is promising to run its supermarkets and operations on 100% green energy within five years, and the country’s biggest super fund, AustralianSuper, dumped its shares in Whitehaven Coal as it set a path to a net-zero emissions investment portfolio by 2050. Perhaps most remarkably, Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest foreshadowed that his Fortescue Metals Group would move aggressively into renewable energy, setting a goal of building 235GW across the globe. Here are some of the other green shoots and big ideas that are on the horizon or, in some cases, already with us. Green hydrogen exports: the Asian Renewable Energy Hub The Pilbara project was initially planned as a means to sell green energy to coal-rich Indonesia via sub-sea cable. That idea has been dropped in favour of hydrogen, based on the expectation that by 2035 the world will be looking for vast amounts of green fuel to replace coal, gas and oil. Alex Hewitt, the founder and director of CWP Renewables, an Australian-based partner in the hub, says the $53bn development is the country’s first “renewable energy project at oil and gas scale” – and a sign of where the world is headed. “The buzzwords here are scale and urgency,” he says. “When fully operational this will produce 1.8m tonnes of hydrogen every year for decades, with an energy content equivalent to 40% of Australia’s overall electricity generation.” All being well, Hewitt says, its first shipment of green energy into Asia will be made in 2027. Hydrogen has grabbed the attention of politicians and industry, including winning support at federal and state level in Australia. There are more than 20 smaller hydrogen projects under way across the country, but the hub dwarfs them. Hewitt says it will allow the fuel to be produced for less than $2 a kilogram, the level at which the Morrison government expects it to be cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. “It’s amazing how fast the transition is coming,” he says. “All the technology we’re using is proven at demonstration level. We have the right backing, we have the partners and it will get done.” The consortium expects 3GW of its solar and wind capacity to be used locally to power mining sites and large trucks, replacing 3bn litres of imported diesel used in the Pilbara each year. Some of the energy may help create new industries such as green steel, which is seen as a significant economic opportunity once coal-fired processes can be affordably replaced with renewables and hydrogen. But most of the energy created will be exported. Because hydrogen condenses from a gas into a liquid only at very low temperatures (about -250C), it will be shipped as green ammonia, which is safer to transport and created by blending hydrogen with nitrogen. While not everyone is as bullish, the consortium believes the applications for green hydrogen and ammonia may be as broad as fossil fuels are today, including heavy road transport, long-range shipping and aviation, fertiliser production, energy-intensive big industry such as mining operations, and electricity generation. On the latter, they are closely watching a Japanese trial using ammonia to co-fire an existing coal power plant. Solar exports: Sun Cable The second of Australia’s two giant renewable export projects is no less extraordinary in its ambition, and also has been granted major project status from the federal government. Like the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, it is billed as the largest of its type in the world. The $22bn Sun Cable proposal, backed by billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Forrest, involves building a 10GW solar farm with battery storage at the Newcastle Waters cattle station about 750km south of Darwin. Some of the electricity may be used to help power the Northern Territory capital and Indigenous settlements, but most would be intended for transmission via sub-sea cables that would snake 3,800kms through the Indonesian archipelago to Singapore. Sun Cable’s chief executive, David Griffin, has said the project could provide up to a fifth of the city-state’s electricity. Long-distance high-voltage direct current submarine cables are used in Europe, but this would be the world’s longest by some distance. The NT government last month announced the project had reached the first stage of the environmental approvals process, and Sun Cable has begun discussions with authorities in both Singapore and Indonesia and surveyed the first 750km of the route. Its goal is to start construction in late 2023 and, like the Pilbara hub, to be exporting by 2027. Offshore wind energy: the Star of the South While onshore wind and solar have boomed in recent years as developers rushed to fill the national renewable energy target, Australia is yet to follow other countries – particularly in northern Europe and Britain – in building turbines off the coast. That may change with a proposal to construct a 2.2GW windfarm in Bass Strait off Port Albert and Mcloughlins Beach in South Gippsland. According to the proponents, the $10bn project would be one of the world’s largest offshore windfarms, and likely to meet about 20% of Victoria’s electricity needs. It would involve a yet-to-be-determined number of turbines – the company just says hundreds – of between 185 and 245 metres being built on the seabed between 7km and 25km offshore. It is potentially a sensitive place to build, with plans needing to factor in the impact on marine life and of grid connections to the Latrobe Valley inland. One of the questions hanging over the project will be its cost, but Star of the South maintains it makes economic sense – that the technology is becoming cheaper and the generation patterns of offshore wind will complement, rather than compete with, onshore renewables. It is seeking environmental approval from the Victorian government and waiting on the commonwealth to complete a legal framework for offshore clean energy developments, but has a goal of starting to generate by 2025. Energy security: large-scale batteries Where offshore wind is in its infancy, batteries are being built at a pace few expected. Just four years ago, the Australian Energy Market Operator forecast that the country might have only 4MW of large-scale batteries by 2020, and build no more before 2036. The reality is a marked contrast. There is already 287MW in operation or committed to construction, including several batteries built alongside wind or solar developments. Last week, the Victorian government announced a contract for a 300MW battery near Geelong – larger than everything built to date and billed as one of the biggest in the world. While batteries are often assumed to be storing surplus energy from the middle of the day for use when the sun goes down, the primary use so far in Australia is to bolster the security of the grid. When something goes wrong — such as a major transmission line being taken out by a tornado or a power station “tripping”, as happens more than 100 times a year — batteries are called on to plug the gap in a fraction of a second to prevent the grid collapsing. Simon Holmes à Court, a senior adviser to the Climate and Energy College at Melbourne University, said they were an attractive option for state governments wanting to strengthen their grids at modest cost. Independent reviews found Australia’s first big battery, built at Hornsdale in South Australia in 2017, saved consumers $150m in its first two years in operation. Expect to see more of them, rapidly. “Falling costs and greater familiarity of the technology have led to solar and wind developers increasingly building batteries into their plans,” Holmes à Court says. Australia’s biggest power plant: rooftop solar Perhaps the Asian Renewable Energy Hub will one day pass it, but for now the biggest power plant in the country is spread across 29% of Australian homes. By the middle of this year, the country had about 12GW of solar rooftop panels, with installations continuing at a pace unaffected by Covid-19 or the gradual winding back of government incentives. Investment in large-scale renewable energy fell this year, but the growth in small-scale solar has increased to fill the gap. It is expected 2.9GW will go up this year, equivalent in capacity to a couple of average-sized coal plants. It has prompted authorities to take steps so panels can be temporarily disconnected from the grid if the influx of solar power causes problems for grid security. The 20th-century electricity system, based on a handful of large generators, was not built to cope with an influx of distributed power. A better solution may be to make it more financially attractive to install household batteries, which if pooled together can operate as a centrally controlled virtual power plant, charging or dispatching energy to the grid as needed. South Australia is trialling this sort of system, but for now incentives are limited in most states. In the meantime, analysts expect the skyrocketing installation rate to continue, reflecting the International Energy Agency’s observation that solar can now offer the cheapest electricity in history."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/dec/28/seabird-patrols-to-self-healing-buildings-the-15-conservation-stories-to-watch-in-2021","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-28T07:00:07Z","webTitle":"Seabird patrols to self-healing buildings: the 15 conservation stories to watch in 2021","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/28/seabird-patrols-to-self-healing-buildings-the-15-conservation-stories-to-watch-in-2021","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/dec/28/seabird-patrols-to-self-healing-buildings-the-15-conservation-stories-to-watch-in-2021","fields":{"headline":"Seabird patrols to self-healing buildings: the 15 conservation stories to watch in 2021","bodyText":"If it did nothing else, the emergence of Covid-19 a year ago underlined for all of us the importance of anticipating and preparing for – and, as appropriate, steering the course of – things that might happen in the future. That is, in a nutshell, the goal of the 2021 horizon scan of emerging global biological conservation issues recently published in the journal Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution by the Cambridge University conservation biologist William Sutherland and a team of 24 other conservation practitioners and researchers from around the world. The team started by identifying 97 trends with potentially large impacts on conservation and biodiversity, then trimmed the list down to the top 15 that they agreed “society may urgently need to address”. “Recent global assessments of biological diversity and climate change indicate negative trends and a rapidly narrowing window for action to reverse these trends,” the researchers wrote. “We believe that identification of novel or emerging issues for global biological conservation should inform policymaking.” The 2021 horizon scan is the latest in a series that stretches back more than a decade. In addition to making their predictions for the year ahead, the team members reviewed selections from the first horizon scan, published in 2009. They found that one-third of the issues identified in that scan “have since developed into major issues or caused considerable environmental impacts”. Here are the issues that bubbled to the top in this year’s scan: Suffocating reefs Coral reefs have come under siege from many threats in recent decades, from invasive species to warming waters to harmful fishing practices. Increasingly worrisome is hypoxia-associated coral mortality – suffocation from a lack of oxygen due to an influx of nutrients from land or aquaculture facilities into ocean waters. Because warm water holds less oxygen than cold water, scientists fear that climate change will only make this problem worse. Deoxygenation of ocean waters has already harmed corals in relatively small spaces such as bays and lagoons. Although we know relatively little about how resilient corals might be to low oxygen, there is concern that in some cases it could be the last straw for these valuable and beleaguered ecosystems. Iron-fortified coasts Ocean coastlines are abundant sources of plant and animal life – and those in polar zones are becoming increasingly so due to climate change-induced melting of glacial and floating ice that contains relatively large amounts of iron. Plants need iron to photosynthesise, so melting ice stimulates plant growth. This increases coastal ecosystems’ ability to soak up planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and potentially harmful nutrients running off land, and boosts the food supply for other living things in the area. But as the trend continues, it is also likely to alter biodiversity and ecosystem structure and complexity along polar coastlines in unknown ways, even as it enhances biological communities’ ability to mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration. Waves of change Heads up, ocean ecosystems: global energy trends are about to bring big waves of change. Numerous offshore oil and gas rigs as well as first-generation offshore wind turbines are slated for decommissioning in the near future. A variety of strategies could be deployed for doing so, from removing all or part of an installation, to converting it to an artificial reef, to simply abandoning it. At the same time, new ocean-based wind energy installations and natural gas wells will be coming online. These changes in ocean-sited infrastructure could have a big impact on habitat in the vicinity – for better, for worse or for both, depending on the location, the extent to which existing infrastructure has been colonised by marine life, and specific implementation strategies. Seabird patrol Ocean-going vessels carrying out illegal fishing activities have ways of covering their tracks, from deactivating electronic tracking systems to avoiding the use of lights at night. The difficulty of finding such covertly operating boats on the vast open seas can be a limiting factor in efforts to prevent illegal activities that lead to overfishing and biodiversity degradation. In an interesting twist on surveillance, scientists are looking at enlisting albatrosses and other ocean-going birds to help track down troublemakers. The birds, which follow fishing vessels in hopes of grabbing morsels, can be fitted with transmitters that can help enforcement officials to find them. Work is already under way to evaluate the approach – including consideration of the extent to which it might put the birds themselves at risk of harm. Location spoofing Although seabirds may be attracted to fishing boats, they’re not quite as helpful when it comes to tracking vessels that aren’t flinging fish bits off the back. It is possible to identify and pinpoint the location of most such ships using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and automatic identification systems (AIS). However, technologies are emerging that allow those wishing to avoid detection due to surreptitious activities to muddle their identification and coordinates. Conservation biologists speculate that such technologies could make it easier to illegally transport animals or animal parts, engage in illegal mining or conduct other covert activities. Efforts are under way to develop technologies to thwart such deceptive practices, but it could be a decade before they are ready to deploy. Long-tail hormones It’s bad enough for pollutants to harm animals that come in contact with them. But now there is evidence that some water-polluting chemicals that alter endocrine systems in fish can get passed to future generations as well. By mimicking or blocking the proper function of hormones, such compounds, which include many used in households and on farms, can cause deformities and fertility issues. And now it appears that in some species, parents can pass those disruptions to the next generation. Concerns are growing that this long-tail impact will be found in other animals as well. Low-hanging clouds Among the little-known prospective victims of climate change are the low clouds that hang over coastal oceans near the equator, helping to cool the atmosphere. The nature and extent of these clouds depend on a variety of conditions that are expected to change as our climate warms, including ocean temperatures, air movement in the atmosphere and the layout of coastal lands. Changes in the cloud cover, in turn, could affect the clouds’ ability to counteract global heating and preserve the conditions in which human settlements and ecosystems have evolved to thrive, and could exacerbate fire risk in the region. Trillion-tree trouble? Numerous groups have begun promoting extensive planting of carbon dioxide-absorbing trees as a way to help counter the climate-disrupting rise in the concentration of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere. But massive tree-planting efforts are not without concerns. Even as proponents tout the approach to climate change mitigation, others warn of potential problems. For one thing, poorly sited plantations could end up replacing ecosystems that sequestered more carbon than the trees do. For another, biodiversity could take a hit in the process as species-rich native habitats are replaced by monoculture plantations with the primary goal of sucking away CO2. Careful planning will be needed to ensure such initiatives don’t do more harm than good in the long run. Fire prevention logging As climate and other conditions change, the intensity and severity of wildfires are increasing in North America, Australia, central Africa and elsewhere around the world. One strategy that has been proposed to cut the risk is to reduce the number of trees available to burn. Some research suggests that such a strategy could do little to decrease the likelihood of harm to humans and property, and in some instances could even increase it. Nevertheless, with strong public pressure to do something about this growing problem, there is a real likelihood that policymakers will turn to tree thinning as a way to prevent wildfires – with certain but unknown impacts on the ecosystem and multiple species that call forests home. Super sustainable farming A quiet revolution is under way in India: the large-scale adoption of sustainable intensification as a farming practice. Across the world’s second most populous country, state-level policies are incentivising farmers to adopt a suite of practices that reduce the adverse environmental impacts of agriculture while boosting crop yields, income, health and wellbeing. To date, more than a quarter of a million farmers have adopted the new approach, which includes eliminating synthetic inputs, enhancing crop diversity, rotating crops and more. Millions more are expected to follow the practice, which is also known as natural, community-based or zero-budget farming. As success stories roll in, the initiatives could set off a snowball effect, leading other countries and farmers to follow suit. Navigation miscues? If you have ever mistaken a satellite for a star in the night sky, you’ve had a taste of the confusion scientists fear might face some birds, mammals and insects in the future. About 2,600 artificial satellites circle our planet, and booming communications technologies are expected to catalyse the deployment of thousands more. What do these plentiful extra points of light mean for animals that use the stars for navigational cues? No one knows for sure – but it’s a question worth investigating before permanent damage is done to populations already beleaguered by human impacts on the surface of the Earth. Stranded energy meets bitcoin At certain times and in certain places around the world, the ability to generate electricity exceeds demand, as limited by economics or logistics. The excess capacity – whether methane byproducts from oil drilling or wind or solar power that exceeds local demand – may just go to waste due to market logistics. But what if a pop-up demand were available to use this “stranded energy” on an as-needed basis, at a discounted (but better than throwing it away) price? Recently, bitcoin mining – an energy-intensive process required to keep transactions fair – has been emerging as a possible contender. Bitcoin mining is relatively flexible when it comes to time and place, so it could create a use for these resources that gives a low payout but is better than nothing. There is some concern by those working to mitigate biodiversity-compromising climate change that using bitcoin to close the use-capacity gap could boost use of fossil fuels – but there is also optimism that it may help to make renewable energy sources more economically desirable. We’re all detectives now If officials don’t notice or respond to environmental problems, are they still problems? Environmental quality in many regions around the world is limited by insufficient monitoring, detection, prevention and mitigation of pollution or other assaults. But that could change, thanks to emerging technologies. Because of the growing adoption of smartphones and internet connectivity, private citizens around the world are being empowered to act as environmental detectives, identifying and calling out problems they identify through social media mining. This approach has already been used to document locust swarms in east Africa. As more and more people connect, it could be applied around the world to detect and encourage responses to environmental assaults of all sorts, from water pollution to wildlife poaching. Self-healing buildings The development of self-healing building materials bodes well for biodiversity in a variety of ways. Such materials, which are based on a variety of inputs, including chemicals and bacteria, aim to enhance the ability of built structures to bounce back from damage without the need to repair or replace them. They could be beneficial in a number of ways. For one, they can cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the need to produce concrete and carry out construction projects to repair or replace damaged structures. For another, they can reduce the need to mine or quarry new materials, processes that often involve destroying habitat for plants, animals and other living things. In addition, they can shrink the production of construction debris and the accompanying increased demand for landfill space. Baltic-Black connection A 1,200-mile (2,000km) river-and-canal system will have environmental impacts under any circumstances. But conservation biologists are particularly concerned about the one being considered for connecting the Baltic and Black seas in Europe. Known as the E40 Waterway, it would cross the Polesia wilderness area, one of the largest in Europe, and probably affect more than 70 wildlife reserves and conservation areas. It also would pass near, and potentially disrupt, the Chernobyl exclusion zone and radioactive materials in the area. The project, which is already in motion, is expected to have numerous economic, social and environmental benefits. However, it also carries risk to biodiversity in terms of disrupted ecology and hydrology, and enhanced dispersion of non-native invasive species.

A massive solar energy boom is being predicted for 2018, after an unprecedented number of industrial solar farms were approved by the New South Wales and Queensland governments last year. Last month also became the biggest January on record for rooftop installations, according to the renewables website RenewEconomy and industry analysts SunWiz. With 111MW of new panels, it saw a 69% rise compared with the same month last year and became one of the top five months ever – largely driven by low installation costs and a boost in commercial uptake. At the same time, nearly 30 new industrial solar farms are scheduled to come on line. NSW approved 10 solar farm projects last year – twice as many as the year before – and has approved another in 2018. Queensland currently has 18 large-scale projects under construction, which is the most in the country. The new farms could be operational within the year, according to John Grimes, the chief executive of the Smart Energy Council. “These solar farms can be built within a matter of weeks,” he said. “They’re really quick and simple.” Together, the new large-scale projects could add between 2.5GW and 3.5GW to the national grid and rooftop installations could add another 1.3GW, according to the Smart Energy Council’s estimates. This would nearly double the nation’s solar energy capacity, currently 7GW, in a single year. “The train tracks are about to converge,” Grimes said. “Rooftop installations and utilities are both booming and could turbo-boost the solar numbers overall.” In Queensland, residential solar panels are already the state’s largest source of energy, producing more combined than the 1.7GW Gladstone power station. Just under a third (30%) of residential homes in the state have solar installed – the most in the country. With the completion of the new solar farms, solar will provide 17% of the state’s energy. “We’ve turned the sunshine state into the solar state,” Queensland’s former energy minister Mark Bailey said in October. In New South Wales, the planning minister, Anthony Roberts, said the 10 new solar farms would generate 1.2GW of energy and reduce carbon emissions by more than 2.5m tonnes – the equivalent of taking about 800,000 cars off the road. In January this year, NSW announced another plant – the 170MW Finley plant in the Riverina – as did Queensland, the 120MW solar farm at Munna Creek. Grimes said the solar boom “was only going to grow” in future. “Solar is the cheapest way to generate electricity in the world – full stop,” he said. “It’s not unusual for grid pricing to be north of 20c per kilowatt hour in a majority of jurisdicitions. A solar array, at an average size for an average home, if you amortise the cost over 20 years, the effective rate is 5c per kilowatt hour. That’s called an economic no-brainer.” He said the rush to install rooftop panels could have been sparked by January’s warm weather and rising energy prices. “I think people are acutely aware of energy prices. People are running air conditioning and thinking, ‘hooley dooley I’m going to get a bill’.” 2017 saw a record 1.25GW of solar power added to the grid nationally, counting both large-scale solar farms and rooftop panels. The predicted rate of rooftop panels alone in 2018 is expected to be 1.3GW."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-good-news-pandemic-joy-upbeat-optimistic-covid-19","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-24T09:00:04Z","webTitle":"The good news files: joy and silver linings in the coronavirus pandemic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-good-news-pandemic-joy-upbeat-optimistic-covid-19","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-good-news-pandemic-joy-upbeat-optimistic-covid-19","fields":{"headline":"The good news files: joy and silver linings in the coronavirus pandemic","bodyText":"What would this newsletter look like if we didn’t write it down, but talked it out on the internet in a way that you could hear, watch, and question?

Everyone it seems is reaching for the sewing machine or the 3D printer. Like these two Irish schoolboys, featured in the Irish Times. Clear skies and gorgeous spring weather have powered Germany to record solar power generation, according to Time magazine Meanwhile, we quite like the new bite-size “tarts app” (there’s always reason to smile). Though it’s early days, it will be interesting to see if this kind of service takes off and sustains its appeal. And finally, this factual explainer on how quickly we might get to a vaccine was published by the Wellcome Trust. What we heard Barbara Feeney, recently repatriated to Dublin from Melbourne, wrote in praise of the simple hug: In Iceland, the country’s forestry service has recommended that people hug a tree once a day during lockdown, to aid relaxation and boost their sense of wellbeing. Rangers are recommending a daily five-minute tree hug. A rather peculiar instruction, but there’s something quite lovely about it too. This got me thinking about hugging. Before now I had never thought a lot about hugging. I suppose it’s just one of those things we do on automatic pilot. There’s a lot to be said for technology and how it can connect us and help us feel less alone, but nothing makes up for a good hug. So, while I wait for a government-approved hug, I’ll keep hugging my teddy and maybe give the Icelandic tree-hugging a go! Dede Callichy meanwhile got in touch from Byron Bay, Australia: My greatest reasons for gratitude are crystal-clear air, much quieter streets, more respect and kindness between people, and the dedication of those making big donations and those in service – medical staff, supermarkets, meal takeaway outlets, garbage collectors, teachers ... and the list goes on. Thank you all. Brooke Fandrich from Wisconsin is relishing the chance to take stock: Over this lengthy period of social distancing, I’ve felt like the ‘mute button’ has been pressed on my life. The typical noise of my days has been silenced, and that’s made a huge impact since we’ve finally been given some time to be alone with our own thoughts. It seems like people are using their isolation as an opportunity for self-reflection and healing. During social distancing, I’ve realized that myself and many others were experiencing chronic stress in our old daily life. We were finally able to work up the courage and get professional psychiatric help. Many members of my family are coming out about their own mental health, and it seemed like every website I went to for professional help gave a notice that they were receiving a significant number of new patients during the pandemic. I know that social isolation is extremely harmful to overall wellbeing, and many people are suffering from social distancing, but a lot of us have actually been encouraged by it to start speaking up for ourselves. It may be interesting for you to research if the world of professional psychological care has really been experiencing an overall wave of new patients during the pandemic. All these changes have exposed serious faults in the way our society was being run, and I think that goes down to the most basic individual level. It would be amazing if this crisis has encouraged people to reach out for the help that they’ve needed for so long. Thanks for the positives. And thank you, Brooke. Where was the Upside?

Ingka Group, the holding company that runs the majority of Ikea stores, said operating profit fell to €2bn (£1.7bn) in the year to the end of August despite a 5.3% rise in revenue to €39.1bn. Pretax profits for the business, which also includes an investment arm and TaskRabbit, the odd-job gig economy app, rose 19% to €2.5bn as a result of a surge in income from financial investments. The company, which employs 166,000 staff at 374 Ikea stores in 30 countries, said it was “a challenging time for retail” but that sales continued to rise at its existing stores, smaller city stores and online. Sales at established stores rose 0.7% while online sales were up nearly 50%, to account for more than 10% of total retail sales. The company has previously reported that UK sales rose 8% to £2.1bn in the year largely thanks to a surge in online business. Juvencio Maeztu, Ingka Group’s deputy chief executive, said Ikea would aim to accelerate sales growth by opening more city-centre stores and aim to cut costs by investment in new technology and ways of working with sustainability in mind. Last year, the group said it was cutting 7,500 office jobs worldwide, including 350 in the UK, to focus on improving its online operation and city-centre format. But Ingka, which is one of 12 franchise groups that operate under deals with the brand’s owner, Inter IKEA Systems, has also invested in wind and solar power, which it says will keep costs down longer term. Since 2009 Ikea has pumped close to €2.5bn into renewable energy so that it now owns 534 wind turbines and 715,000 solar panels in 14 countries as well as a further 920,000 solar panels on store rooftops. The company said it was on track to produce as much energy from renewable sources as consumed in its operations by next year. Maeztu said: “We want to be a part of creating solutions for the challenges our planet is facing, and we are taking bold steps securing our ambition to become climate positive by 2030. It is even clearer that financial performance and sustainability go hand in hand, and for us this is how we will grow, stay relevant and remain profitable, long term.” He said the financial performance for this financial year is in line with plans. “We will continue to test and try new things. At times we will fail and that’s OK, as that’s part of how we constantly develop and improve our business to better meet the needs of our customers for many years to come,” Maeztu said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/nov/11/cornish-homes-take-part-in-trial-to-supply-clean-power-to-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-11T06:01:04Z","webTitle":"Cornish homes take part in trial to supply clean power to grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/11/cornish-homes-take-part-in-trial-to-supply-clean-power-to-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/nov/11/cornish-homes-take-part-in-trial-to-supply-clean-power-to-grid","fields":{"headline":"Cornish homes take part in trial to supply clean power to grid","bodyText":"Hundreds of homes and businesses in Cornwall have started selling electricity to their local energy network and the national energy system in a pioneering move. The trial is the first time that traditional energy users – such as homes, hotels and businesses – have acted as suppliers in a microcosm of a full energy system. The trial harnessed together 100 Cornish homes, fitted with batteries and solar panels, to act as a mini virtual power plant for the local energy network, Western Power Distribution, and the UK’s energy system operator, National Grid. During sunny spells when homes generate more than enough electricity from solar panels they can store the power to use later, or supply the energy system with clean extra power. The homes took part in the trial alongside 150 local businesses, which were prepared to adjust how much energy they used depending on the balance of energy supply and demand on the grid. If wind and solar power output dropped the companies could choose to use less electricity in exchange for a payment from National Grid, or if the local grid had more electricity than it needed the companies could ramp up their energy demand. National Grid already offers to pay firms that own utility-scale batteries to provide a similar service, but the trial is the first time that companies can take part in the same “local energy market” as the network operator. The market was designed by energy giant Centrica and modelled on the same system used to balance energy markets across Europe. The energy companies believe the trial could help create a nationwide chain of flexible smart grids built around clean energy. Pieter-Jan Mermans, a director at Centrica Business Solutions, described the trial as “a milestone moment for the energy network” after years of research. “Improving grid flexibility benefits everyone from generators to consumers, and these trials represent a major step forward. We are hugely grateful to the householders and businesses across Cornwall who have embraced this trial with open arms,” he said. One local business, The Cornish Ice Company, is using its industrial freezers to act as a battery for the grid. The company can easily cut electricity to its freezers for short periods without affecting temperatures, meaning it can offer spare electricity to either the local grid or the national system operator. “Exploring the provision of flexibility through a local energy market is a first for us.” Colm Murphy, a senior manager at National Grid, said. “The potential is really exciting as we look to unlock more flexible energy resources in the market, and greater cost benefits to consumers,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/mar/07/markets-slide-surging-oil-price-stagflation-ftse-russia-sanctions-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-07T18:33:34Z","webTitle":"German chancellor Scholz pushes back against Russian energy import ban, as oil and gas climb – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/mar/07/markets-slide-surging-oil-price-stagflation-ftse-russia-sanctions-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/mar/07/markets-slide-surging-oil-price-stagflation-ftse-russia-sanctions-business-live","fields":{"headline":"German chancellor Scholz pushes back against Russian energy import ban, as oil and gas climb – as it happened","bodyText":"With European stock markets closed, here’s a recap of the main events today. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has pushed back against calls to ban Russian oil and gas imports as part of western sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Scholz cautioned that such a move could put Europe’s energy security at risk, and that energy imports from Russia were currently essential to citizens’ daily lives. Scholz statement came after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Sunday that the US was talking to its European allies about banning Russian oil imports. Blinken’s comments triggered a dramatic surge in oil prices overnight, with Brent crude up 18% at one stage to hit $139 per barrel, the highest in 14 years. It has since dipped back but is still around $125 per barrel, up from below $80 at the start of this year. The price of wholesale gas also leapt alarmingly today, with the UK contract for delivery next month hittinga record of 800p per therm, compared to typical prices below 50p/therm a year ago. Gas prices closed about 10% higher tonight around 500p, a level that would intensify the cost-of-living crisis gripping households and businesses. European stock markets racked up fresh losses, as the Ukraine war continued to hammer share prices. Germany’s DAX shed another 2%, ending in a bear market – over 20% below its record high in January. In London, the FTSE 100 fell another 0.4%, with oil producers and miners rallying, but banks, travel companies, retailers and consumer goods makers all under renewed pressure. Companies continued to cut ties with Russia. All four of the UK’s big accountancy firms have now cut off businesses in Russia and Belarus, with EY and Deloitte joining KPMG and PwC in legally separating their operations. The Conservative peer Greg Barker has resigned as chairman of EN+, the mining company part-owned by the sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Three more Russian billionaires have resigned from the board of the $22bn (£17bn) investment firm LetterOne after the EU imposed sanctions on its two biggest shareholders. Here are more of today’s stories: We’ll be back tomorrow. Goodnight, GW. The European Union is in the grip of a “growing gas crisis” aggravated by its dependency on Russia, Brussels will warn, as it makes a further push for energy savings and a switch to renewable power. According to a draft paper on EU energy prices, which is due to be published on Tuesday, and which has been seen by the Guardian: Gas and electricity prices will remain high and volatile until at least 2023. Compared to the outlook of last autumn, the situation has deteriorated. Along with the rest of the world, the EU has been grappling with soaring energy prices for months, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has provoked soul searching about Europe’s gas dependency. The union imports 40% of its gas from Russia, a figure unchanged in more than 15 years despite repeated gas crises triggered by Moscow cutting off supplies. The policy paper also confirms that EU competition authorities are investigating the Russian state energy company Gazprom for its “unusual business behaviour”. The Russian company’s EU storage facilities are only 16% full, compared with 44% for non-Gazprom storage, raising suspicions that the Kremlin is using gas as a geopolitical tool. Our main Ukraine-Russia war liveblog has more details. One of the ironies of the war in Ukraine is that the Kremlin’s finances benefit every time the crisis deepens, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes. After Saudi Arabia, Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and it is out on its own as an exporter of natural gas. Countries producing more oil and gas than they consume enjoy windfall gains when prices rise – and Russia falls into that category. Conversely, countries not self-sufficient in energy suffer when prices are high because costs for business rise and consumer spending power is squeezed. There is a lively debate about whether the US is self-sufficient in energy, but it is certainly a lot less dependent on imports than the European Union, which gets 40% of its natural gas from Russia. Europe is a lot more vulnerable to a loss of Russian energy supplies than the US, and that helps explain why the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is more cautious than Washington over extending the west’s sanctions regime to oil and gas – at least for now. Here’s Larry’s full analysis: Three more Russian billionaires have resigned from the board of the $22bn (£17bn) investment firm LetterOne after the EU imposed sanctions on its two biggest shareholders. The company, which owns the health retail chain Holland &amp; Barrett in the UK and a swathe of energy assets across Europe, said on Monday that German Khan, Alexei Kuzmichev and Andrei Kosogov had “resigned from all positions at LetterOne, including the board”. It said: “None of these three individuals has been sanctioned, but they believe that this is the right thing to do in the long-term interests of LetterOne, its employees and the many jobs it supports in its portfolio companies.” Last week the UK-based Russian billionaire oligarchs Mikhail Fridman, LetterOne’s founder, and Petr Aven, who between them own just under 50% of LetterOne, had their shares in the company “frozen” after they were hit with EU sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The pair then stepped down from the London-based investment group. Mervyn Davies, the company’s chair and a former Labour trade minister, said he was determined to stay on at L1, despite repeated calls for him to step down. “The new board and I will focus on protecting the enormous economic and social contribution LetterOne makes,” Lord Davies said. “I am also determined to ensure that the 120,000 jobs throughout the UK, US and Europe are protected. We know that everyone involved in L1, including our founders, would want us to take these steps given their love and passion for and heritage in Ukraine.” Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative MP and the chair of the foreign affairs committee, told the Mail on Sunday that Davies should step down. “Some moments demand a choice, this is one,” he said. Davies said LetterOne would make a $150m donation to “support the urgent work under way to help those affected by the war in Ukraine”. More here: Germany’s benchmark share index has fallen into a bear market, as the Ukraine war threatens to push Europe’s largest economy into recession. The DAX index of 40 leading German companies has closed 2% lower tonight, and more than 20% off its record closing high set in January. Germany’s reliance on Russian energy imports, and the pressure on banks and car manufacturers, means the DAX has been particularly hit by the escalating conflict in Ukraine. Today’s losses have left the Dax at its lowest level since November 2020, meaning it has lost all its gains since the succesful Covid-19 vaccine trials from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca spurred the global economic recovery last year. The Euro Stoxx 50 of ended 1.2% lower, also closing in a bear market. MIchael Hewson of CMC Markets says: In what has been a turbulent Monday session, European markets plunged sharply at the open on reports that the US was discussing the prospect of a total ban on Russian oil, which briefly sent Brent crude oil prices spiking up to $140 a barrel in Asia. This spike higher proved to be rather short-lived, but it also highlighted how fickle market sentiment is, and is likely to remain, and while prices have since retreated from those intraday highs, they are still up on the day. While the US could probably get away with banning oil imports, it is clear that the case for doing so in Europe is a much harder one to make, with Germany pushing back by saying it would not do so. The UK’s FTSE 250 index of medium-sized firm also racked up fresh losses today. It dropped 1.1% to a new 16-month low. Oxford Instruments, which makes x-ray tubes, optical imaging and microscopy tools, tumbled almost 23% after the rival precision equipment manufacturer Spectris abandoned its £1.8bn takeover offer today. Spectris blamed the market volatility sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying this morning: “With the invasion of Ukraine, the world has changed since our proposed offer was made regarding a combination of our businesses, bringing a high degree of uncertainty to the economic outlook around the world. “While we believe this combination is a great opportunity for both companies, the timing is no longer right and we have brought our discussions to a close.” Travel firms were also among the fallers, with easyJet down 7.5% and the package holiday group TUI 6.8% lower, while the real estate investment trust Hammerson fell almost 10%. After another day of market turmoil, the UK’s FTSE 100 index has finished the session at its lowest close in more than five months. The blue-chip index has closed 28 points lower at 6,959 points, the lowest close since September 2021, adding to last week’s losses (the index’s worst week since March 2020). The Ukraine crisis continued to hit banks, travel companies, retailers and consumer goods makers, on concerns that inflation will surge and growth will weaken, pushing up unemployment. The engineering group Melrose fell 6.7%, the insurer Prudential lost 6.1%, and the airline group IAG shed 5.9%, while NatWest and Lloyds dropped 4%. But the surge in commodity prices pushed up Shell (+8%) and BP (+3.8%), and miners such as Glencore (+3%). The Russian steel and mining business Evraz rose 28% but has still lost three-quarters of its value this year as the invasion of Ukraine led to a collapse in its share price. The UK tax authority has withdrawn petitions to close down four Liberty Steel companies, giving breathing space to the GFG Alliance metals empire presided over by Sanjeev Gupta. Gupta’s collection of metals companies, including steel, aluminium and energy plants, has been struggling for finance for a year since the collapse of its main lender, Greensill Capital. The companies are said to employ as many as 35,000 people around the world. The UK winding-up petitions, revealed last month, threatened the jobs of 3,000 workers across five plants, mostly in the north of England, including relatively large mills making speciality steel in Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire. That threat appears to have receded with the HMRC deal, although GFG also announced that workers at Liberty Pressing Solutions in Coventry had been put into consultations about a possible closure of the plant. The factory had 580 employees, according to its latest accounts, for 2019, but it is thought there are now only about 200 workers who could be made redundant. Gas prices have eased back from their morning surge but are still at painful, unprecedented levels. Wholesale natural gas for next-day delivery in the UK is now up 10% today at 515p per therm. That’s still a desperately high price, and more than 10 times higher than a year ago, having hit 670p/therm in early trading. The price of gas for delivery in April is now up 13% at 520p per therm, having hit an astonishing 800p earlier. The sanctions that have been imposed on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine could push up inflation and hit the UK economy, MPs heard today. Neil Shearing, the chief economist at Capital Economics, told the Treasury select committee that the sanctions could add an extra percentage point to UK inflation. Gross domestic product (GDP) might take a hit of between 0.25% to 0.5% because of the sanctions. This does not mean the economy will shrink, just that it will grow less rapidly, he told the committee. This is based on current sanctions, which include those on Russian banks and oligarchs. However, any future potential sanctions on energy are not included. Should the west sanction Russian oil and gas then these hits might be doubled, he said. “By far and away the most significant hit to the UK economy at the moment is going to come through the effect on energy prices and the cost of our imports, not because we import a lot from Russia, but because global prices have gone up.” MPs also heard that the UK was “in uncharted territory” over its sanctions against Russia, as Chloe Chaplain of the I newspaper reports: The US stock market has started the week with fresh falls. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 large US companies has dropped by over 1%, currently down 412 points at 33,202. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is down 1.3%, with travel stocks, banks, consumer goods makers and technology stocks all weaker, while energy stocks are rallying. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the Dutch PM, Mark Rutte, have signalled their opposition to a ban on Russian energy imports, which the US had been pushing for. At a Downing Street press briefing in London, Johnson said it was not possible to simply close down imports of oil and gas from Russia overnight – which rather chimes with Olaf Scholz’s statement. Johnson argued that countries should all move in the same direction and accelerate the move away from dependency on Russian energy supplies. He said: “I think there are different dependencies in different countries, and we have to be mindful of that. “And you can’t simply close down use of oil and gas overnight, even from Russia - that’s obviously not something every country around the world can do. “We can go fast in the UK, other countries can go fast, but there are different dependencies. “What we need to do is make sure we are all moving in the same direction, and we all share the same assumptions and we accelerate that move, and I think that is what you are going to see - you’ve heard that from leaders around the world. “But clearly there is going to be a transitional period, we are going to have to look for supply, we are going to have to look for substitute supplies from elsewhere and we are going to have to do it together across the entire coalition of countries that is now condemning Putin’s actions.” Rutte said there would be a “painful reality” as countries looked to move away from Russian energy dependency. He said sanctions must not create “unmanageable risks” to European energy supplies, but that over time Europe must reduce its reliance on Russian energy. Andrew Sparrow’s Politics Live blog has full details: Fears of European bans on Russian oil – and potential retaliation or follow-up moves in gas or other commodities – have subsided through today’s session, says Craig Erlam of OANDA. Having jumped 18% last night to $139 a barrel, Brent crude has now dropped back to around $123 – still up 4% today, meaning inflationary pressures are still intense. Gas prices have also eased a little, but the wholesale price of next-day delivery in the UK is still up 20% today at 565p per therm. Erlam explains: On the one hand, without German support, an EU ban on Russian oil imports looks highly unlikely and the pivot away will take years. But then there’s a lot that’s happened in the last couple of weeks that looked highly unlikely a month ago and the situation continues to evolve rapidly. The risks remain firmly tilted to the upside as far as oil prices are concerned. Downside risks primarily focus around Ukraine and Russia finding common ground and based on the current demands, that does not look likely any time soon. Bloomberg says Olaf Scholz has poured cold water on efforts within the EU to impose sanctions on Russia’s oil and gas sector (see last post). German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he opposes cutting off energy supplies from Russia, calling imports of oil and gas of “essential importance” to the European economy. While the European Union faces an urgent task of finding alternatives to Russian energy supplies, “this won’t happen overnight,” Scholz said Monday in a statement. “It’s therefore a conscious decision on our part to continue the activities of business enterprises in the area of energy supply with Russia.” Heating, transport and electricity cannot be secured in the short term without these imports, he added. More here: Germany Signals Opposition to Cutting ‘Essential’ Russian Energy The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has pushed back against calls to ban Russian oil and gas imports, as part of western sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. In a statement, Scholz cautioned that such a move could put Europe’s energy security at risk, and that energy imports from Russia were currently essential to citizens’ daily lives. Scholz said: “Europe has deliberately exempted energy supplies from Russia from sanctions. “Supplying Europe with energy for heat generation, mobility, electricity supply and industry cannot be secured in any other way at the moment. It is therefore of essential importance for the provision of public services and the daily lives of our citizens.” Scholz’s comments come a day after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the US was in talks with European allies about banning imports of Russian oil, to intensify the pressure on Moscow to halt its invasion of Ukraine. Blinken’s comments had sent Brent crude oil soaring to 14-year highs of $139 per barrel. But Brent has now dropped back to around $120, up 2% today. In his statement, Scholz defended a decision by the European Union to spare Russia’s energy sector from sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. He argued that Russian energy was needed until alternatives sources were found. “The federal government has been for months working urgently with its partners in the European Union and beyond to develop alternatives to Russian energy. “This cannot be done overnight.” Seperately, the finance minister, Christian Lindner, has said Germany is not currently planning to stop importing Russian oil, gas and coal but is keeping the option open. “This option is of course on the table,” Lindner told reporters (via Reuters). “At this point in time, however, it seems advisable for the sustainability of the sanctions against Vladimir Putin not to take this step ourselves.” Lindner added: “I do not rule out anything for later this year.” The National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) is announcing a “trailblazing” greener way of generating inertia in the electricity grid, to make the UK less reliant on gas supplies, including those from Russia, my colleague Rob Davies writes. If all goes to plan, it could also reduce carbon emissions, rein in household bills and recoup the £336m investment funding it. In the electricity system, inertia is crucial in maintaining a stable electrical frequency on the grid, keeping the lights on. In August 2019, more than 1 million people across the UK were plunged into darkness during one of the worst power blackouts in more than a decade, after the frequency of the grid fell from its usual 50Hz to 48.88Hz. That unprecedented loss of power generation was caused by a lightning strike, but outages can happen for other reasons too, causing a sudden shortfall that knocks the system’s frequency off kilter. As things stand, the grid system usually balances itself automatically thanks to the inertia held in massive spinning turbines at coal and gas power stations – much like a spinning top, but 19.5 metres (64ft) long and made of 300 tonnes of steel and aluminium. They respond instantaneously to a power outage happening elsewhere, spinning ever so slightly slower to offset the disruption and keep the system stable. However, these giant turbines are not a feature of wind or solar power generation, meaning that as the UK aims to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2025 as part of efforts to hit net zero, inertia needs to come from somewhere else. The solution, according to National Grid ESO, whose job it is keeps the electricity network in check, is a series of green turbines created to mimic the effect of their cousins at carbon-emitting fossil fuel plants. With only a small amount of energy fed into them, they can spin at the required rate of 3,000RPM, the speed that ensures synchronicity with the 50hz Grid system. The result, in theory, is a solution to the problem of creating inertia in an increasingly wind- and solar-powered electricity system, allowing for a faster push away from fossil fuels that emit carbon and line the pockets of countries such as Russia. Here’s the full story: UK gas prices are continuing to climb, with the day-ahead wholesale contract now up 41% today - to a record 660p per therm. That’s up from around 45p a year ago. After a fraught morning, European stock markets are recovering from their lowest levels this session. In the City, the blue-chip FTSE 100 is now down 0.4% or 30 points at 6966 points, having hit a seven-month low of 6,788 points in morning trading. Mining stocks and oil companies continue to rally, after oil hit its highest since 2008 and nickel prices soared as much as 30% to a 15-year high. Banks, travel companies, technology companies, retailers and consumer-goods makers are all still weaker, with grocery tech firm Ocado down 5.4%, drinks group Diageo down 4.4%, Next down 4.3% and Lloyds Banking Group 4.2% lower. Across Europe, Germany’s DAX is off 1% and France’s CAC is 0.8% lower, having both been down 4.5% at one point. Russia’s rouble has tumbled to a fresh record low today. Russia’s currency is down around 8% at 131 to the dollar, according to Refinitiv data. On the EBS trading platform, the rouble weakened as far as 141.00 to the dollar. The rouble started the year at around 75 to the US dollar, before plunging to record lows as the invasion of Ukraine began last month. Bid/offer spreads were between 10 and 15 cents, pointing to an increasingly illiquid market in thin trading, Reuters points out. Trading on the MOEX Moscow exchange is scheduled to be closed until Wednesday for a bank holiday. The possibility of a US ban on Russian crude imports adds to the heavy pressure on the rouble, with Russia’s economy facing a severe recession. Marc Ostwald, chief economist &amp; global strategist at ADM Investor Services, says: Leaving aside the official imposition of energy sanctions on Russia, there are already a large number of companies in the energy and many other sectors that are now ‘self-sanctioning’, i.e. halting all business with Russia, which will have a) devastating effects on the Russian economy; b) leaves many questions about whether there is capacity elsewhere to compensate for this loss of supply (oil, gas, fertiliser, grains, oilseeds, copper and palladium are just a few of these); c) may already lead start to result in involuntary inventory accumulation in some finished goods, but above all even more acute problems for the semiconductor sector, and per se auto and mobile phone makers. Investor morale across the eurozone has plunged, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Research group Sentix’s index of eurozone investor confidence fell to -7.0 in March from 16.6 the previous month, hitting its lowest level since November 2020. An expectations sub-index fell to -20.8 in March from 14.0 in February, the lowest reading in nearly a decade and the biggest drop in the Sentix index’s 20-year history. Sentix said the eurozone economy was being dramatically hit by the Ukraine crisis, adding that the eastern European region was particularly suffering. More here. Last weekend the president of the World Bank told the BBC that the war in Ukraine was “a catastrophe” for the world and would cut global economic growth. “The war in Ukraine comes at a bad time for the world because inflation was already rising,” said David Malpass, pointing out that rising energy and food prices hit the poorest hardest. Malpass stressed his biggest concern was “about the pure human loss of lives” that was occurring. Average petrol prices in the UK have exceeded 155p per litre for the first time as oil prices continue to soar due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Figures from data firm Experian Catalist show the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts on Sunday was 155.62p, while the price of diesel reached a record high of 161.28p. A year ago the price per litre of petrol and diesel was 124.32p and 127.25p respectively. Today’s rise in the oil price, with Brent crude hitting $139 per barrel before dropping back to $125/barrel now, could push prices even higher. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said (via PA Media) that: “These hikes are unprecedented and will sadly be hitting both homes and businesses hard. “It’s therefore vital the Chancellor acts quickly to limit the damage by cutting VAT to at least 15% which would save drivers 6.5p a litre and take the average price of unleaded back under £1.50. “Importantly, this could also limit the impact of inevitable fuel price rises in the coming days and weeks.” AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said the average petrol price rising above £7 a gallon was a “watershed moment” which means “it’s time to ditch petrol and diesel, and switch to electric” for drivers who can make the transition. “Although electricity is still susceptible to rising costs and market pressures, removing all those well-to-pump actors that can make a driver’s life a misery in a matter of weeks, will ensure a smoother ride with the cost of motoring - and a big saving initially.” EY has followed its rivals and fellow big four global accountancy firms, KPMG and PwC, by cutting off businesses in Russia and Belarus, piling pressure on Deloitte, which has yet to pull out. The businesses will not necessarily close down but they will be legally separated, in the latest example of multinational firms responding to the invasion of Ukraine by pulling out of Russia. KPMG has more than 4,500 workers and partners in Russia and Belarus, while PwC has 3,700 and EY has 4,700. KPMG and PwC confirmed the businesses will no longer be able to use their brands or name once separated. Companies across the world have been scrambling to work out their exposure to Russia after the US, EU and UK sought to isolate it economically with sanctions. None of those have imposed blanket bans on Russia or Belarus, which supported the invasion by its bigger ally, but many have judged that reputational or financial risks were too great. More here: This latest surge in energy prices will have an immediate impact on companies, driving up costs and creating the risk of demand destruction at energy-intensive companies. Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, says: The galloping commodity prices will naturally put downward pressure on the economy and increase operational volatility for many companies already struggling with inflationary pressures. An import ban on Russian oil and gas would immediately put Europe into a rationing mode to preserve and allocate oil and gas to the most important sectors of the economy first. If prices don’t come down, UK consumers would face another jump in energy bills this autumn. The price cap on UK bills will rise by 54% next month, taking the average bill up to £2,000. Experts have already predicted bills could rise again to as much as £3,000 in October when Ofgem next sets the price cap. The Conservative peer Greg Barker has resigned as chairman of EN+, the mining company part-owned by the sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Lord Barker, an energy minister in David Cameron’s government, oversaw a plan to help the firm respond to US government sanctions levelled against the company and Deripaska in 2018, when it sanctioned the oligarch over his alleged links to the Russian government. Deripaska has previously said the US allegations were based on “false rumour and innuendo”. Barker’s resignation comes amid intense scrutiny of companies linked to sanctioned Russian oligarchs, alleged by authorities in the US, EU and UK to be part of the system through which Vladimir Putin controls the Russian economy. Here’s the full story: Wholesale gas prices in the UK and in Europe have jumped to fresh record highs this morning, as the inflationary squeeze intensifies. The price of gas for delivery in the UK in April is up over 30% at 650p per therm, driven by concerns of supply disruption and sanctions on Russia. The contract surged as high as 800p in early trading, up from 460p on Friday. A year ago, gas was trading at around 40p per therm, before last autumn’s energy price crunch. Gas for next-day delivery in the UK has also hit a record high, up almost 30% at 605p per therm. European energy prices also hit fresh records after the U.S. said it was considering curbs on imports of Russian oil, a move that would add to supply fears across commodity markets. Benchmark gas prices jumped 79% to as high as €345 per megawatt-hour, as Bloomberg reports:: Dutch front-month gas, the European benchmark, soared to a high of 345 euros a megawatt hour, and was 74% higher at 335.04 euros as of 9:32 a.m. in Amsterdam. The U.K. equivalent contract rose 74% to an unprecedented 800 pence a therm. German month-ahead power surged 60% to 675 euros a megawatt-hour, also a record high “I’m lost for words,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. “By now only very few traders besides those who have a commercial interest is likely to be trading this market.” As oil and gas rockets in price and worries about the effect on global growth rise, the spectre of stagflation is hovering over financial markets, says Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Russia looks increasingly embedded in the conflict, and with relentless bombardments of Ukrainian cities and human tragedy continuing, speculation is that the US and Europe will retaliate by banning Russian energy exports. That would would have a richochet effect on their economies, with a supply squeeze on global markets, pushing up prices for industries across the board and making the cost of living crisis even more painful. This piles pressure on central bank policymakers, who are faced with the increasingly difficult tightrope to tread of trying to bring down inflation by raising rates, which will make overall costs more unbearable, potentially tipping economies back into a downturn. A barrel of Brent crude jumped 15% earlier to its highest point since 2008, spiking at $139, before settling back at just over $126. This is still a very uncomfortable level for companies and consumers who are set to pay the price in terms of yet higher higher transport costs. European natural gas prices have exploded since the start of the year and soared to fresh all time highs above €240 per megawatt-hour earlier today. If Russian exports are turned off, it will leave a huge gap in European energy needs, given the country accounts for more than 30% of the region’s natural gas imports. The Swiss National Bank has repeated its pledge to intervene on the currency markets if needed after the Swizz franc briefly rose above parity with the euro, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Reuters has the details: “The Swiss franc is currently sought after as a refuge currency, along with the US dollar and the yen,” the central bank said in a statement. “The Swiss franc continues to be highly valued,” it added. “The SNB remains prepared to intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary.” The euro/franc exchange rate fell to 0.9910 in Asia overnight, as investors sought refuge in the currency due to the conflict in Ukraine. The valuation is the highest level for the franc since January 2015 when the Swiss central bank scrapped its peg to the euro. The SNB said the increased valuation also recognised the inflation differentials between Switzerland and other countries. Britain’s more domestically-focused FTSE 250 index has fallen 3.75% this morning, to its lowest in over a year. Travel companies such as airline Wizz Air (-12%), holiday firm TUI (-9.7%), and ticket firm Trainline (-9%) are among the top fallers, along with Georgian bank TBC (-9.5%). High-tech manufacturer Oxford Instruments are down 25%, after British electrical engineering firm Spectris Plc ended talks regarding a possible bid for the company. The FTSE 250 is now at its lowest level since November 2020 (when Pfizer’s Covid vaccine success sparked a global rally), down 731 points at 18,655 points Eurozone bank shares are on track for their worst day since March 2020, Reuters reports, with the sector down 9.2% this morning. Europe’s auto sector has fallen to its lowest level since November 2020, falling around 6% today, and almost a quarter since the start of this year. The DAX index, of Germany’s largest companies, has fallen into bear market territory this morning. It’s down over 20% from its record highs last November. Europe’s stock markets have fallen to a fresh one-year low this morning, hit by the possibility of a US and European ban on Russian oil imports. The Stoxx 600 index of Europe’s largest 600 companies has fallen over 3%, taking its losses in 2022 to 16%. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC have both fallen by 4.5% this morning, with Italy’s FTSE MIB down almost 6%. Jim Reid, strategist at Deutche Bank, says the surge in the oil price has meant a fraught start to the week for markets. There hasn’t been much new news over the weekend that progresses the narrative on the conflict and it’s looking more likely that this will be an attritional battle absent a major development. For economies and markets, especially in Europe it then depends on whether the gas (and to a lesser extent oil) continues to flow from Russia to the continent. At the moment it seems the European governments are keen for the gas flow to continue (assuming Russia does) but I suppose a risk to this scenario is that public opinion becomes increasingly against that scenario and politicians have to respond. The news out of the US over the weekend shows the momentum is building for fiercer sanctions on Russia. In the City, the FTSE 100 index has dropped 2% in early trading, as fears over the Ukraine war continue to hammer shares. The blue-chip index is down 141 points at 6845 points, its lowest level since last September. Travel stocks are tumbling, with British Airways parent company IAG down 9%. Bank stocks are also sharply lower, with Lloyds, Barclays and NatWest falling over 8%. But miners and oil producers are surging, following the rise in commodity prices. Shell has jumped 4%, while Anglo American is up 5.8%. The UK’s Europe minister, James Cleverly, has said Britain will consider banning oil imports from Russia, after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States and Europe were exploring the idea (sending crude prices surging). Cleverly told Times Radio that: We import very, very little Russian hydrocarbons anyway. So that’s something that we will of course, consider. Our Ukraine liveblog has more details: Oil prices are approaching their all-time highs after the risk of a US and European ban on Russian crude threatened a stagflationary shock for world markets, my colleague Martin Farrer reports: Mohamed El-Erian, chief economist at the insurer Allianz, said that it appeared likely that the new sanctions would be imposed given the continued bombardment of Ukrainian cities. “It’s hard to see such sanctions not being imposed given the atrocities being committed against Ukraine,” he said on Twitter. Bank of America chief economist Ethan Harris said cutting off most of Russia’s energy exports would be a “major shock to global markets”, adding that the loss of Russia’s 5m barrels could see oil prices double to $200 a barrel. Mike Muller, of commodity trading firm Vitol, also said prices could rise further. “I don’t think we’ve priced in everything yet,” he said. Here’s the full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global financial markets are set for another day of turbulence as the war in Ukraine drives up the oil price towards record levels and threatens a stagflationary shock to Europe’s economy. Oil has surged to its highest level since 2008, after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was in “very active discussions” with European governments about banning imports of Russian crude and natural gas. Brent crude hit $139 a barrel overnight, a jump of 20%, before slipping back to around $129/barrel now --- still up 9% today. This surge has increased concerns that the world economy could face stagflation, with consumer prices surging, and slowing growth pushing up unemployment. Asia-Pacific markets have already slumped into the red again, with China’s CSI 300 index tumbling to a 20-month low. The world will experience an energy shock, it’s just now a question of how big it is and long it lasts, writes Kyle Rodda of IG: Equities seem to be having an “Oh (pick your expletive)” moment, as the US reportedly weighs an embargo on Russian oil that could strangle global growth, fuel inflation and accelerate the trend to a more multipolar world. Of course, this doesn’t have to come to fruition – sentiment improved this afternoon on reports that the path forward an embargo is “uncertain”. On top of that, the move, which would cripple the Russian economy, could in theory force a backdown from the Russians, and could open the door to a diplomatic solution that could see an end to war, even if that means some ugly land concessions to the Russians from Ukraine. But given the one eyed focus by Putin on toppling the Ukrainian government, it seems more likely this war will drag on, all at the expense of global growth and price stability. Although it’s too early to tell, this could be the realisation markets have come to today. Stocks are tumbling, the Euro has swooned, and commodity prices are going through the roof. The Ukraine war also increase the risk of recession in Europe, as Rodda adds: Commodity prices are soaring, in a mix that’s undoubtedly going to stoke big, scary headlines about stagflation going forward. And that’s not entirely unjustified, given the risk Europe slips into recession if the conflict drags-on, and as food and energy insecurity becomes more wide spread European markets are set for further heavy losses, adding to last week’s turmoil which saw London’s stock market suffer its biggest weekly losses since the start of the global pandemic in March 2020. The FTSE 100 is on track to drop over 1%, with other European indices facing deeper losses. As analysts at MUFG put it: There are growing signs in the financial markets that the fallout from sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine is spreading, with Europe in particular beginning to show contagion.

By the slimmest of majorities, voters defied the status quo, and the party that did the best job convincing the public it would honour their will collected the political rewards. The dynamic unleashed by the 2013 plebiscite on buying the local utility grids back from private providers helps to explain why the city state is expected to buck national trends at this Sunday’s elections. Polls predict the ruling centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), who are in decline across Germany, will hang on to their Hamburg stronghold with relative ease. Their junior coalition partner, the Green party, is expected to increase its share of the vote, leading to a strengthened mandate for the current power-sharing deal. The CDU of Angela Merkel is likely to drop into third place while the far-right Alternative für Deutschland may even struggle to make it above the 5% threshold for entry into the Hamburg parliament. Yet a centre-left success in the city state is more likely to be the result of local factors than national trends. In September 2013, 51% of the electorate voted to “re-municipalise” the local electricity and district heating networks, as proposed by grassroots initiative “Our Hamburg Our Grid”. And while the energy debate has only played a minor role in this year’s election campaign, it has increased the profile of the two governing parties. For one, Hamburg has managed to get de-privatisation done. In Berlin, by contrast, the senate announced its intention to buy back the district heating grid but has so far failed to drive the project through the courts. Hamburg sealed a €650m (£545m) deal last September. For Hamburg’s SPD – which campaigned against re-municipalisation, and is widely seen as more pro-business than elsewhere in the country – the buy-back has helped show it can also apply its famed pragmatism to more traditionally leftwing projects. The local party has been quicker to discover its green heart than other SPD branches in the country. And on Thursday, Hamburg’s SPD mayor, Peter Tschentscher, surprised his Green coalition partners by proposing to shut one coal unit at the city’s Moorburg power plant and convert the second to gas, in addition building a 100MW electrolyser to produce green hydrogen at the site. “If we hadn’t listened to voters, we would have been punished,” said Matthias Ederhof, an SPD candidate on the regional party list. “We are on the up because voters see us as competent.” The re-municipalised electricity grid, for which Hamburg paid the Swedish energy group Vattenfall €610m, has been making the city senate a healthy profit since 2017. The Greens are finding that having utility grids in public hands allows them to propose initiatives that would otherwise have sounded like pipe dreams. Hamburg, a city whose wealth has historically grown around its inland port, has in recent years turned into a busy laboratory for renewable energy schemes. Hamburg is now the first state in Germany to write a legally binding date into its constitution, the year 2030, not just for halving its carbon emissions from 1990 levels, but also for phasing out coal power for district heating altogether. The 250,000 households in the city which use district heating are still powered by coal stations in Wedel and Tiefstack. In the future, the Greens propose, Hamburg homes will be heated entirely from renewable sources such as waste incineration, biomass or solar power. There is a proposal to build a large heat storage system underneath the harbour, capturing excess heat produced in the summer for use during the winter by pumping hot salt water hundreds of meters deep into the soil. Even an old air raid bunker in the Wilhelmsburg district has been transformed into a so-called “energy bunker”, with a large heat reservoir. The city has the highest number of charging points for electric cars in Germany, more than Berlin or Munich. If Hamburg’s utility grid was still owned by Vattenfall, such experiments would have been unthinkable, said Christian Maass, a former state secretary for the environment and urban planning. “Private monopolies become a problem especially when the state doesn’t have the power and capacity to regulate them. In Hamburg, it therefore made more sense for the senate to hold the monopoly, because politicians can be held to account much more effectively than private companies,” said Maass, who now works as consultant on renewable energy. “Expectations on state-owned energy or heating grids are much more long-term and less orientated around maximising profit. If you want to shape the future of a city, that’s an immeasurable advantage.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/mar/12/wind-and-solar-plants-will-soon-be-cheaper-than-coal-in-all-big-markets-around-world-analysis-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-12T00:00:16Z","webTitle":"Wind and solar plants will soon be cheaper than coal in all big markets around world, analysis finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/12/wind-and-solar-plants-will-soon-be-cheaper-than-coal-in-all-big-markets-around-world-analysis-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/mar/12/wind-and-solar-plants-will-soon-be-cheaper-than-coal-in-all-big-markets-around-world-analysis-finds","fields":{"headline":"Wind and solar plants will soon be cheaper than coal in all big markets around world, analysis finds","bodyText":"Building new wind and solar plants will soon be cheaper in every major market across the globe than running existing coal-fired power stations, according to a new report that raises fresh doubt about the medium-term viability of Australia’s $26bn thermal coal export industry. While some countries are moving faster than others, the analysis by the Carbon Tracker Initiative, a climate finance thinktank, found renewable power was a cheaper option than building new coal plants in all large markets including Australia, and was expected to cost less than electricity from existing coal plants by 2030 at the latest. Solar photovoltaics and wind energy were already cheaper than electricity from about 60% of coal stations, including about 70% of China’s coal fleet and half of Australia’s plants, it said. In Japan, where Australia sells nearly half its exported thermal coal, wind power was found to cost less than new coal plants and was expected to be cheaper than existing coal by 2028. Solar power in Japan was forecast to be a better option than new coal by 2023 and existing coal by 2026. The story was similar in China and South Korea, which each take about 15% of Australia’s exported thermal coal. In China, wind was already cheaper than any coal power, and solar electricity was forecast to on average cost less than existing coal later this year. Renewable energy in South Korea was expected to be cheaper than existing coal within two years. The report acknowledged this trend did not necessarily mean coal power would be pushed from the market within a decade. It said some governments were effectively incentivising or underwriting new coal power through regulatory programs that either directly subsidised coal operators or passed the higher cost on to consumers. But the group found that coal power would struggle if markets were priced fairly. It called on governments to block new coal projects and phase our existing coal plants, in part by changing regulations to allow renewable energy to compete on a level playing field. Carbon Tracker’s Matt Gray, a co-author of the report, said proposed coal investments risked becoming stranded assets that locked in increasingly expensive power for decades. The analysis found that developers risked wasting more than $600bn if all mooted coal-fired plants were built. “The market is driving the low-carbon energy transition but governments aren’t listening,” Gray said. “It makes economic sense for governments to cancel new coal projects immediately and progressively phase out existing plants.” Christiana Figueres, a former head UN climate chief who oversaw negotiations on the Paris agreement and is in Australian on a book tour, said demand for coal had been diminishing, having been overtaken by cheaper gas-fired power in the US and outpriced by solar in India. She said the price of solar and onshore and offshore wind were falling consistently. “No one should not assume that the demand for thermal coal from Australia is actually elastic. It’s not,” Figueres said. Australia is the world’s second largest thermal coal exporter after Indonesia, and is the biggest trader in metallurgical coal, which is used in steel making. The export value of both forms of coal dropped notably last year. The spot price of thermal coal slumped more than a third from US$100.73 to US$66.20, its biggest fall in more than a decade. Before the coronavirus outbreak, the government’s latest resources and energy quarterly report estimated the declining price would cut earnings from thermal coal exports from a record A$26bn in 2018-19 to A$20.6bn this financial year. In terms of coal use, the International Energy Agency found it declined last year, but forecast a slight increase over the next five years due to rising demand from India. A more detailed analysis by several thinktanks found that coal-fired electricity fell about 3% in 2019, the biggest drop on record after more than four decades of near-uninterrupted growth in which coal power has been a primary driver of the climate crisis. China’s use of coal plants continued to climb while generation in the US and Europe fell by 16% and nearly a quarter. Within Australia, black and brown coal provide about two-thirds of the electricity used in the five eastern states, but this is expected to fall as old plants continue to close. According to federal government projections, renewable energy is expected to meet nearly 50% of national demand by 2030. In 2018 the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change examined how rapidly global coal power needed to be phased out to give the world a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C , a goal referenced in the Paris agreement. It found this would require a cut of 59% to 78% below 2010 levels by 2030, before declining to zero."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2020/nov/01/a-2000km-road-trip-through-north-west-nsw-hot-bore-baths-ancient-traps-and-chaotic-courtesy-buses","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-31T19:00:04Z","webTitle":"A 2,000km road trip through north-west NSW: hot bore baths, ancient traps and chaotic courtesy buses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/01/a-2000km-road-trip-through-north-west-nsw-hot-bore-baths-ancient-traps-and-chaotic-courtesy-buses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/01/a-2000km-road-trip-through-north-west-nsw-hot-bore-baths-ancient-traps-and-chaotic-courtesy-buses","fields":{"headline":"A 2,000km road trip through north-west NSW: hot bore baths, ancient traps and chaotic courtesy buses","bodyText":"Many borders are closed but Australians are still travelling, swapping our top three destinations of New Zealand, Bali and the United States for our own backyards instead. In pandemic times, demand is up for vehicles in which people can BYO bathroom, bed and kitchen. In preparation for our trip around north-west New South Wales, we sourced a motorhome through CampToo, an online service that connects road-trippers with privately owned vehicles. Ours was equipped with solar power, meaning we could stay in “primitive” (non-powered) sites. In a regular car or a 4WD, your itinerary may differ to this – notably, you’d have better access to national park campgrounds and to experiences such as Lightning Ridge’s pubs in the scrub, down a dirt road. View this loop of north-west NSW as a choose-your-own-adventure, and this story as the highlight reel of ours. As we planned the trip – and on town plaques while on the road – we saw the phrase “Aboriginal history” a lot, locked in past tense. Yet in this year of domestic travel, Australia’s majority non-Indigenous population should remember these aren’t “our” backyards. Indigenous sovereignty was never ceded, though this truth is not made plain. So what about the present, you might wonder? Sydney to Dubbo via the Golden Highway (6 hours) My hesitations about taking a preloved vehicle evaporate when its owner demonstrates how to operate his professionally cleaned Volkswagen, saving us the trials and errors of an enigmatic rental.

Phil, practiced in jujitsu, tells us about a traditional Aboriginal form of wrestling called “coreeda”, based partially on the red kangaroo’s “oldest wrestling method of all time”. Peter tells us about the boomerangs found in Tutankhamen’s tomb. He should be in Cairo this month, participating in the opening ceremony of the new Grand Egyptian Museum but, Covid. “Peter Peckham?” says Phil, admiringly. “Legendary world traveller.” Don’t miss: Peter Peckham’s First Lesson Cultural Tours Eat at: Press cafe Stay at: NRMA holiday park and resort Dubbo to Narrabri via the Pilliga (3 hours) ”The Pilliga” in Gamilaraay country is Australia’s largest remaining native forest. Misty rain is falling when we meet ranger Bernadette Lai at the sandstone caves loop walk – and she couldn’t be happier. “The Pilliga is known for its flowering season but it skipped the last few years because of drought,” Lai says. The wildflowers pop bright and glossy in the wet: hot-pink boronia, fluffy yellow wattle, the origami of purple pea and a few elusive orchids. Carnivorous sundews grow in damp spots here too. At the request of elders, the caves are not signposted and a discovery tour ($15) is recommended. Sacred scar trees are dotted through this ancient landscape and the kangaroo and emu footprint etchings in the caves are up to 12,000 years old. I learn that national parks are dedicated to humans’ enjoyment but the welfare of plants and wildlife is put first in nature reserves. Pilliga nature reserve is often closed in August, for example, to allow the peregrine falcon to nest in peace. Narrabri is the inland halfway point between Melbourne and Brisbane and when we arrived it was still reeling from a winter influx of pre-lockdown Victorian motorhomes fleeing for Queensland. When the town’s caravan parks filled up it opened the fairgrounds to accommodate the travellers. Like every town on our trip, Covid measures are strict with non-negotiable sign-ins and hand sanitiser on entry.

I’d rather see the rare fluorescent pink slug so we head to Sawn Rocks instead. This spectacular, volcanic rock cliff has eroded into what looks like a pipe organ. Beneath it, hexagonal shards have crashed into the bush, resembling a Roman ruin, mouldering into antiquity. Meanwhile, NSW’s network of seven artesian bore baths is a revelation. Because the baths are hot and healing they’re a hit on the grey nomad trail. Council-run, utilitarian and stubbornly un-Instagrammable, they’re also a reminder that luxury can come for free. Our baptism at Burren Junction is an extremely rural experience as the baths’ denuded red earth is smack in the middle of fields that may be cotton, chick pea or wheat. My crop ID skills are bad but I know an octogenarian holding a pool noodle when I see one. We get pruney in the sulphurous waters together; both a literal and a cultural immersion. An hour away, Walgett’s baths are less anarchic, fenced off in tidy Apex Park. Road trains stuffed with hay thunder by as we soak with a local guy and his toddler. He’s a footy player and a farmhand and both warrant a daily soak. “Lightning Ridge’s baths are better,” he says. “Hotter. Everyone’s friendly. No one cares what colour you are.” Don’t miss: Norman Tracker Walford Walkway Stay at: Alex Trevallion Park camping ground (free) Eat at: Stones Throw cafe Walgett to Lightning Ridge (1 hour) The sign in Alex Trevallion Park – a “primitive” campground on Walgett’s outskirts – documents the 1965 Freedom Ride: the civil rights bus tour of rural NSW led by Arrernte man, activist and University of Sydney student, Charles Perkins. Its efforts to highlight racial injustice boiled over in Walgett when the bus was run off the road by a hostile convoy of cars. The Dharriwaa Elders Group made this sign in 2015 so “the Walgett community will not forget”. But has the rest of the country? Walgett could be considered the civil rights equivalent of Selma, Alabama, yet a marble monument to the soldiers of the Great War occupies the main junction, soaring above town. Driving to Lightning Ridge, we clear the farming belt for the big-sky outback of Yuwaalaraay country. “There are Dreamtime stories that talk about the creation of opal,” the Australian Opal Centre notes. It’s all about opals here. While miners mine, tourists are kept busy doing colour-coded self-drive tours. Essentially, you fang down either the blue, green, red or yellow route and pop out at whichever (largely opal-themed) attraction appeals, advertised by a car door jammed in the dirt. At our campground’s firepit, near the Willy (not Nelson) Pavilion, we roast marshmallows with some kids whose dad says the tourists who disembarked the Black Opal bus yesterday were “pissed as nits”. The tour goes 40km into the “moonscape” to pubs in the scrub, a circuit we regretfully save for next time (our motorhome can’t do long dirt roads). That night, our courtesy bus into town hammers down a dirt road to return a pub punter to a cottage made, seemingly, from tin and a few venetian blinds. Turns out he owns the walk-in mine.

Our off-grid afternoon is spent on a sharp bend in the Barwon River at the isolated jetty at Four Mile Reserve. Sunlight glints off the water, gliding across the knotty gums above. Birds most commonly seen in cages, budgerigars and cockatiels, fly wild and free here, screeching and swooping above with galahs, finches and a restless flycatcher or two. At dusk, a sole squat pelican floats ostentatiously by. Bruce Pascoe’s 2014 book Dark Emu renewed attention to Baiame’s Ngunnhu (Brewarrina fish traps), which are described by some as the oldest human construction in existence. These still-working stone traps, and their associated ochre pit and burial grounds, are linked to the Ngemba, Ualarai, Morowari, Kamilaroi, Baranbinja, Weliwan, Kula and Koama people. Tour guide and Ngemba man Bradley Hardy stresses the traps’ significance but is wary of categories such as “oldest” and how it frames antiquity as a competition. “Our old people taught us we don’t own land, we belong to it,” he says, gently but firmly shifting the perspective. “They shared land, they shared waterways. We shared everything. That’s why we’re still here.” Don’t miss: Brewarrina visitors centre for local souvenirs Eat at: Muddy Waters cafe Stay at: Four Mile Reserve (free) Brewarrina to Bourke (1 hour) Speaking of competing, who gets to be “gateway to the outback”? Broken Hill claims the title too, so Bourke has upped the stakes as “gateway to the real outback”. Bourke is 760km from Sydney. Taking in the milky green of the Darling River on the Jandra paddle steamer is a popular outing, but we meet Kooma man George Orcher for a cultural walk instead. Talk with any Indigenous person in north-west NSW and other places will come up too, such was their dispossession from their homelands. Raised in remote Weilmoringle, George was the only one of 10 siblings to go to boarding school. “I still became a shearer like my dad and my brothers,” he says. By the 1880s, Bourke was the world’s largest inland port for wool export – even Henry Lawson swagged and sheared here a while. George’s record was 204 sheep in a day. His dad did 327. “It would have made the Guinness Book of Records but he was Aboriginal so he couldn’t claim it,” George says. Early the next day we drive an hour from town to the unmissable Gundabooka national park on Ngemba and Paakandji country. There, our senses are stuffed deliriously full of red earth, purple-blue sky and a wealth of wildflowers. “This is stone country,” an entry sign reads, but it’s far from arid with Pillaga posies carpeting the scrub in abundance. Exiting, another sign, just two words. “Yata wiitya,” it reads in Ngiyampaa language. Go well. We return to Sydney via Nyngan Riverside Tourist park on the banks of the Bogan River.

The plant, being developed by Drax in north Yorkshire, would become the biggest gas power station in Europe and could produce 75% of the UK’s power sector emissions when fully operational, according to the environmental lawyers ClientEarth, who have brought the judicial review. The planning inspectorate recommended to ministers that the 3.6GW gas plant was to be refused permission because it “would undermine the government’s commitment, as set out in the Climate Change Act 2008, to cut greenhouse emissions” by having “significant adverse effects”. It was the first big project rejected because of the climate crisis. However, Andrea Leadsom, secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, rejected the advice and gave the go-ahead in October. Now ClientEarth has been given permission by the high court to sue ministers, with the case expected to be heard in about two months. The environmental lawyers have previously inflicted three defeats on ministers over their failure to tackle air pollution. “With scientists ringing the alarm bells for decades, we shouldn’t need to take the government to court over its decision,” said Sam Hunter Jones, a lawyer at ClientEarth. “[Leadsom’s] decision is at odds with the government’s own climate change plans. As the planning inspectorate found, if this plant goes ahead the public risks a carbon budget blowout, or a huge stranded asset that would require propping up by the taxpayer, or a combination of the two.” A Drax spokeswoman said the company’s ambition was to be removing, not adding carbon to the atmosphere, by 2030. It would do this by burning wood or plants and then capturing and storing the emissions. She said Drax’s carbon negative ambition could be achieved alongside “new, high efficiency gas power capacity as part of our portfolio” and provide electricity when the wind was not blowing or the sun shining. The UK government’s actions to tackle the climate emergency are under particular scrutiny this year as it will host a vital UN summit in Glasgow in November. The world’s nations must dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions at the summit to avoid a disastrous 3-4C rise in global temperatures. The government is to bring its environment bill before parliament on Thursday, which it said underlined its commitment to tackling the climate crisis. The Guardian revealed last week that more than 90% of the £2bn in energy deals struck at a UK-Africa investment summit were for fossil fuels. In its planning application, Drax said its proposal for four new gas turbines was warranted to replace its existing two coal-fired units ahead of the government’s proposed phase-out of coal in 2025. It said the new gas plant would be “capable” of having carbon capture technology fitted in the future. In overruling the planning inspectorate, Leadsom argued that the plant’s high carbon emissions were not a reason to block approval under the existing rules. “While the significant adverse impact of the proposed development on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted to atmosphere is acknowledged, the policy set out in the relevant National Policy Statements makes clear that this is not a matter that should displace the presumption in favour of granting consent.” ClientEarth says the government’s latest forecasts estimate the UK will need 6GW of new gas generation up to 2035. The UK has already approved more than 15GW of large-scale gas plants, it said, so approving Drax’s project would take this to three times the government’s estimates. The environmental lawyers argued the combination of the project’s large scale, level of carbon emissions and long operating life made it a significant threat to the UK’s carbon targets. The planning inspectorate also concluded that wind and solar power would cut payers’ bills, while the proposed gas plant would not. “Both [Drax] and [National Grid] confirmed that it is the production of renewable plants that will deliver cheaper energy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/nov/13/climate-change-do-more-now-or-risk-catastrophe-warns-energy-agency","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-13T00:01:06Z","webTitle":"Climate change: do more now or risk catastrophe, warns energy agency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/13/climate-change-do-more-now-or-risk-catastrophe-warns-energy-agency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/nov/13/climate-change-do-more-now-or-risk-catastrophe-warns-energy-agency","fields":{"headline":"Climate change: do more now or risk catastrophe, warns energy agency","bodyText":"The world’s existing climate policies will not be enough to end the upward march of record energy emissions rising beyond 2040 without a “grand coalition” of governments and investors, according to the global energy watchdog. The International Energy Agency said carbon emissions from the global energy industry reached a new record in 2018 despite progress in renewable energy in recent years. The IEA expects the growth of renewables to accelerate over the coming decades, but warned it would not be enough to put a ceiling on the energy sector’s emissions before 2040. Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said there was a “deep disparity” between the aim to tackle the climate crisis by curbing carbon emissions and the existing policies which had allowed a “relentless upward march” for emissions. The IEA’s latest figures estimate that carbon emissions are on track to keep rising by 100m tonnes a year for at least another 20 years under existing policy plans. This rate would be two-thirds slower than the emissions hikes recorded in previous decades, but would fall very far short of what is needed to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement. “We will need to see great political will around the world,” Birol said. “This is why I believe that the world needs to build a grand coalition encompassing governments, investors, companies and everyone else who is genuinely committed to tackling climate change.” The IEA said it presented the modelling based on stated policies to “hold up a mirror” to global governments to show the consequences of their policies. “We think that governments’ current plans could bring us to a catastrophic implications for the climate of this planet. In order to be in line with the Paris targets there is a need for huge efforts in pushing energy efficiency, renewable energy and all other clean energy technologies,” Birol added. The record carbon emissions for 2018 are only marginally below the levels forecast by the IEA almost 10 years ago despite the quicker than expected rollout of wind and solar power. Birol said the “disappointing” efforts towards better energy efficiency and a boom in coal use in China had scuppered the momentum of clean-energy technologies. Energy efficiency is one of the most important levers for policymakers to help reduce carbon emissions across the economy, according to the IEA’s report, yet efforts to cut energy waste have fallen to record lows even as the climate crisis has climbed the political agenda. Under the IEA’s sustainable development model, global carbon emissions from the energy sector should peak immediately and fall to 10 gigatonnes (or 10bn tonnes) by 2050. This would require emissions in advanced economies to fall at an average of 5.6% every year until 2050, and by 3.2% in developing economies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2020/jul/13/10-of-the-uks-best-rural-summer-holidays-for-families","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-13T15:30:23Z","webTitle":"10 of the UK's best rural summer holidays for families","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jul/13/10-of-the-uks-best-rural-summer-holidays-for-families","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2020/jul/13/10-of-the-uks-best-rural-summer-holidays-for-families","fields":{"headline":"10 of the UK's best rural summer holidays for families","bodyText":"Aislabeck plantation, North Yorkshire Architecturally striking but homely, these two modern lodges sit side-by-side in a peaceful private woodland valley close to the market town of Richmond.

If we are to stand any chance of meeting this target, known as “net zero”, there is one enormous challenge that we will have to tackle: home heating. Warming our homes is responsible for between a quarter and a third of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. That’s more than 10 times the amount of CO2 created by the aviation industry. Around 85% of homes now use gas-fired central heating, and a large proportion of gas cooking still takes place. Greening this system is a huge challenge by any measure. But if recent reports are to be believed, there could be a simple and efficient way to do it: change from using natural gas to hydrogen gas. Hydrogen is abundant in the natural world and according to its advocates could power the next generation of gas appliances cleanly and efficiently. “The attraction of hydrogen is that for a lot of consumers, they wouldn’t notice any difference. Customers would continue to use a boiler to heat their homes in a similar manner to natural gas,” says Robert Sansom of the Institution of Engineering and Technology’s energy policy panel. He is the lead author on a study conducted by the institute called Transitioning to Hydrogen. Together with colleagues, Sansom assessed the engineering risks and uncertainties associated with swapping our gas network to hydrogen. Their conclusion is that there is no reason why repurposing the gas network to hydrogen cannot be achieved. That’s not to say it would be easy, though. Technological and practical hurdles exist because there is no blueprint for such a conversion: there is nowhere in the world that supplies pure hydrogen to homes and businesses. The UK would have to pioneer everything. Interest in hydrogen as a way to heat homes began in 2016 with a report called H21. It was conducted by Northern Gas Networks, the gas distributor for the north of England, and looked at whether it was technically possible and economically viable to convert Leeds to 100% hydrogen instead of natural gas. “They went into a lot of detail, from the hydrogen production plants right the way down to people’s homes,” says Sansom. The report drew a parallel to the way the gas industry converted from town gas to natural gas in the 1960s and 70s. Town gas was a combination of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. It was mostly produced from the distillation of coal and oil and had been used for the first 150 years of the UK’s gas industry. With the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea, which is predominantly methane, the UK undertook a nationwide programme to convert 40m appliances over a decade. Whole streets would be converted at a time. Engineers would inspect the gas appliances, and then convert them. Simultaneously, the town gas was disconnected and the pipelines were purged with an inert gas. Finally, the natural gas was pumped into the system and the engineers would make sure each appliance worked correctly before moving to the next street along. Some manufacturers are now so convinced that a similar thing can happen with hydrogen that they have already begun to develop new household appliances. In February, Worcester Bosch unveiled the prototype of its hydrogen-ready boiler. It would run first on natural gas and then, after a servicing visit, hydrogen. Also working in hydrogen’s favour is that for the past 20 years, the gas industry has been systematically replacing the metal pipes in its “iron mains” network with yellow polyethylene ones. Around 90% of the pipes will have been replaced by 2030. This is good news for hydrogen because the gas reacts with the old metal pipes, making them brittle. But the polyethylene is safe. “Effectively we started a programme of hydrogen-proofing our gas network without knowing we were doing it,” says Sansom, who found himself becoming more and more impressed by the concept. “From a personal point of view, I was very much on the fence when I kicked off with this work. But I found myself slipping down on the hydrogen side in terms of its viability as a low carbon alternative to natural gas,” he says. But not everyone is convinced by this sudden interest in hydrogen. Richard Lowes of the University of Exeter Energy Policy Group says that until recently the received wisdom had been that heating would have to be electrified in some way to meet our climate-crisis commitments. “That has basically come out of years and years of technical and economic modelling to look at how you get to fully decarbonised heating in the UK,” says Lowes. Switching heating from gas to electricity would mean relying on heat pumps. These use electricity to extract heat from either the air or the ground. In the case of an air source heat pump, it works like a fridge but instead of sucking heat out of a food compartment, it pulls it out of the air and channels it into the home, where it is used to heat water, which is piped to radiators for central heating, and stored in a tank for hot water. But because this technology works at a lower temperature than existing boilers, it requires many homes to be much better insulated, or to have larger radiators, capable of delivering more heating power. For those who have switched to heat-as-you-go combi boilers, it will necessitate the reinstallation of a hot water tank. It’s extensive work but worth it, according to Lowes, who has removed his own gas boiler and is now using an air source heat pump to heat his home. “It was a lot of work but my home and heating system are now a lot more efficient. It’s always warm, there’s always hot water and it’s basically the same cost to run as gas,” he says. The third approach is called district heating. It envisages water being heated at a central facility using waste heat from industry or green sources such as solar power. The hot water is then delivered to many homes simultaneously through a network of heavily insulated underground pipes. Both methods can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of home heating but the downside is that they require extensive work to roll them out on a national scale. District heating would require water pipes to be laid under homes, and the widespread use of heat pumps would necessitate the National Grid’s electricity circuits being upgraded. It is this kind of disruption that hydrogen’s advocates say could be avoided because much of the national infrastructure has already been upgraded. That argument cuts no ice with Lowes. “It seems a bit hypocritical for the gas industry to say we can’t dig up the roads when they’ve been doing it for the past 20 years,” he says. He points out that although the consumer may not experience so much disruption, significant challenges for the gas industry remain. For example, the National Transmission System, which is the network of pipes that supplies gas from the coastal terminals to the gas distribution companies and other major users, is made of metal. This would need to be protected from embrittlement in some way before any switch to hydrogen could take place. “Hydrogen is certainly not a silver bullet,” says Lowes. And if we get distracted by it, we could be getting ourselves into more trouble, missing the 2050 energy target altogether. But if there is so much uncertainty with hydrogen, why is the gas industry, which funds many of the studies, pushing it so hard? According to Chris Goodall, energy economist and author of What We Need to Do Now for a Zero Carbon Future, it is a matter of survival. “They do not wish for their industry to be eaten up by a switch to electricity for heating. So they are moving as fast as they can to persuade us about hydrogen,” he says. And it all comes down to how the gas is produced. Hydrogen is not found on Earth in a pure state. Instead, it has to be extracted from other substances, and the best one to extract it from is methane – in other words natural gas. Hence, the gas companies could effectively keep their current operations running. But the extra steps involved in extracting the hydrogen would push the price up. Additionally, the extraction creates carbon dioxide as a byproduct, so large scale carbon capture technology would need to be developed to prevent it escaping into the atmosphere. Although this is a technology that the UK will have to develop anyway in order to reach net zero by 2050, it will add to the cost. But natural gas is not the only substance that contains hydrogen. Water does too, and the hydrogen can be freed by a process called electrolysis, which doesn’t create any carbon dioxide. To make it totally green, which is the ultimate hope, electrolysis could be powered by wind farms. At the moment, however, the price of such electricity is expensive, and that would push the price of hydrogen up still further. Goodall hopes that the cost will decrease as technology improves, but warns: “You can be accused of mindless optimism just by saying this.” The UK’s future energy landscape is without doubt a difficult realm to navigate. Perhaps the best route will be revealed by not pitting the various solutions against one another. “All three have strengths and weaknesses and I expect that there’ll be a major role for each as a replacement for natural gas,” says Sansom. Even hydrogen’s detractors acknowledge this. “As a niche technology it can have real value,” says Lowes. He goes on to paraphrase the Heineken lager adverts of the 70s and 80s, saying that hydrogen could potentially reach the parts of the country that other energy solutions can’t. Goodall also sees a role for hydrogen to “store” energy generated from renewable resources such as wind and solar power. The idea is that in windy months, any extra electricity generated from renewables will be used to make hydrogen, which would then be stored. When there is extra demand on the National Grid, or a seasonal drop in the power produced from renewables, the hydrogen can be burned to produce electricity. The truth is that all options for us to decarbonise our heating systems will require significant disruption and cost. And while government continues to deliberate, the clock ticks towards 2050. “There is no need to wait. We can deploy stuff now that works fine,” says Lowes, referring to his own experience of changing his gas boiler for a heat pump. “The urgency of climate change means there really isn’t any reason to delay.” Others believe that there is a role for hydrogen and think it is worth taking a little more time to consider. But there is one truth that everyone agrees upon. “None of this is easy. If anyone is saying to you this is easy, they are misleading you,” says Lowes. Hydrogen-powered cars Hydrogen can also power vehicles, but in a different way than it would heat houses. Instead of being burned, the hydrogen reacts with oxygen inside a device called a fuel cell. Electricity and water are produced. The electricity runs the car, the water drips from the exhaust pipe. An attempt to switch to hydrogen vehicles in the 1990s was thwarted byelectric cars, which store their energy in an onboard battery. But a new push for hydrogen vehicles is coming from Asia. China, Japan and South Korea have all set ambitious goals to have millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on their roads by 2030. Toyota and Hyundai are both offering hydrogen vehicles in the UK, but there are currently less than 20 hydrogen filling stations across the UK, mostly clustered around the M25. “It will be really interesting to see what happens,” says Lowes. But he himself is not convinced: “Hydrogen is much more expensive than electricity, and the car is more expensive than the electric vehicle.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/oct/14/rise-renewables-oil-firms-decades-earlier-think","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-14T15:23:39Z","webTitle":"Rise of renewables may see off oil firms decades earlier than they think","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/14/rise-renewables-oil-firms-decades-earlier-think","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/oct/14/rise-renewables-oil-firms-decades-earlier-think","fields":{"headline":"Rise of renewables may see off oil firms decades earlier than they think","bodyText":"The world’s rising reliance on fossil fuels may come to an end decades earlier than the most polluting companies predict, offering early signs of hope in the global battle to tackle the climate crisis. The climate green shoots have emerged amid a renewable energy revolution that promises an end to the rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, before the fossil fuels face a terminal decline. The looming fossil fuel peak is expected to emerge decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies, which are betting that demand for polluting energy will rise until the 2040s. But energy experts are adjusting their forecasts as clean energy technologies, including wind and solar power, emerge faster than predicted and at costs that pose a direct threat to coal-fired electricity and combustion-engine vehicles. In the UK, renewable energy projects generated more electricity over the last quarter than fossil fuels for the first time since the country’s first public power plant fired up in 1882. It is a marked change from only 10 years ago, when gas and coal generated more than 70% of the UK’s electricity. The pace of progress has raised hope that the global groundswell of climate protest could spark fresh political will to accelerate the energy transition in time to keep global temperatures from rising to levels that could trigger a climate catastrophe. The UK Labour party has promised a Green Industrial Revolution to create almost 70,000 new jobs while working to create a carbon-neutral economy by 2030. In the US, the Green New Deal, spearheaded by the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, aims to virtually eliminate the US’s greenhouse gas emissions within the next decade. Within the energy industry, experts believe the rapid rise of renewable energy in recent years may soon seem glacial compared with the changes to come. Michael Liebreich, the founder of the research group Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), says the substitution of old technology with new is always “like waiting for a sneeze”. “The first 1% takes forever, 1% to 5% is like waiting for a sneeze – you know it’s inevitable but it takes longer than you think – then 5% to 50% happens incredibly fast,” he says. The world is about to enter this period of rapid transformation, he says. This change promises to upend the fossil fuel producers that fail to adapt at pace, and bring the rise of carbon emissions to an end. A growing number of energy experts agree. “Over the next decade we’ll see a far quicker than expected rollout of a number of clean energy technologies, which will almost certainly mean global emissions plateau,” Liebreich adds. The rollout is expected whether politicians increase their ambition or not, because the economics of clean energy are now too strong to ignore. Earlier this summer, BNEF reported that not only was renewable energy cheaper than building a new gas or coal plant, but it would soon be cheaper than using existing thermal plants too. This economic tipping point means it would save money to shut existing coal-fired power plants down and build new renewable energy projects from scratch. Abundant clean electricity could help remove the emissions from the world’s transport and heating systems too. By 2030, BNEF expects demand for road fuels to peak, while coal is expected to peak by 2026. DNV GL, a global energy advisory, believes that by the same year oil will no longer be the world’s biggest energy source, and by the end of the 2020s the world’s demand for crude will begin to fall. “It provides a lot of hope,” says Seb Henbest, the lead author of the BNEF report. “It provides a counterbalance to the doom and gloom we face, partly because it includes up-to-date data which tells a slightly different story.” It is a cautionary tale for fossil fuel companies that believe the world’s demand for polluting energy will continue to rise until the middle of the century. It is also a new narrative of hope, he says. “We’re a lot further on than we were. And yes, we need to go faster. And yes, it’s difficult and complicated. But at the same time we now live in a world where two-thirds of the global population live in a country where wind and solar power is the cheapest form of new electricity capacity. We have the tools to do this,” he says. Chris Stark, the head of the UK’s official climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, says the precedent set by the renewables industry proves that emerging technologies to capture carbon emissions can follow suit. “Even 10 years ago we were looking at a very different trajectory for global temperatures. We’ve moved on to a trajectory that today looks like 3C of warming [above pre-industrial levels], but prior to this we were on track for more than that; 4C, possibly even higher,” he says. The progress to date is not yet enough to meet global targets set in the Paris climate agreement, but a plateau in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 could play a major role in averting catastrophic global heating above 3C. It also proves that further ambition could bring the world closer to the sub-2C goal. “This change is a testament to new climate policies, and the work that has been done around the world. We need to do more of that,” he adds. The UK plans to lead the world’s future climate ambitions. Next year, Glasgow will host the UN’s 26th Conference of the Parties climate talks, known as COP26, to set out a roadmap that keeps rising temperatures well within 2C above pre-industrialised levels. Claire Perry MP, the president for COP26, says the climate talks are “where the rubber hits the road on the historic Paris agreement”. She adds that “expectations are rightly high” due to the “mounting public concern over climate change”, but the UK is ready to deliver on those expectations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/07/feed-in-tariffs-could-be-cut-back-from-high-take-up-of-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T03:22:49Z","webTitle":"Feed-in tariffs could be cut back due to high take-up of solar power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/07/feed-in-tariffs-could-be-cut-back-from-high-take-up-of-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/07/feed-in-tariffs-could-be-cut-back-from-high-take-up-of-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"Feed-in tariffs could be cut back due to high take-up of solar power","bodyText":"Governments should change the way feed-in tariffs are paid to homeowners or the high take-up of solar power might force them to be drastically cut back, one of Australia’s top energy experts says. On Tuesday the Clean Energy Regulator released new data which showed a record 3.5m solar panels were installed on Australia rooftops last year. The record 1,057 megawatts of capacity in small-scale systems installed across the country smashed the previous record set in 2012, and had the capacity to produce the equivalent output of a medium-sized coal-fired power station. It prompted a warning that the increase in supply to the grid could lead governments to cut feed-in tariffs because the power is “essentially worthless”. Tony Wood, the director of the Grattan Institute’s energy program, said high solar take-up could have the unintended consequence of over-supplying the grid during low demand periods. It would mean governments and retailers were subsidising solar energy that had no real value. “If it becomes that inefficient, it’s not beyond reckoning that governments would think, ‘well, hang on, why are we doing this,’” he said. “Obviously in the short term anyone benefiting from those subsidies doesn’t like it when it’s reduced or removed.” Wood thinks that means governments need to reform tariffs to make them more “cost effective”, as well as advocate for the roll-out of smart meters which can limit output during low-demand periods. But other energy experts say that the timeframe and scope of over-supply to the grid is so marginal that it isn’t a serious issue. Tristan Edis from Green Energy Markets said the rate of advance in storage capacity meant it was unlikely to ever be a problem. “You could foresee that we will reach a point if we kept the current rate of installations where, for example, on Christmas Day that a state like South Australia - which has very small base-load industry demand - five to 10 years down the track, you could end up with a situation where solar generation exceeded available demand,” he said. “But we’re talking one day of the year for a few hours in one state.” Edis said advances in battery technology as well as storage capacity projects such as the Snowy Hydro 2.0 scheme meant it was unlikely that solar supply would outstrip demand. “Right now the penetration of solar on a very good day in South Australia may reach 30% of total demand,” he said. “Over time that will creep higher and higher [but] we might be talking a 10 year timeframe. That’s enough time to expect batteries are going to achieve substantial cost declines such that they become an economically viable and sensible way of soaking up demand and generation during the day.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/aug/22/uk-must-reduce-personal-vehicle-ownership-meet-zero-carbon-target-mps-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-22T05:00:59Z","webTitle":"UK should cut vehicle use to hit zero-carbon target, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/22/uk-must-reduce-personal-vehicle-ownership-meet-zero-carbon-target-mps-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/aug/22/uk-must-reduce-personal-vehicle-ownership-meet-zero-carbon-target-mps-report","fields":{"headline":"UK should cut vehicle use to hit zero-carbon target, say MPs","bodyText":"The government should discourage personal vehicle use and reward energy-efficient homebuilding to meet its legally binding target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, MPs have said In a scathing parliamentary report, the cross-party science and technology select committee said recent Conservative governments have promised more but done less on the climate crisis, which has left several gaping policy holes that need to be filled. Among a list of 10 “clean growth” measures needed to make up lost ground, the MPs called for stamp duty incentives for energy-efficient homes, the ban on sales of petrol and diesel cars to be brought forward, a shift away from personal vehicles and greater use of technology to capture and store carbon. “Government action is needed to reverse the current policy trend of cutbacks and slow progress,” said the paper, which highlights the growing gulf between words and actions. This summer, the government claimed to be a global climate leader when it announced a long-term goal to go carbon neutral by the middle of the century. This followed parliament’s declaration of a climate emergency on 1 May. But the committee said such bold pledges in the past have been contradicted by backward steps: over the past 10 years, the government has cut subsidies for onshore wind, solar power and low-emission cars. It has frozen fuel duty, dropped plans for zero-carbon homes and eradicated feed-in tariffs for low-carbon power generation. Norman Lamb, a Liberal Democrat MP whose father founded the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, said: “Targets are of no value if you don’t design the incentives and framework to deliver them and deploy the technologies that are already there to achieve them.” Based on expert testimonies, the committee found most of the progress made so far by the UK was the result of the 2008 Climate Change Act, which was pushed through by the then climate and energy secretary, Ed Miliband, and enacted with cross-party support. Britain also benefited from adjustments at European level about how emissions are calculated. Most of that early momentum came from the electricity generation sector, as a shift from coal to gas and renewables accounted for 75% of the UK’s emissions cuts. The committee said the government must now put greater priority on heating and transport. The report said the ban on petrol and diesel car sales should be brought forward to 2035 or sooner, rather than the current goal of 2040 – and suggested even electric cars are not the answer because of the high emissions needed to make them. “In the long term, widespread personal vehicle ownership therefore does not appear to be compatible with significant decarbonisation. The government should not aim to achieve emissions reductions simply by replacing existing vehicles with lower-emissions versions,” it said. Lamb said other countries and even vehicle manufacturers have been more ambitious than the UK in phasing out petrol and diesel cars. The report also called for variable stamp duty pegged to the energy efficiency of homes. It proposed large-scale trials of heat pumps and hydrogen gas heating, more investment in carbon capture and storage technology, and a return of subsidies for onshore wind and solar power. Lamb will present the report to parliament after it reconvenes in September and the government will later be obliged to respond. “It’s a really interesting moment. We have a new prime minister. There is so much noise around Brexit, but this is the real challenge for Boris Johnson,” Lamb said. “There is nothing more serious than [the] climate. It will determine the future of our planet and communities. We have to act and make the case to the public to act.” Myles Allen, a professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford, said: “It’s all too easy to lose the big picture in complicated to-do lists. Stopping climate change is astonishingly simple: we need to stop dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. “So what the government really needs to do is get the CEOs of about 20 fossil fuel companies into a room and ask them to explain how they plan to make both their activities and the products they sell compliant with net-zero global carbon dioxide emissions by mid-century. “If any company cannot or will not answer the question, then we need to ask whether they should have a license to operate in the UK or a listing on the London Stock Exchange.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/feb/04/airlines-climate-crisis-plant-trees-carbon-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-04T12:57:23Z","webTitle":"Airlines want you to think they’re serious about the climate crisis.

They’re not","bodyText":"As environmentally conscious holidaymakers, inspired by Greta Thunberg’s Atlantic boat crossing, begin to book their no-fly Easter breaks, there are already signs that the aviation industry is feeling the pinch. In Sweden – home of the “flight shame” concept – there was an unprecedented 9% fall in domestic flights and a 4% drop overall in 2019. Today, in a bid to clean up their image, a coalition of airlines, airports and manufacturers called Sustainable Aviation has announced a 2050 net-zero carbon emissions pledge. In an effort to reach this target, the coalition is proposing that a third of the reduction in net emissions will come from carbon offsetting. This is the idea that emissions released from a flight can be balanced out by funding new renewable energy projects or planting trees. If it all sounds too good to be true, it is. Offsetting’s real power is to provide not a climate solution, but a social licence to continue with business as usual. In this case, it provides airlines with an excuse to plan for a 70% increase in passenger numbers. While offsetting may pay for things that have value in themselves (I’m all for planting trees, or installing solar power in the global south), it works against the essential imperative of the climate emergency: that emissions, and therefore the number of flights, must fall. The validity of offsetting rests on the claim that if we remove an amount of carbon from the atmosphere equivalent to that previously released, then the resulting change in atmospheric carbon is zero. But there’s no magic technology that can instantly draw carbon out of the atmosphere and then store it safely, securely and indefinitely. In the archetypal offsetting case, tree planting, the process takes decades (if it works at all – many trees never make it to maturity). The carbon initially released will trap heat over that extended period before it is reabsorbed – contributing to higher temperatures. A small rise in temperature can create positive feedback loops, leading to an event that creates an even bigger rise. In the Arctic, melting ice caps contain pockets of greenhouse gases. When the ice melts as a result of rising temperatures, these gases are released, causing even more warming. “Carbon neutral” never sounded so unappealing. Time matters, and we have very little of it left. Those dressing up a process that (at best) aims to remove, years from now, carbon emitted today as a climate solution either don’t understand the science, or don’t want you to. Even if we did have magic carbon capture technology, offsetting would still rest on a key deceit – that we can trade one essential action to tackle climate change for another. The spectacularly grave nature of the climate emergency means that we must both rapidly cut carbon emissions and rapidly increase carbon drawdown. Yet offsetting cunningly offers us a pass on the former if we chuck cash at the latter. Real solutions are available, even if you won’t find them in the airline chiefs’ pitch. First, we could replace air passenger duty with a policy that targets frequent fliers. Fifteen per cent of the UK’s population accounts for 70% of all flights (and half the country doesn’t fly at all in a given year). We could allow everyone a single tax-free flight a year, before taxing subsequent flights at a rising rate. This could reduce demand for flying without penalising the annual family holiday in the sun – instead making it very expensive to fly out for the weekend to the second home in Tuscany for the sixth time that year. The government’s recent promise to FlyBe to review air passenger duty should have been the trigger to adopt this. Second, you could lobby your employer to sign up to Climate Perks – a scheme that offers employees two paid “journey days” each year (in addition to annual leave) only if they choose to swap the plane for the train for holiday travel. More than 40 employers have signed up since its autumn launch – giving staff time to experiment with overland (or sea) travel, and take advantage of a renaissance in long-distance and overnight train travel in Europe. Finally, what of those flights that truly can’t be avoided? Perhaps a good faith approach for the industry would be to offer a “climate damages” scheme to passengers. Instead of pretending the damage done by carbon emissions can be neutralised, it could instead transfer funds to communities suffering climate impacts – predominantly in the global south – precisely in recognition of their now-increased vulnerability. This wouldn’t be unproblematic, but it would force to the surface a basic truth: carbon equals consequences.

Narrow roads provided the perfect environment for them, so “they [didn’t] feel like they are in a foreign land”, says tour operator Everest Kayondo. But not any more. The park’s lush forest is being uprooted and red trucks and yellow diggers stand ready to pave the road – and the way for new energy projects. “We used to see animals like baboons, buffaloes and even giraffes along this road, but we’ve lost them now,” says Kayondo, chairperson of the Association of Uganda Tour Operators (Auto), which represents more than 250 tourism businesses in Uganda. The park, Uganda’s largest and most visited, is home to two waterfalls – Murchison Falls, one of the most powerful waterfalls in the world, and Uhuru (meaning freedom in Swahili) Falls, which was created by floods in 1962, the year of Uganda’s independence from British colonial rule. The area is on Unesco’s list of wetlands of international importance. But last June, Bonang Power and Energy, a South African company, announced it had applied for a licence to build a 360MW hydro plant at Uhuru Falls – which is adjacent to Murchison Falls. It was a further blow to conservationists, already reeling from news that energy company Total E&amp;P Uganda had been given approval to develop six oilfields in the park, to the north of Lake Albert. Despite government assurances that the dam would not go ahead, last month the then minister of energy and mineral development, Irene Muloni, backtracked, saying the cabinet had ordered a feasibility study “in order to make a scientifically informed decision” on the impact of the proposal. The government has ambitions to boost the country’s electricity supply over the next 20 years. It says that in order for Uganda to achieve the “desired socioeconomic transformation”, it wants to increase access to the national grid from 26% to 80%. A statement added that demand for power was growing at about 10% per year, demanding the development of renewable energy sources, including hydropower, “one of the cheapest forms of renewable energy”. Last year the Isimba hydropower plant, 4km downstream of Simba Falls on the Nile, was commissioned, and the Karuma plant, also along the Nile, is expected to be commissioned this year. News of the proposed Uhuru dam has led to an outcry from the tourism industry, environmental groups and the public. A Change.org petition supporting the #savemurchisonfalls social media campaign has received more than 21,000 signatures. “The government is telling us that once they construct a dam on Uhuru Falls, Murchison Falls will not be affected,” says Benedict Ntale, a tour operator and vice-chairman of Auto. “But given the short distance between the two falls, touching either will affect the other. The source of water is the same.” Ntale added that building a dam at Uhuru made little sense because it is a seasonal waterfall, which is mostly dry outside of the rainy seasons. The energy ministry declined the Guardian’s request for further comment on the dam proposals. Standing in front of the picture-postcard backdrop of the falls, Akello Harriet Hope, from Climate Action Uganda, says she is concerned about the damage a dam would do to the surrounding ecosystem. “We’re asking the government to invest in other forms of energy like biogas and solar power instead,” she says. Activists hope to persuade the government to halt the project for economic as well as environmental reasons – tourism is Uganda’s leading export earner. “At least a third of tourists who come to Uganda visit Murchison, and the entire value chain of tourism gets something to take home – drivers, hoteliers, craftmakers,” says Kayondo. He says that road construction close to the falls – which is on the other side of the park from the oil project – suggest that the decision to build the dam has already been made, irrespective of the feasibility study. “If these roads are purely for oil, why is there that section which branches up to the top of the falls?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/aug/16/cost-of-living-crisis-covid-vaccine-conservative-leadership-liz-truss-rishi-sunak","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T20:41:33Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss faces Rishi Sunak in leadership hustings after comments about British workers leaked – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/aug/16/cost-of-living-crisis-covid-vaccine-conservative-leadership-liz-truss-rishi-sunak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/aug/16/cost-of-living-crisis-covid-vaccine-conservative-leadership-liz-truss-rishi-sunak","fields":{"headline":"Liz Truss faces Rishi Sunak in leadership hustings after comments about British workers leaked – as it happened","bodyText":"This blog will close shortly. Thank you for reading. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have ruled out freezing energy prices by claiming it would be an expensive, short-term fix that would fail to solve the underlying problem with soaring energy costs. The Conservative leadership contenders were questioned on whether they would back Labour’s new strategy to fix the domestic energy cap during a leadership hustings in Perth on Tuesday night. Truss, the favourite to win the contest, won applause when she said the best strategy to combat rising prices would be to lift the green levy on bills, greatly increase the UK’s gas production in the North Sea and to reverse the recent rise in national insurance rates. Questioned on whether she should heed a poll in the Times showing two thirds of Tory voters backed Labour’s plans, she said: “What I worry about is putting a sticking plaster on this to say we will find the money but be in the same situation in six months’ time.” The problem will not go away by then, she said, because Vladimir Putin was unlikely to be defeated in Ukraine that soon. “What’s not right is throwing money at the problem without dealing with the root cause,” she added. Sunak said it was far more prudent to target help at pensioners and those on the lowest incomes. “What I will not do is follow policies that risk increasing inflation – especially if it amounts to borrowing £50bn – and put it on the country’s credit card. That’s not right, it’s not responsible and it’s certainly not Conservative,” he said. Read the full round-up of tonight’s hustings below. The Tories like to portray themselves as being on the side of hard-working British people. It’s safe territory not just among the party membership but also – crucially – key to holding together their fragile post-2019 electoral coalition of the former Labour heartlands and the true blue south. So it would be a reckless aspiring Tory leader who offers even glancing criticism of the great British worker. But Liz Truss’s extraordinary comments when she was No 2 at the Treasury appear to do just that. It is no secret that London and the south-east have the highest productivity of any UK region by some way, according to official statistics. But you’d be hard pressed to find any economist who believes this is down to the “mindset” of workers in other parts of the country. In reality, the plethora of big international businesses in the capital, booming financial and services industries, huge R&amp;D spend and the best transport infrastructure in Britain are the principal reasons. The fact that too many other parts of the country don’t have these in-built advantages was exactly what the government’s levelling up promises were supposed to address. Truss is asked if she can be trusted on tax cuts. Unsurprisingly she says: “The answer is yes.” This leadership race is really going round and round in circles, isn’t it? Anyway, we push on. It’s the final question. Truss is asked if she will seek to unite the party by inviting Rishi Sunak and some of his supporters to join her cabinet in leading positions. She says it is important to unite the Tories to beat Nicola Sturgeon and Keir Starmer. She says she will appoint a cabinet from across the party, including Sunak, if she becomes PM. So, just like that (after two hours), the hustings is over. And if you just can’t wait for more, they’ll be doing it all over again in Northern Ireland on Wednesday. A member of the audience asks if Truss would consider reinstating the 0.7% of GDP spent on overseas aid. This receives an incredibly lukewarm applause from the Tories in the room, with a few audibly irritated murmurs thrown in. She says: The answer is at present it is not economically affordable. I will see what the position is and … when we can do it, we will do it. We are committed to that under legislation. She adds that, as foreign secretary, she has ensured money is being spent on humanitarian aid in places such as Ukraine and the Horn of Africa to ensure the money is going to those “who most need it”. We move on to questions from the Conservative members in the room. Truss is asked what the pension increase will be, with the man asking the question citing that Sunak backed down from an 8% increase. He asks if she will “just fudge the figures again”? She says she is fully committed to the triple lock and the highest rate. Mackay says the Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, said Boris Johnson misled parliament over Partygate. Does Truss agree? She replies: I don’t agree that Boris Johnson misled parliament. He did a great job as prime minister. He delivered Brexit, the election result, the vaccines. He’s the only world leader with a street named after him in Kyiv. Mackay says Johnson is also the only prime minister to have received a fixed penalty notice for breaking Covid rules, to which Truss says: “I think he was the only prime minister that’s actually been prime minister during Covid”. Things are getting silly now as the crowd continues to bray at Mackay for daring to mention Johnson’s law-breaking. Truss adds: He’s leaving the job. What’s done is done. She adds that she thinks Johnson is “entitled to go on holiday” when asked if the country has been left without a prime minister. Truss says she would not allow another Scottish independence referendum, saying it was a “once-in-a-generation” question for the electorate. Mackay pushes back by saying that, since 2014, there has been Brexit and Covid. “What has Covid got to do with it? That is a nonsense argument,” Truss exclaims, as her supporters boo and heckle the host. An STV viewer’s question is put to Truss: if she can change her mind on Brexit, why can’t the people of Scotland change their mind on independence? Truss says: I respected the democratic will of the people when they voted to leave the EU. I was somebody before the vote took place who was undecided and was worried about the disruption. Disruption didn’t take place and I straight away got on with delivering the opportunities of Brexit, whether it was trade deals or getting things done differently on sanctions. Truss is now being asked about the Guardian’s exclusive story this evening that she was heard in leaked audio saying UK workers need “more graft”. She denies knowledge of the specific quote but says: What we need in this country is more productivity across the country and we need more economic growth. The thing that we don’t have enough of is capital investment. Liz Truss is told by Mackay that three-quarters of Tory supporters back Labour’s plans on energy costs and asked is she is being left behind on the issue. She immediately says taxes must be cut “because it is important people are able to keep hold of their own money”. She says it would be wrong to take money from people in taxes “and then give it back to them in benefits”. Reversing the national insurance increase and temporary moratorium on the green energy levy would be her first steps, she adds. An STV viewer has asked how Truss’s tax cuts will help low income families below the tax threshold. “They will help everybody because a growing economy means jobs, more opportunities and more growth,” she says. The issue of trust is back on the agenda as Sunak is asked what he will do to to rebuild it. He says he will restore the independent adviser on ministerial standards and ethics, he will be honest with people and won’t sell “false promises” and make sure the government is run “with integrity at the heart”. Asked if he feels it hasn’t been run with integrity, Sunak says “that is why I resigned from government, yes.” Sunak is now answering a question about investigating where money from Westminster goes once it is set aside for spending in Scotland. He says: We found out where it is going, you know where it is going? The welfare budget in Scotland is increasing by 50% over the next five years, right, that is wrong, right, and we have to make that argument. We are the party that believes in people working hard. That is the end of Sunak’s Q&amp;A and Liz Truss is now making her way back on stage. Sunak is asked if he will rethink the government’s plan to send illegal immigrants to Rwanda. The person asking the question describes it as “inhuman, inhumane” (Sunak visibly laughs. Hmm…) and urges him to work with the French to tackle to issue. He says that “with the greatest of respect, I disagree with you” to a smattering of applause. He adds: I stand here as a representation of our country’s unbelievable compassion in welcoming people to our shores … we have always done that and we will continue to be that beacon of hope for people around the world but it must be done fairly, it must be done legally and making the Rwanda policy work is an important part of getting a grip of this situation. He adds that the ECHR definition of asylum is “too broad”. Mackay now asks if he still thinks he has a chance of winning the Tory leadership election. Sunak says he is out there fighting and is “going to give it everything I’ve got until the last day of this contest”. Now, we move on to question from the Tory members in the room. Sunak is asked how he will combat the perception of the Conservative party. He says: By definition, [swing voters] are not ideological. They’re not naturally Tories, they’re not naturally Labour people. What they want, above anything else, is a government that works … a government that is conducted seriously, competently … and with decency and integrity at the heart of everything that it does. That is the change I’m going to bring and that is how we will appeal to everyone. An STV viewer question is now being asked of Sunak. Would he be willing to live in social housing on minimum wage for a week to help him relate to the average Brit? He says: I know things are difficult right now for many people, the most important thing right now is to help them with their energy bills and I’ve got a plan to do that and particularly focus on the most vulnerable. That’s what I did as chancellor. Asked if he would ever allow another independence referendum, Sunak it would be “barmy” to focus on a constitutional question when people are worrying about hearing their homes. He adds that Scottish people want to see the Scottish government working together with the UK government. Sunak says the cost of living crisis is the “most important issue facing all of us” but says he will not support Labour and ScottishPower’s call for an energy price cap freeze. He says he would cut VAT off energy bills for everyone and provide extra help for people on low incomes and pensioners. “Through no fault of their own because we are at war with Russia with sanctions … it is right the government support those who need help,” he says. Sunak reiterates that he rules out a freeze. He says the most important way to support small businesses is tax cuts, such as the employment allowance. Mackay is now asking Sunak about his comments that NHS spending is “fine”. He asks how much of a pay rise he would give nurses. Sunak says: I would listen to the review of the independent body. He refuses to answer if he thinks nurses are worth more than a 5% pay rise and instead says he wants to tackle to issue of missed appointments. “I want to get tough on that,” he says. Liz Truss says she is free to say “a woman is a woman”, which receives an extended applause from the members in the audience. She goes on to say she “gets things done” and “pushes things through”. “I will deliver for Scotland and I will deliver for the United Kingdom,” she says. Under her leadership, the Tories will defeat the SNP and Labour in a general election in 2024, according to Truss. She says the union will go “from strength to strength to strength”. And now the hustings truly gets under way, with Sunak facing questions from Mackay on the cost of living crisis. Now Sunak’s leadership rival and the runaway bookies’ favourite Liz Truss is on stage and starts by telling Scottish members that she considers herself “to be a child of the union”. She says: We are not just neighbours, we are family and I will never, ever let our family be split up. Truss goes on to say “the people of Scotland deserve better and want better. What they want is opportunities … in short, they want an aspiration nation and that is what I will seek to deliver as your prime minister.” She adds: We need to do things differently. We can’t just have business as usual. I have a plan for growth for all of the United Kingdom. Now she is reeling off her classics, including getting more trade deals to benefit the salmon and whisky industry, getting EU laws “off the statute books” and reversing the national insurance rise. Truss did seem to receive a rather more enthusiastic welcome from the audience as she walked on stage, it must be said. Sunak says he will end the “devolve and forget” mentality, saying he will call out the SNP on their record on issues such as drug and alcohol abuse. He swiftly moves on to say – very loudly – that he will take on the “lefty-woke culture that wants to cancel our history, our values and our women”. That receives a rapturous applause from the members in Perth. He says he has a plan to fix the problem with illegal immigration. Under his plan, the UK “will take back control of our borders”, he claims. As a side note, Sunak hasn’t stood still since walking out on stage and is continuously moving backwards and forwards. Rishi Sunak is introduced on stage by one of his supporters Andrew Bowie, the MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, who says the former chancellor “has already demonstrated through his actions that he has what it takes and, crucially, that he is a unionist”. Sunak starts by telling the story of his family being welcomed to the UK 60 years ago and “building a better life”. He is reeling off the classics. He delivered prescriptions for his mum, who was a chemist, and also did her books. He says: The best way that we transform people’s lives is by ensuring that the birthright of every child is a world-class education. That, my friends, when you look at what has happened here is a lesson that the SNP government would do well to remember. The former chancellor says “we must restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite our country”, adding that to restore trust, he tells people the things “they need to hear, not what they want to hear”. And we’re off. The chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, Craig Hoy MSP, is welcoming the party’s members to tonight’s hustings and urges them them to get behind the new leader, whoever the winner is, to defeat the SNP and Labour. The leader of the Scottish Tories, Douglas Ross, is introduced on stage and starts by saying the next leader “must govern for the whole of the UK and work to build support in all nations of the UK”. He adds: Fortunately for us, both Liz and Rishi are up to the challenges ahead. They have shown they have the dedication and ambition to take our party forward. Now STV’s political editor, Colin Mackay, is on stage and I think – I hope, at least – we are about to get the hustings under way. Tonight’s Tory leadership hustings are about to get under way in Perth, Scotland. You can follow along on the live stream above or, alternatively, I’ll be posting updates throughout the event. At the moment though, both seats on the stage remain empty as we count down to kick-off and Bon Jovi’s It’s My Life is reverberating around the room. The suspense is killing me. It seems not everyone is delighted the Conservative leadership hustings is taking place in Scotland tonight. The Guardian’s Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, has been out and about in Perth, capturing images of some of the protests being held outside the venue. Among the banners are flags in support of Scottish independence. Looking ahead to tonight’s Tory leadership hustings in Perth, Scotland, and Liz Truss has said she will “fly the flag for the UK not just as prime minister but as mMinister for the Union”. The front runner to become prime minister on 5 September had been criticised for saying she would “ignore” the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. However, she now appears keen to promote her unionist credentials ahead of the event, which is due to start in just under half an hour. In a press release issued to the media, she said: Scotland has gone from strength to strength at the heart of our family of nations, leading the world with great thinkers, makers and innovators. I will never let anyone talk down its potential. At this juncture, we cannot stick with the status quo which has resulted in sluggish economic growth, the highest tax burden in 70 years and Scotland being the most heavily taxed part of the UK. I stand ready to deliver as prime minister a clear plan in line with Conservative values to get the Scottish economy moving. This is what clear Conservative leadership can offer: a relentless focus on delivering for the Scottish people and everyone else across our country. That is why I will fly the flag for the UK not just as prime minister but as minister for the union. I will empower the Scottish parliament with parliamentary privilege to allow for tougher questioning of ministers, sharpening the teeth of MSPs as watchdogs of Nicola Sturgeon’s administration. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Tory leadership front runner Liz Truss is “peddling offensive nonsense” following the leaked audio of her saying British workers need more “graft”. He said: With wages shrinking thanks to Tory failure to bring inflation under control and years of lacklustre growth, it’s grossly offensive for Liz Truss to effectively brand British workers lazy. I would have hoped she had moved on from the days of her Britannia Unchained fiasco, but it seems that is the blueprint for her prospective government. Workers across the country are working all hours to keep a roof over their heads, put food on the table and provide for their families. Liz Truss should be helping working people to cope with this cost of living crises, as Labour this week outlined we would do, not peddling this offensive nonsense. Liz Truss, now the Tory leadership frontrunner, launched an astonishing broadside against British workers, saying they needed “more graft” and suggesting they lacked the “skill and application” of foreign rivals, the Guardian can reveal. In a leaked recording, the then No 2 at the Treasury also risked pitting Londoners against the rest of the country by attempting to explain the difference between the capital and other regions in the UK. Truss, who has put patriotism at the heart of her leadership campaign, suggested the disparity was “partly a mindset or attitude thing”. The comments were made when Truss was the chief secretary to the Treasury, a post she held until 2019. In the recording she intimated that there seemed little desire to change the working culture so that the UK could become more prosperous. The highly disparaging remarks echo a controversial passage about British workers being among the “worst idlers in the world”, from the book Britannia Unchained which she co-authored in 2012 when she was a new backbench MP seeking to make her mark as a neo-Thatcherite. Rishi Sunak has said he would “take on” the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, rather than ignore her, if he becomes the next prime minister. Asked in an interview with the BBC if he would ignore the SNP leader, Sunak said: No, I don’t want to ignore Nicola Sturgeon, I want to take her on and beat her. I think we can make a very strong case for what the UK government does to help people in Scotland and as chancellor I started that. Sunak’s comments come after his rival, Liz Truss, claimed she would ignore Sturgeon if she wins the Tory leadership contest, and branded the first minister an “attention seeker”, PA Media reported. A Foreign Office official raised concerns about plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, citing state surveillance, arbitrary detention, torture and killings by the country’s government, the high court has heard. The court has been asked to consider an application by the foreign secretary to keep parts of certain government documents secret for fear the contents could damage international relations and threaten national security. The government’s application for a public interest immunity (PII) certificate asks to keep 10 short passages confidential. The Guardian, the BBC and the Times made submissions to the court urging disclosure of these 10 passages, arguing that this was in the public interest. A draft ruling from Lord Justice Lewis into the PII application is expected tomorrow. We’ll have live coverage of tonight’s Tory leadership hustings from Scotland coming up later on. However, with the Northern Ireland hustings event due to take place on Wednesday, both candidates have already been challenged to set out their positions on the Northern Ireland protocol. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are due in Belfast later this week and will address party members who will cast their votes this month, with the result set to be announced on 5 September. Ahead of the event, the Ulster Unionist party leader, Doug Beattie, described the hustings as “an opportune moment for both candidates to set out their stall on exactly how they are going to proceed in the weeks ahead to deal with the protocol”. He said: The protocol has only played a small part of the policy discussions so far, but it will be one of the most important issues for an incoming prime minister because its impact is so far reaching in Northern Ireland, and the United Kingdom’s future relations with our neighbours. Neither can the EU be allowed to prevaricate any longer. Northern Ireland cannot afford to have more months of endless diplomatic whataboutery. Both the EU and the UK government need to get back to the negotiating table as a matter of urgency. If they don’t then we would expect the UK government to act. The protocol needs dealt with once and for all because it continues to damage the Belfast agreement and places a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.

Follow me on Twitter @tomambrose89. Here’s a roundup of the key developments from today: More than two-thirds of Conservative voters say the government should temporarily renationalise energy companies if they cannot offer lower bills. The surge in public support for freezing prices will put pressure on the Conservative candidates ahead of a hustings on Tuesday night. Liz Truss has suggested she favours help for only the most vulnerable households – as well as tax cuts in the autumn. Senior Scottish Conservatives fear Liz Truss’s “red meat” attacks on Nicola Sturgeon as an attention-seeker will alienate moderate voters, as the leadership hopeful prepares to face Rishi Sunak in Perth. Both candidates will be challenged on the escalating cost of living crisis and soaring energy bills, and the absence of urgent action from the UK government. But a third question is likely to dominate this event: whether Truss was right earlier in the campaign to dismiss Scotland’s first minister by saying she should be “ignored”. Keir Starmer defended the costs of his plan to freeze energy bills this winter after some economists said it could cost as much as furlough. The Labour leader said during a visit to the Nationwide building society headquarters in Swindon: “Our scheme is fully funded. Our scheme actually depends on a windfall tax on the oil and gas companies to maintain that price freeze.” Liz Truss has said her priority remains reducing taxes, responding to Labour’s call for an extension of the windfall levy. Speaking in Scotland, the Tory leadership frontrunner said it was wrong to focus on “sticking plasters”. The real value of UK workers’ pay continued to fall at the fastest rate for 20 years in June as wage increases were outstripped by soaring inflation amid the cost of living crisis. The Office for National Statistics said annual growth in average pay, excluding bonuses, strengthened to 4.7% in the three months to June against a backdrop of low unemployment and high job vacancies. Two-thirds of the public thinks the government is not doing enough to help with the cost of living, a new poll has found. The survey by Ipsos found that 66% of people think the government is not providing enough help as rising energy bills surge back into the headlines, while only 28% think current measures are about right or too much, PA News reports. A leading group representing green-minded Conservatives has called for the new prime minister to take urgent action to insulate more homes and scale up the installation of heat pumps to help poorer households with energy bills. The Conservative Environment Network’s intervention marks the latest stage in a fightback by environmental Tories amid signs the race to replace Boris Johnson could lead to green measures being rolled back, and greater weight given to the voices of MPs opposed to such policies. The government is concerned about how the cost of living crisis will affect people’s health and has taken it into consideration when planning the rollout of flu and Covid booster jabs, a minister said. The public health and vaccines minister, Maggie Throup, said: “I think if people are reassured about their own health, then it helps to take the pressure off some of the other concerns that they may have.” Labour is planning a campaigning blitz in order to take ownership of its new energy price cap policy in case the next Tory leader bows to pressure and cancels the 80% rise expected in October. Keir Starmer has vowed that his party “wouldn’t let people pay a penny more” on their gas and electricity bills this winter. Momentum and trade unions are set to force a vote on strikes and pay increases at the Labour conference, with motions designed to contradict Keir Starmer’s stance. The campaign to win support for the motion will be launched this week by the former shadow minister Sam Tarry, who was sacked for joining a picket line and contradicting Labour policy on pay in broadcast interviews. I’m handing over to my colleague now. Thanks so much for joining me. I’ll back again in the morning. Momentum and trade unions are set to force a vote on strikes and pay increases at the Labour conference, with motions designed to contradict Keir Starmer’s stance. The campaign to win support for the motion will be launched this week by the former shadow minister Sam Tarry, who was sacked for joining a picket line and contradicting Labour policy on pay in broadcast interviews. Momentum will launch its campaign on Thursday with Tarry and fellow Labour MPs Dawn Butler and Jon Trickett, as well as Andrea Egan, the president of the trade union Unison. The motion will echo Tarry’s backing for workers demanding pay increases in line with inflation – the line Labour sources said had contradicted Labour policy. Tarry said Labour should take the opportunity at conference to show solidarity with striking workers. “Labour has a huge chance to show it’s on the side of working people,” he said. “But by firing shadow ministers like myself for standing on picket lines, Keir Starmer is in danger of driving a wedge between Labour and the millions of working people desperate for real relief in this escalating cost of living crisis. I am proud of our party’s historic links to the trade unions – it’s time all of our party were.” Starmer has told his frontbenchers that the party should not join picket lines and instead should focus on calling out the government to end the disputes. This week, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, reiterated the party’s position, which has come under fire from its own MPs. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, caused a rift in the shadow cabinet when she joined striking members of the Communication Workers Union in her constituency. The stance is likely to come under further pressure this week with another series of transport strikes by the RMT on rail and underground networks.

The lengthy contest to succeed Boris Johnson as the UK Conservative leader and next prime minister enters its final phase on Tuesday evening with the only party hustings in Scotland; the Tories chose Perth, a city once seen as a Tory stronghold. Both candidates will be challenged on the escalating cost of living crisis and soaring energy bills, and the absence of urgent action from the UK government. But a third question is likely to dominate this event: whether Truss was right earlier in the campaign to dismiss Scotland’s first minister by saying she should be “ignored”. Senior figures in both camps agree it was a misstep. It suggested Truss, the clear favourite to win, had adopted a “muscular unionism” approach to Sturgeon’s nationalist government. It undermined a subtler strategy devised by Michael Gove to promote the union quietly, by putting UK government money into roads, community projects and infrastructure, sidestepping the devolved Scottish government by working directly with councils. A Sunak ally said Truss’s remarks, and her disastrous suggestion that public sector pay rates could be cut in northern regions, alienated Tory councillors in his constituency, who had switched support from Truss to the former chancellor. More seriously, he said, her remarks in Exeter showed a “deep misunderstanding” of the need to persuade moderate unionists and uncommitted yes voters to support the union in a future referendum. He said: She’s probably going to win this [so] why did she pander to that extreme position when it’s going to create further difficulties for her down the line? Just say: ‘I need to be a stateswoman’ instead of throwing red meat to the ultras. Truss supporters in Scotland acknowledge they have advised her to adopt a less belligerent tone against Sturgeon: they insist Truss will follow Gove’s softly-softly strategy. One ally said: To me it was just a throwaway line at a hustings for a party audience. I don’t believe we will see a major shift in approach to Scotland. The emphasis will be on raising the profile of the UK government and on direct investment, which I think is very clever politics. Read more here: The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, will continue deploying the Royal Navy to tackle people making crossings of the English Channel in small boats if she becomes the next prime minister. PA reports: The Tory leadership frontrunner said she would “absolutely” maintain the military presence following suggestions the scheme introduced by Boris Johnson could end. Introduced in April as the prime minister came under pressure to stem migrant crossings, the scheme is due to be reviewed in January. But Truss said the Navy would “absolutely” continue to play a role when asked by reporters in Scotland ahead of the latest hustings in the Tory leadership race. It came after The Telegraph reported that the navy was planning to end its role in the scheme. Defence secretary Ben Wallace denied this was a “new announcement”, pointing to a previous government statement saying the naval presence had been agreed until 31 January. Rachel Hall here taking over from Nicola Slawson – do get in touch with anything we’ve missed by emailing me. Here’s a summary of the key developments of the day so far: More than two-thirds of Conservative voters say the government should temporarily renationalise energy companies if they cannot offer lower bills. The surge in public support for freezing prices will put pressure on the Conservative candidates ahead of a hustings on Tuesday night. Liz Truss has suggested she favours help for only the most vulnerable households – as well as tax cuts in the autumn.

Keir Starmer has vowed that his party “wouldn’t let people pay a penny more” on their gas and electricity bills this winter. A leading group representing green-minded Conservatives has called for the new prime minister to take urgent action to insulate more homes and scale up the installation of heat pumps to help poorer households with energy bills. The Conservative Environment Network (CEN), which has the support of 133 Tory MPs, half the backbench parliamentary party, said its plan could be rolled out in parallel with measures to directly help with this winter’s fuel costs and would help move the UK towards its net zero goals, as well as saving people money. The CEN’s intervention marks the latest stage in a fightback by environmental Tories amid signs the race to replace Boris Johnson could lead to green measures being rolled back, and greater weight given to the voices of MPs opposed to such policies. Liz Truss, the clear favourite to become the next prime minister, has criticised the installation of solar farms on formerly agricultural land, and says she supports efforts to extract shale gas by fracking in areas where it has local support. Her rival in the contest, Rishi Sunak, has pledged to tighten a de facto ban on planning permission for new onshore wind schemes. The push against green measures has been led by Tory MPs and peers from the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, a relatively new body that argues against many environmental policies on the basis of the cost of living and energy security. Read the full story here: Liz Truss has said her priority remains reducing taxes, responding to Labour’s call for an extension of the windfall levy. Keir Starmer has said his party would freeze the energy price cap at its current level of 1,971 for six months from October, paid for in part by an extension of the windfall levy on the profits of the oil and gas companies. Speaking in Scotland, the Tory leadership frontrunner said it was wrong to focus on “sticking plasters”. She said: We’re still in the leadership contest at the moment. Now, my priority is reducing taxes so people can keep more of their own money at the same time as making sure we boost energy supply. It is wrong to just keep sticking plasters on this problem. What we actually need to do is make sure we are unleashing more energy, for example, from the North Sea. We’re investing in technologies like nuclear, and we’re finding more renewable energy as well. Meanwhile, more than two-thirds of Conservative voters say that the government should temporarily renationalise energy companies if they cannot offer lower bills. The poll, released by the campaigning organisation 38 Degrees, also shows overwhelming support for Labour’s policy to freeze the price cap this year, keeping it at its current rate of £1,971. The Opinium poll found 86% of the public and 85% of current Conservative voters back keeping the price cap. The surge in public support for freezing prices will put pressure on the Conservative candidates ahead of a hustings on Tuesday night. Two-thirds of the public thinks the government is not doing enough to help with the cost of living, a new poll has found. The survey by Ipsos found that 66% of people think the government is not providing enough help as rising energy bills surge back into the headlines, while only 28% think current measures are about right or too much, PA News reports. These figures represent a worsening of the government’s position in the eyes of the public since it last announced measures to help households weather the cost-of-living crisis in late May. Following that announcement, the proportion of the public saying the government was not doing enough fell from 76% to 49%. But a deteriorating economic picture now appears to have reversed that trend, as forecasts from the Bank of England suggest inflation will peak higher and later, while energy bills are set to exceed 4,000 next year. Trinh Tu, managing director of public affairs at Ipsos, said: As the cost of living continues to rise, it will come as no surprise to see high levels of the public saying the government is not providing enough support. But, she added, it is “notable” that levels of dissatisfaction with the government are rising even among Conservative voters, 55% of whom now say not enough support is being offered. Boris Johnson himself admitted this month that current support measures are insufficient, but has ruled out taking further action before his successor as prime minister is announced on 5 September. The poll of 2,000 British adults was carried out between 9 and 11 August, before Labour announced its policy of freezing energy bills for six months on Monday. Even so, the survey found the opposition had already started extending its lead over the Conservatives on managing the budget and cutting the cost of living. The poll found that 44% trusted Labour to manage Britain’s taxes and spending, up from 35% in July and a seven-point lead over the Conservatives. On cutting the cost of living, 45% trusted Labour while only 30% trusted the Conservatives - more than doubling the gap between the two parties reported in July. Tu added: The Labour party are now pulling ahead as the party most trusted to reduce the cost of living and manage Britain’s taxes and public spending, but still only by a minority, highlighting Keir Starmer’s own challenges as he finally sets out Labour’s plans to relieve cost-of-living pressures. Keir Starmer was visiting the Nationwide Building Society headquarters in Swindon accompanied by former MP Heidi Alexander, who is the party’s candidate in Swindon South at the next general election. Both Swindon South and Swindon North returned Labour MPs during the Blair and Brown years but since 2010 have been represented by the Conservatives, PA News reports. The Labour leader was asked what his party needed to do to win in towns and cities like Swindon if he was to become prime minister. He said: I’m here in Swindon, and not for the first time, because it’s very important to me. I was very concerned about the Honda job losses that took place not so long ago and spoke to many of the employees at the time who were very worried about what will happen to them. I think that what we offer is rebooting the economy, growing places like Swindon. There are jobs to be had if you have government backing local schemes to build those jobs, rebuild our public services, and crucially uniting our communities so we can all fight this and face this together. Keir Starmer said the biggest cause of division in Scotland was the Conservative party. The Labour leader said: The single biggest driver of division in Scotland is the Tory party in Westminster. I want to hold our UK together, I want to make a positive case for the UK as we go forward. The problem with the Tories is that they’re part of the problem because so many people of Scotland do not want to be associated with a Tory government back in Westminster. Conservative leadership hopefuls Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are visiting Scotland ahead of a members’ hustings in Perth on Tuesday night. Keir Starmer disagreed with the assumption that only the poorest will be struggling with the rising cost of living and said his universal plan would also reduce inflation. The Labour leader: I think that this assumption that most people can afford these massive hikes in their energy bills is completely wrong. I think the government in making that argument is completely out of touch. Here at the Nationwide in Swindon the staff have been telling me about the number of people coming through the door from all sorts of backgrounds who are really worried. I’m not surprised because an average energy price hike from £2,000 to £3,500 or £4,200 is huge. I challenge the assumption that it’s only those who are particularly hard-up that are going to struggle this winter. I think many, many people are going to struggle this winter and that’s why it’s very important we have a scheme that is universal. The other advantage of our scheme is that it drives inflation down by 4% and so it answers the question of what would you do about energy prices this winter but also how will you drive down inflation. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, has written for the Guardian about the cost of living crisis. He writes that while the Conservatives support oil and gas giants, the current crisis could drag half of UK households into fuel poverty. The cost of living emergency facing the British people is not an inevitable, unalterable fact of life. We are told so often by government ministers that the pain and anguish the British people are facing is something we have to get used to, and all we can do is tinker round the edges. This energy bill crisis will devastate millions of families and could force more than half of British households into fuel poverty. Unlike the Conservatives, Labour is not willing to stand by and allow that social catastrophe to happen. This is why Labour has proposed to freeze energy prices. It’s important we understand the deeper lessons this moment teaches us. First, while some of the causes of this cost of living crisis are driven by global factors, its effects – who suffers, who pays and who government protects – are not predetermined. It is a deeply political decision: the Conservatives have opted to let families and businesses pay unsustainably high energy bills while oil and gas companies enjoy huge and unexpected profits. The second lesson is that affordable energy should be a right for people across our society, and government must ensure that right. Whether a service is provided publicly or privately, there are duties of government that cannot be ducked. David Cameron accused me of “living in a Marxist universe” when I proposed applying a cap to energy bills as Labour leader. He was dead wrong. Markets need rules to prevent exploitation. Governments must be willing to intervene when there is a profound risk to people’s economic security. Beyond this crisis, we need to bring fundamental reform to our failing energy system, which is currently delivering neither affordability nor security for our country. Third, we must draw the right long-term conclusions about energy policy. This is not, as some would claim, the first net-zero crisis. It is just the latest fossil-fuel crisis. Our job should be to ensure that it is the last. The undeniable truth is that while we remain dependent on fossil fuels, we are vulnerable to the geopolitics of energy. Petrostates, dictators and politicians such as Vladimir Putin are using energy as a weapon of war. Gas prices currently stand at four times the price of the cheapest renewables. There is only one reliable, sustainable long-term path out of this crisis. That is to get on, now, with the clean energy sprint Labour has been calling for month after month. We should be investing in homegrown onshore wind energy, offshore wind, solar, hydrogen and nuclear energy as well as a national mission to insulate homes. The fourth lesson goes well beyond energy policy. It’s important to recognise that the energy insecurity millions of people face is a consequence of their financial insecurity and our economic insecurity. We live in a country where 80% of people have savings of less than £500. Twelve years of low growth under the Conservatives have left people, on average, much worse off. Read the full opinion piece here: Keir Starmer defended the costs of his plan to freeze energy bills this winter after some economists said it could cost as much as furlough. The Labour leader said during a visit to the Nationwide building society headquarters in Swindon: Our scheme is fully funded. Our scheme actually depends on a windfall tax on the oil and gas companies to maintain that price freeze. We basically have got a choice. We either allow the oil and gas companies to continue to make huge profits while millions of households are really struggling or we do something about it. Our scheme is fully funded and it’s fully funded partly by this windfall tax on the oil and gas companies making excess profits. During a visit to the Nationwide building society headquarters in Swindon, Keir Starmer was asked what action he would take now to deal with the current cost-of-living crisis, rather than focusing on expected rising bills in the winter, PA Media reports. Labour leader said: That’s why we support tailored schemes like the £650 to those on universal credit and into pensions. But what you’ve got from Labour is a fully costed plan to deal with the increases that are likely to come in the autumn and early next year. Contrast that with the zombie government who are producing absolutely no plan and no answers to what they’re going to do about the energy increase in October and then again in January. I can tell you millions of people are really worried about what’s going to happen this autumn and this winter. They’re hearing absolutely nothing from this government. The government has said it is “confident” that people will be able to get a new bivalent Covid-19 jab as part of the autumn booster programme. The UK became the first country in the world to approve Moderna’s bivalent vaccine, which targets both the original strain of the virus and the Omicron variant, but it emerged that the country does not have enough doses to offer the new jab to all people eligible for the booster. About 26 million people will be invited to come forward for a booster jab in the autumn but it is understood only 13m of the new bivalent Moderna jabs are available. The vaccines minister, Maggie Throup, told Good Morning Britain: Obviously we’re getting stocks in other new vaccines ... and we’re getting further stocks as we go through the next few weeks, but there are other vaccines coming online as well. So we are quite confident that we’ll be able to deliver the programme with a bivalent vaccine throughout the next few weeks. But Prof Anthony Harnden, the deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said people eligible for a Covid-19 booster jab should not worry about what type of vaccine they will receive. He told BBC Breakfast: The key point is that people need to get vaccinated rather than worrying too much about the type of vaccine that they’re receiving. These are all very good vaccines, which have proven efficacy against severe disease – that’s hospitalisation and death. Labour is planning a campaigning blitz in order to take ownership of its new energy price cap policy in case the next Tory leader bows to pressure and cancels the 80% rise expected in October. Keir Starmer has vowed that his party “wouldn’t let people pay a penny more” on their gas and electricity bills this winter, proposing freezing the price cap at current levels and preventing the average household bill from reaching £3,600. Senior sources said the party had limited time to get out its message before the next Tory leader, presumed to be Liz Truss, enters No 10. The new prime minister will need to produce a comprehensive package on the cost of living, despite Truss’s reticence to spell out how she would help beyond tax cuts. Labour will increase efforts to promote its policy in the coming days, including with digital adverts, campaign tools for local parties and with direct mail for MPs to use. Plans for the summer offensive have been in the works since mid-July. Over the coming weeks, the party will set out more on its energy policy offer, including plans to upgrade 19m homes to make them more energy efficient, double onshore and offshore wind capacity and triple solar power. Starmer has said Labour’s plan, funded in part by an expanded windfall tax, is the radical approach needed to help households and reduce inflation, contrasting it with the inaction of a “lame duck” government. “We asked ourselves: do we want a plan that allows those prices to go up, causes that anxiety, and then rebates some people after the event, but doesn’t do anything about inflation, or do we want to be more radical, more bold, more ambitious?” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “One of the benefits of our proposal is that it brings inflation down, which benefits everybody, but particularly those who are most vulnerable, and those who are least well off.” Sources close to Starmer say plans for the party conference will need to be adapted on the basis of what the new prime minister announces in the first weeks in office, especially if there is an early emergency budget. Read more from my colleagues Jessica Elgot and Peter Walker here: The real value of UK workers’ pay continued to fall at the fastest rate for 20 years in June as wage increases were outstripped by soaring inflation amid the cost of living crisis. The Office for National Statistics said annual growth in average pay, excluding bonuses, strengthened to 4.7% in the three months to June against a backdrop of low unemployment and high job vacancies. However, the real value of workers’ pay packets dropped by 3% – the fastest decline since comparable records began in 2001 – after taking account of its preferred measure of inflation. Growth in average earnings including bonuses was 5.1%, although also failed to keep pace with the soaring cost of living. The latest snapshot showed early signs of a slowdown in hiring demand among employers despite job vacancies remaining close to a record high. The ONS said unemployment rose slightly to 3.8% in the three months to June, while the number of new job openings fell for the first time since summer 2020. Growth in employment slowed to 160,000 in the three months to June, well below analysts’ forecasts, suggesting the jobs market is beginning to cool as Britain’s economic performance falters. Ruth Gregory, a senior UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: “June’s labour market figures revealed further evidence that the weaker economy is leading to a slightly less tight labour market.” The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said the latest figures showed Britain’s jobs market was in a strong position, with unemployment lower than at almost any point in the past 40 years. “[That is] good news in what I know are difficult times for people,” he said. “Although there are no easy solutions to the cost of living pressures people are facing, we are providing help where we can. We are delivering a £37bn package of help for households through cash grants and tax cuts so people can keep more of what they earn.” However, the figures underlining the unprecedented hit for workers’ pay are likely to add to the pressure on the government and Conservative leadership candidates amid the cost of living crisis. Labour said the figures showed the Tories had lost control of the economy. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “This zombie government is offering no solutions to the cost of living crisis.” Read the full story here: People haven’t seen the full extent of what the government is doing to help with the cost of living crisis, Maggie Throup has said, amid increasing criticism and accusations that Boris Johnson is a “lame-duck” prime minister. The public health minister told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: We’ve already put together a 37 billion [package] that is being rolled out and there’s lots of different aspects of that: helping pensioners; helping those on low pay; helping people generally, and people haven’t seen the full extent of that. Asked about whether Rishi Sunak should have a clear policy on how to deal with the crisis, she said: I think it’s quite right that we wait until we know who is our new leader – prime minister – and then they will take on a lot of advice about the legacy situation. Only last week the prime minister’s assistant secretary and the chancellor met with energy companies and they started talking, and also the civil service [has] put together different options to put in front of whoever it is in September, to make sure that very quickly we know exactly how people are going to be helped. Asked whether Sunak should stand down from the leadership race, Throup replied: I think it is quite right that we wait for the outcome of the election, we haven’t got long to go. And I don’t think any candidate should stand down because until we know the actual results on the day, everything’s to play for. The government is concerned about how the cost of living crisis will affect people’s health and has taken it into consideration when planning the rollout of flu and Covid booster jabs, a minister said. The public health and vaccines minister, Maggie Throup, was speaking on LBC radio about the new dual-variant Covid vaccine that has been approved for use in the UK’s booster programme. She was asked about the impact the cost-of-living crisis will have on health and whether the government had taken it into consideration. LBC’s Nick Ferrari said: “A lot of people saying they’re so concerned about energy prices, they won’t be able to turn the gas up and it is feared more people will die than is usual.” Throup responded: Well, that is a concern, it’s something that we’ve taken into consideration when we looked at our vaccination programmes. We are rolling out the Covid jab, we’re also rolling out the flu jab, providing as much protection as we can to those who are most vulnerable, and where possible will be co-administrating the flu and the Covid jab so people can have both jabs at one go. And I think if people are reassured about their own health, then it helps to take the pressure off some of the other concerns that they may have. And yes, you’re right, people who perhaps don’t heat their homes as much will be more vulnerable. And that’s why, as I say, we’re putting that ring of protection around the most vulnerable with our vaccine programme. Welcome to today’s politics liveblog. I’ll be covering for Andrew Sparrow today.

In the windiest country in Europe, it finally ended a five-year block on new onshore wind turbines. It’s a victory for campaigners, and anyone who wants action on the climate crisis and cares about lower energy bills in future. The government has hopefully ended a strategy – begun by David Cameron in 2015 – of making energy policy in direct contradiction to public opinion. No two issues define this tendency more than the government’s seemingly unshakeable support for fracking – and the insistent de facto ban on new onshore wind turbines. Of course, it didn’t actually ban new onshore wind turbines in 2015. Making them illegal would have been absurd. Instead, post-election, it swiftly attacked from two angles. First, it imposed onerous planning barriers on new wind projects in England, which led planning applications to shrivel by 95% by 2018. Second, it prevented onshore wind projects from bidding for the kind of long-term clean energy contracts that are available to other power sources like nuclear and offshore wind farms that are needed to get them built. Perversely, this was only possible by also blocking solar power from the auctions – meaning the two cheapest sources of clean energy were suddenly out in the cold. In subsequent years, the government’s own in-depth attitude trackers showed public support for fracking plummeting as low as 15% by 2018, yet it backed the industry to the hilt – even proposing at one point to make fracking wells “permitted developments”, effectively reducing them to the planning status of a garden wall. Over the same period, 75% of the public supported onshore wind turbines – by this point cheaper than any source of power from fossil fuels. The government response was to look the other way, despite the UK having a world-class wind resource, and new turbines being the cheapest way to provide power for its citizens. That was until the announcement on Monday that the next round of clean energy auctions, to be held in 2021, would include both onshore wind and solar once more. These auctions award contracts that effectively set a floor price for power sold from new projects, which in effect acts as a subsidy over the lifetime of the project if the floor price is higher than the market price for power. Onshore wind is now so cheap its floor price is expected to be at, or even below, current market prices. To translate, that means new onshore wind projects should be free of government subsidy, another bell tolling on the future of fossil fuels. It shouldn’t have been this hard – and we’ve certainly lost valuable time – but climate campaigners should celebrate forcing the reversal of fortunes between fracking and wind. The former is now fighting for survival, the latter is back in from the cold – just as the public wanted. Add in bringing forward the petrol and diesel car ban to 2035, a pledge to spend £9bn on domestic energy efficiency in the Conservative election manifesto and the decision not to appeal the seismic Heathrow judgment, and you might be forgiven for wondering if we’re seeing something bigger at work within this new government. Of course, it’s too early to tell for sure. The fracking industry was brought to its knees by a combination of brave and indefatigable grassroots campaigning and Tory MPs vexed at what fracking meant for their constituencies. It became clear the government was backing a losing horse. With the economics and social licence of fossil fuels receding weekly, it seems unlikely to remount any time soon. An almost equally long-standing – though less high-profile – public campaign helped ensure the thorn of onshore wind never left the government’s side. But its success is perhaps indicative that from atop his 80-seat majority, Boris Johnson is indeed willing to upset backbenchers to take action on the climate crisis. Make no mistake: there will be parliamentary colleagues of his for whom this change in direction is the stuff of nightmares. A backlash from the usual suspects orbiting 55 Tufton Street – the London home of many groups associated with climate denial – can’t be far off. So, will it stick? This is a question with relevance not just to wind turbines, but to much of what lies ahead if we are to cut emissions rapidly. Whether it’s the intrusive work of replacing domestic gas boilers, the fraught territory of reducing private car use, or delicate nudges to shift diets, around each policy corner lies a potential battle. As ever, this risk is exacerbated when policies are seen to be imposed from above. Yet new wind turbines could be owned and led directly by communities, councils, local businesses or key services such as hospitals. There is no reason wind projects can’t become synonymous with bottom-up climate action that communities are proud of and benefit from. That would put them beyond the reach of reactionary scaremongering. Yet for this to happen, yesterdays’s announcement only takes us so far. In England, while the block on onshore wind competing for clean energy contracts has been lifted, onerous planning blocks on turbines still remain. This rules out a full wind renaissance south of the border. The government must have the courage to remove them, so we can start building our new energy system – this time from the ground up. • Max Wakefield is director of campaigns at the climate action organisation Possible"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2019/oct/21/uk-firm-highview-power-announces-plans-for-first-liquid-to-gas-cryogenic-battery","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-21T16:42:46Z","webTitle":"UK firm announces plans for first 'liquid to gas' cryogenic battery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/21/uk-firm-highview-power-announces-plans-for-first-liquid-to-gas-cryogenic-battery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/oct/21/uk-firm-highview-power-announces-plans-for-first-liquid-to-gas-cryogenic-battery","fields":{"headline":"UK firm announces plans for first 'liquid to gas' cryogenic battery","bodyText":"British battery pioneers plan to build Europe’s largest energy storage project using a cryogenic battery that can store renewable energy for weeks rather than hours. The device will be built on the site of an old fossil fuel plant in the north of England to power up to 50,000 homes for up to five hours. Unlike traditional lithium-ion batteries, which typically store electricity for a few hours, the “cryobattery” will be able to store energy for months. The UK’s first full-scale cryobattery, developed by Highview Power, uses renewable electricity to chill air to -196C, transforming it into a liquid that will be stored in large metal tanks. When renewable electricity levels are low the liquid can be turned back into gas, which is used to turn a turbine and generate electricity – but without burning the gas and releasing emissions. Highview Power claims its cryobattery will be the largest project in Europe capable of long-term energy storage. The full-scale “liquid air” battery has a capacity of 50MW or 250MWh over a five-hour release time. It follows the success of a 5MW pathfinder project built next to a landfill site in Bury, Greater Manchester, in summer 2018 with £8m of funding from Innovate UK. The chief executive of Highview Power said the battery could provide cost-efficient energy storage at old fossil fuel plants across the country to help balance the energy system. “More and more power plants are going to be decommissioned, and we are bringing a solution which can use the same energy infrastructure and grid connections to give a new life to these sites,” Javier Cavada said. He added that long-duration, giga-scale energy storage was the “necessary foundation” to help build a carbon-free energy system that relies heavily on wind and solar power. The global shift towards clean electricity has spurred a boom in battery technology development to help harness wind and solar energy, and a flurry of investment plans from energy utilities. Highview said the cryobattery would cost about £110 per MWh of electricity, using a 200MW system, which would make it one of the cheapest energy storage technologies. The claim comes after an Edinburgh-based start-up, Gravitricity, said Britain’s cheapest virtual battery could be created by hoisting and dropping 12,000-tonne weights down disused mine shafts. A study by Imperial College London said the gravity energy could cost $171 (£132) per MWh, compared with an average lithium-ion project of $367 (£283) per MWh. Cavada said the company planned to finalise agreements with its project partner and would secure deals with National Grid to help provide grid balancing services. He declined to comment on the name of the disused power plant Highview planned to use."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/oct/22/clive-palmer-company-re-applies-for-mine-four-times-size-of-adanis-carmichael","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-21T17:00:40Z","webTitle":"Clive Palmer company reapplies for mine four times size of Adani's Carmichael","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/22/clive-palmer-company-re-applies-for-mine-four-times-size-of-adanis-carmichael","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/oct/22/clive-palmer-company-re-applies-for-mine-four-times-size-of-adanis-carmichael","fields":{"headline":"Clive Palmer company reapplies for mine four times size of Adani's Carmichael","bodyText":"A Clive Palmer-controlled company has applied for a mining lease and environmental authority to build a massive coalmine four times the size of Adani’s in the Queensland Galilee Basin. The Galilee Coal project – formerly called China First – has not progressed since it gained federal environmental approval in late 2013. Notification that Waratah Coal has renewed its 2011 application for a mining lease and environmental authority was issued by Queensland’s coal assessment hub on 4 October. The only public notice advising people to comment on the proposal – by a deadline of 2 December – was placed in the classifieds section of a weekly newspaper based in the central Queensland town of Emerald on Friday. Waratah Coal has been contacted for comment. The proposed mine is about 100km from Adani’s Carmichael project and would require many of its own pieces of supporting infrastructure. Waratah Coal plans to build two open-cut pits, four underground mines – removing a total of 40m tonnes a year – and a 453km railway linking the project to the Adani-owned Abbot Point coal terminal near Bowen. Waratah Coal is also seeking federal environmental approval for its proposed Alpha North coalmine in the Galilee Basin. Carmichael is the most advanced of seven large mine proposals in the Galilee Basin. While many question the economics of projects that require new infrastructure and long-distance haulage to reach ports, there has been considerable interest in whether other proponents would follow Adani by seeking to progress their plans, which in some cases have been dormant for several years. Palmer, who has said he deliberately “polarised the electorate” with a $60m advertising spend before this year’s federal election, also unveiled plans to build a coal-fired power station in central Queensland a week before polling day. In July, Palmer indicated he could use cash from a windfall court win against the Chinese firm Citic to progress his plans in the Galilee. He told the Australian Financial Review he might seek to use an underground sludge pipeline to export coal rather than building a railway. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “A pipeline is much more environmentally friendly, it’s underground, it could be powered by solar power on the surface, using renewable energy,” he said. Lock the Gate coordinator Carmel Flint said it was unclear whether Waratah Coal had done additional work on water impacts, which had been required by the Queensland coordinator general. “It’s potentially a quick process to get a mining lease or environmental authority. I’d imagine people will object to this. There will be water impacts, so I imagine there will be a lot of concerns.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/jan/16/uk-green-economy-has-shrunk-since-2014","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-16T19:21:18Z","webTitle":"UK green economy has shrunk since 2014","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/16/uk-green-economy-has-shrunk-since-2014","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/jan/16/uk-green-economy-has-shrunk-since-2014","fields":{"headline":"UK green economy has shrunk since 2014","bodyText":"Britain’s green economy has shrunk since 2014, heightening concerns that the government will miss targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the decade. The number of people employed in the “low carbon and renewable energy economy” declined by more than 11,000 to 235,900 between 2014 and 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Green businesses fared little better, seeing their numbers drop from an estimated 93,500 to 88,500 over the same four-year period. The ONS said there was a small increase in the number of people employed in the green economy between 2016 and 2018, but this was not enough to offset a huge drop in the number of jobs and businesses between 2014 and 2016. Critics of the Conservative government’s record of support for the low carbon and renewables sector blamed the Treasury’s dramatic cut in subsidies to the solar power industry for the sudden loss of employment. Solar panel installers were among the many businesses connected to the industry that went bust after the Treasury cut subsidy payments by 65% in 2015 before abolishing them altogether last year. Of the UK’s four countries, England saw the biggest fall in the number of green jobs followed by Northern Ireland and Scotland. Wales was the only area to see an increase – from 10,000 to 11,400 jobs. Adding to the downbeat analysis, the ONS said the recent increase in activity was also mainly due to acquisitions in the renewable sector rather than an increase in investment. A report by the Committee on Climate Change, an independent government advisory body, found that UK emissions met the government’s 2018 target, following a decline in emissions to 44% below 1990 levels. But a recent slowdown meant it was “not on track” to meet the next target, which covers the period 2023-27, or to reduce emissions by at least 100% of 1990 levels by 2050. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial strategy said the figures for 2014 were distorted by a change in the way the ONS estimated employment and that since 2015 the number of green jobs had risen from 200,000 by more than 24,000. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, said: “A greener economy creates enormous opportunities for new employment, with the low-carbon sector potentially supporting 2m green-collar jobs by 2030. “As we seek to end our contribution to climate change entirely by 2050, I am determined that these numbers will increase even further in the years ahead.” TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said recent progress was “still far too slow” and meant the government had a “dreadful record”. The Royal Society of Arts and Manufacturing said the figures “should be a wake-up call for ministers” who have pledged to cut greenhouse emissions to net zero by 2050. The thinktank’s director of economics, Asheem Singh, said: “It is pretty clear that the UK is well behind in meeting its next milestones and the 2050 target. “Reaching the target is inextricably linked to the growth of the green economy and it is clear from these figures that this just isn’t happening.” Britain’s renewable energy industry has expanded in the last three years, mainly in response to the growth of offshore windfarms. The share of total electricity generation from renewables reached 38.9% in September, the highest recorded and higher than gas generation for the first time. But the industry employs relatively few workers in service companies while most turbines are manufactured abroad, limiting the scope for a dramatic rise in the number of people employed across the industry. The ONS figures showed that £6.3bn worth of imports of renewables and low carbon services exceeded the value of exports by £1.2bn, leaving the UK with a 20% deficit in the balance of green trade. Caterina Brandmayr, senior policy analyst at Green Alliance said the figures “expose the yawning gap between the UK’s net zero law and policy in most government departments to drive decarbonisation”. She said most efforts to cut carbon had focused on the offshore wind sector, “but other sectors have huge untapped potential to decarbonise”. She added: “Efforts to cut carbon emissions from transport and buildings have been woefully unambitious. Transport emissions have flatlined since 1990 and buildings energy efficiency policy has been stalled for years. And there is very little policy at all to improve industry’s resource efficiency.” The Treasury is expected to put forward several measures to encourage investment in industries that promise to reduce carbon emissions, but investments are likely to take several years to bear fruit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/live/2021/nov/08/cop26-obama-to-speak-survey-shows-few-will-change-lifestyle-for-climate-day-eight-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-08T18:19:35Z","webTitle":"Cop26: Obama criticises China and Russia for ‘dangerous absence of urgency’ – day eight as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2021/nov/08/cop26-obama-to-speak-survey-shows-few-will-change-lifestyle-for-climate-day-eight-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/live/2021/nov/08/cop26-obama-to-speak-survey-shows-few-will-change-lifestyle-for-climate-day-eight-live","fields":{"headline":"Cop26: Obama criticises China and Russia for ‘dangerous absence of urgency’ – day eight as it happened","bodyText":"That’s me done for today! Here is the evening summary of today’s events: The legitimacy of the Cop26 climate summit was called into question by a number of organisations who said restrictions on access to negotiations were unprecedented. The fossil fuel industry has the largest delegation at Cop26, according to campaigners, who say the sector has more people attending than any other country. Analysis of the UN’s provisional list of attendees suggests that 503 delegates have affiliations to oil gas or coal firms. Barack Obama called on world leaders to “step up now” and criticised China and Russia for a “dangerous absence of urgency” on the climate crisis. But China is doing more for the climate than it’s given credit for, according to a senior Beijing adviser who said the country already has concrete actions in place, not distant targets like other countries. Meanwhile, protesters gathered in Glasgow for the Scientist Rebellion protest. One academic said that not acting on the climate crisis “might just be the worst crime in human history”. Police broke into a building providing shelter for climate activists and delegates in the early hours of this morning, occupants say. Survivors of extreme weather associated with the climate crisis have been speaking out at Cop26 on the day the summit focuses on “loss and damage”. Rich countries’ refusal to discuss loss and damage is “diplomatic bullying”, says Bolivia’s chief negotiator, Diego Pacheco Balanza. Rich countries must also come up with emissions reduction plans and money to help developing nations deal with the climate emergency, says the European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans. Finally, African nations want to start open discussions at Cop26 about channeling $700bn (£520bn) every year from 2025 to help them deal with the climate crisis. I leave you with the news that Glenfiddich distillery has created a limited-edition 26-year-old whisky to commemorate Cop26. There will be a charity auction later this month, with all proceeds going to Stop Climate Chaos Scotland. Have a great evening. Phoebe African nations want Cop26 to open discussions this week on a mega-financing deal that would channel $700bn (£520bn) every year from 2025 to help developing nations adapt to the climate crisis. Tanguy Gahouma-Bekale, the chair of the African Group of Negotiators on climate change, said the increased finance was needed for the accelerated phase of decarbonisation required to hold global heating to 1.5C. He said: “The work on this needs to start now ... Talks about finance take time so we need to have a roadmap now with clear milestones on how to achieve targets after 2025 to ensure the money flows every year.” Read the full story here: The European Union’s most senior climate envoy has called on other rich countries to come up with emissions reduction plans and money to help developing nations deal with the climate emergency. The European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans said he hoped to convince other major emitters “not just to declare a date for carbon neutrality or climate neutrality” but come forward with policies to achieve it. Since the EU agreed its net zero goal in 2019, it has proposed a vast set of legal proposals to transform the European economy, although the measures are yet to be agreed by the EU member states and European parliament. Timmermans said: “If we don’t make a success of this Cop, it’s difficult to see how we can reduce [in] half the emissions in less than ten years. It needs to happen right now.” Earlier in the day, the veteran Dutch MEP Bas Eickhout sounded a note of caution on climate pledges unveiled last week, which suggested the world could restrict global heating to below 2C. “We all have to acknowledge there is a huge difference in the value of these pledges,” he said “Some pledges are really serious, for example the EU with its Fit for 55 package. But for example the pledge of Australia is literally a brochure.” Timmermans, a former Dutch foreign minister, also called on wealthy countries to close the gap in fulfilling a long-standing promise to mobilise $100bn a year to help developed countries deal with the climate crisis. “We have been doing our share as the EU … I am not complacent at all but I am just saying to the other developed countries if we can do our share I am sure you can do your share,” he said. We all have to acknowledge there is a huge difference in the value of these pledges. Some pledges are really serious, for example the EU with its Fit for 55 package. But for example the pledge of Australia is literally a brochure. Timmermans didn’t name names, but it’s no secret that the EU expects the United States to go far beyond Joe Biden’s recent goal to aim for an $11.4bn contribution by 2024. But the EC vice president was also challenged on the EU’s own leadership credentials, when the Guardian’s Fiona Harvey asked him about countries such as Poland and Germany that planned to keep coal in their energy mix for some years to come. Timmermans conceded that coal was a big challenge, but insisted the EU was making progress, citing ongoing talks in Germany to form a governing coalition that could speed up the coal phase out, as well as changes in Poland’s stance on energy. “Things are speeding up for political reasons, for climate reasons but also simply because coal doesn’t have a future,” he said. Youth climate activists: Can Cop26 save the world? Guardian Live is holding a special live stream event with young climate activists from around the world on Wednesday 10 November 2021, 8pm GMT. It will be hosted by the film director Franny Armstrong. Tickets are available here In an interview with the Guardian, Bolivia’s chief negotiator, Diego Pacheco Balanza, blasted the refusal by rich countries to discuss loss and damage or compensation at Cop26 as evidence of “diplomatic bullying”. “There’s been a systematic attempt by developed countries to remove all discussion about responsibility, compensation and direct climate finance from the negotiations, it’s shameful,” he said. “Instead, they want us to focus on carbon markets and their 2050 net zero narrative which is completely meaningless. The net zero narrative is a big lie. We need to eliminate greenhouse gasses now, not in 30 years.” Net zero has been condemned by the vast majority of civil society groups, social movements and indigenous people as climate denialism as it allows polluting countries and corporations to offset carbon emissions rather than stop emitting them. Pacheco added: “We reject the narrative that the market is the solution. We want to focus on strengthening direct cooperation from developed countries to developing countries. They only want to talk about loans, but we want direct aid and the transfer of knowledge and technologies. They don’t want to discuss loss and damage, only mitigation through forests which will serve as an instrument for carbon credits.” In response to the first draft of the Glasgow decision text, published today, which contains no mention of phasing out fossil fuels, Pacheco said: “It shows how developed countries are trying to impose the net zero and carbon markets narrative, it’s a form of diplomatic bullying. They are always trying to destroy what’s been achieved at previous climate negotiations and start again, so we never move forward.” It should be noted that the governing party has been previously criticised by activists for passing legislation that incentivised farmers to burn forests in order to open up new land to farming and cattle. Here is George Monbiot’s take on this: Survivors of the extreme weather impacts of the climate crisis have been speaking out at Cop26 on the day the summit focuses on “loss and damage” – the phrase used for the unavoidable and increasing harm from global heating. “When the death toll reached 6,300 they stopped counting,” said Marinel Ubaido, the Philippines and a survivor of super typhoon Haiyan, which hit eight years ago today. “There are still 1,600 plus dead bodies missing.” “Today we’re still shouting for justice for our friends and families who have lost their lives,” she said. “We are fighting for a future that is not riddled with anxiety and fear that another Haiyan might come anytime. We do not deserve to live in fear. We deserve a hopeful future. We demand urgent action.” Many people remain in the same vulnerable places, Ubaido said, as their livelihoods are there. “I feel so tired of just fleeing and evacuating and then I don’t even know if we will have a house to go back to.” Jo Dodds, from the small coastal town of Tarthra, in New South Wales, Australia, said 69 of its 400 homes have been destroyed by wildfires since 2018: “Since then, I have lived in fear. It’s destroying our communities, it’s killing our people. “People talk about bushfire being a normal aspect of Australian climates, but I can tell you these are not,” she said. “There is nobody who isn’t extremely alarmed at the catastrophic heat and speed and unpredictability of these fires. We’ve had fires during the winter with snow on the hills behind us that went on for seven weeks.” Dodds said: “Australia should be stepping up to help developing countries who are feeling the impact of climate change even more profoundly than we are. But it’s not even helping its own people.” It’s destroying our communities, it’s killing our people. Sven Harmeling, at the NGO Care, said loss and damage has been part of Cop discussions for at least eight years, but was not getting the serious attention it needs: “Developing countries still need to fight over whether to [even] have an agenda item or not. “There must be clear progress on loss and damage and identifying new sources of finance,” he said. “Without that, this Cop cannot be a successful response to climate injustice. This is absolutely required to help stop this climate madness.” Yamide Dagnet, at the World Resources Institute, said: “The ostrich policy, from developed countries who hide behind the fear of liability and compensation, has not worked and is not working.” She noted that Tuvalu and Antigua and Barbuda have said they may sue to get the money. Lisa Plattner, at WWF-Austria said the economic impacts of global heating are estimated at $290bn to $580bn a year up to 2030. She said it was down to Alok Sharma and the UK presidency to make progress happen this week: “This is the time of the presidency.” The occupants of a squatted building in Glasgow, which was occupied to provide emergency accommodation for climate activists and delegates, have accused police of trying to break into their site with a battering ram early on Monday morning. The activists at Baile Hoose, a derelict homeless shelter in the Tradeston district, said up to 20 officers from the Metropolitan police and Welsh forces mounted the raid at 3am, claiming to be acting under the orders of the Scottish police. The activists said Police Scotland officers arrived before those involved in the raid entered the squatted parts of the complex and “calmed the situation. [It] was only then that the Met and Welsh police backed off”. One occupant said: “Baile Hoose has provided a safe home and meals for hundreds of activists during this summit. There have been a lot of people who have travelled here from all over the world and the country, and quite often people from marginalised communities are not getting their voices heard.” Glasgow city council, which owns the building, asked the activists to leave last week, warning its water supply could be unsafe, and the building could contain asbestos. A police spokesperson said: “Around 3am on Monday 8 November, officers attended at a property on Centre Street, Glasgow, following concerns for the safety and security of those using the building. Officers will continue to engage with those currently in the property.” Just as Obama finishes his speech in the blue zone, a large crowd has gathered on the south side of King George V bridge in Glasgow for a Scientist Rebellion protest. The group has been banned from the city centre after blocking the bridge over the weekend, when 21 activists were arrested. “It was the first mass arrest of scientists over the climate crisis in history,” said theoretical physicist Mike Lynch-White, one of those arrested. He said the protest was the first disruptive action during the summit that wasn’t preemptively stopped by the police. “We were banned from the centre of Glasgow even though all we were trying to do is non-violently disobey and prevent climate collapse. It’s not proportionate, it’s not reasonable,” he said. “There are people all over Glasgow right now making choices which are going to lead to enormous human suffering but it’s the people who are trying to highlight that facing restrictions and loss of freedom,” said astrophysicist Dr Tim Hewlett. “On an individual level the police have been quite decent to us, but I’m sure that’s mainly because we are wearing white [lab] coats.” He said his profession gives him a unique perspective, adding the climate crisis “might not just be the worst crime in human history, it could be the worst crime in the galaxy.” Obama enters the final stanza of his speech by saying that averting disastrous global hearing “will not be easy, it is going to be hard”, citing slow-moving governments, cynical businesses and misinformation spread on social media. “Getting people to work together on a global scale takes time and right now that’s time we don’t have,” he said. He then launches into a plea to work with those who are indifferent to the climate crisis, or who are affected by the transition to clean energy, and asks those in the room to prepare for messy compromises. “Gird yourself for a marathon, not a sprint,” he says, before quoting Shakespeare’s Othello: “What wound did ever heal but by degrees? “Our planet has been wounded by our actions, those wounds won’t be healed today or tomorrow [but] I believe we can secure a better future,” he says. “We have to. “To all the young people out there, as well as those who consider yourself young at heart, I want you to stay angry. I want you to stay frustrated. But challenge that anger and harness that frustration. Keep pushing harder and harder for more and more – because that is what is required to meet this challenge.” Obama finishes by saying: “I’m ready for the long haul if you are, so let’s get to work.” There is rapturous applause from the audience. “It is going to be hard,” Obama says about keeping temperatures to below 1.5C. “International co-operation has always been difficult, it is made more difficult by misinformation and propaganda that comes out of social media these days. “Getting people to work together on a global scale takes time, and that’s time we don’t have ... If we work hard enough for long enough, those partial victories add up.” Obama tells Cop26 delegates we won’t have more ambitious climate plans without pressure from voters. “It will not be enough to simply mobilise the converted, it will not be enough to preach to the choir … Protests are necessary to raise awareness, hashtag campaigns can spread awareness,” he said. He is encouraging young people to speak to their families about climate change because they will listen, saying it’s important to convert people who do not agree, or are indifferent to the issue. “We have to do a little more listening – we can’t just yell at them or say they’re ignorant, or tweet at them,” he said. “The most important energy in this movement is coming from young people,” says Obama, who references his two daughters, both in their early 20s. “The reason is simple – they have more stake in this fight than anyone else. That is why I want to spend the rest of my time today talking to young people. “If those older people won’t listen, they need to get out the way,” he said. One youth activist, Alexandria Villaseñor, said lots of young people hadn’t been able to get into the room to hear Obama speak. Barack Obama is currently addressing a very full room, opening with a cheery ‘Hello, Glasgow!’ The former US president, tieless and looking relaxed, says that he doesn’t need to attend such conferences anymore but “you will have a hard time keeping me away” when it comes to the future of the planet. Obama says that “meaningful progress” has been made since the Paris climate accords, which he helped to strike, but acknowledges that more needs to be done. “What is also true, collectively and individually we are still falling short,” he says. “We have not done nearly enough to address this crisis, we will need to do more.” Obama admits that “some progress stalled” when Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris deal. “I wasn’t real happy about that,” he adds, but says the “US is back” under Joe Biden’s leadership. He also believes that, despite opposition within the Democratic party, some version of Biden’s ambitious $555bn climate package will pass in Congress in the coming weeks. “It will set the United States on course to meet its new climate targets,” he says. In 2015, rapport between Obama administration negotiators and their Chinese counterparts was seen as paving the way to the global Paris accord. Obama criticised Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin for not joining other global leaders at the climate talks in Glasgow, saying he found it “particularly disappointing” that their leaders haven’t shown up to Cop26. He blames the pandemic and the rise of nationalism for a breakdown in international relations that has affected dealing with the climate crisis. He also has a dig at Republicans back home for showing “active hostility” to climate science.” “One thing should transcend day to day politics and geopolitics and that’s climate change,” Obama says. “The world has to step up and it has to step up now.” The 44th US president admits that sometimes he feels “bleak” about the future of humanity and that “images of dystopia start creeping into my dreams”. But he called on leaders and activists not to give in to cynicism and praised the work of young climate campaigners, which provokes the first round of applause during his speech. As Obama appeals for more help for those on the frontline of the climate crisis and calls to end years of deadlock over cash for climate-linked damages and losses, here is a message from a climate activist, Vanessa Nakate - Hello! Phoebe Weston here, I’m taking over the live blog this afternoon, if you have any questions/tips/comments please get in touch: phoebe.weston@guardian.co.uk That is all from me. I am handing over to my colleague Phoebe Weston who will update you on developments at COP26 this afternoon. Follow her on Twitter at @phoeb0. If you are looking for a change of pace, the world champion poet Emi Mahmoud has released a poem about the impacts that climate change is having on displaced people around the world. Here is an extract from Di Baladna: If you are reading this, I forgive you. You have grown far from the heart of me, my child have lost the familiar love we held for one another in your first years of life. When you were young, you marvelled at the plants and critters that ran across my bosom, you worshiped the water, swam up and down my rivers, drank from my rain, laughed at each first snow, begged for sun on the cloudy days. Watch Mahmoud perform the poem in full here. Greenpeace has been reacting to the first draft of the Glasgow final decision text which countries are working to agree at Cop26. They describe it as “exceptionally weak” and point out that it fails to mention phasing out fossil fuels. Greenpeace says the first draft of a Cop text is usually relatively ambitious before it is negotiated down by countries for a final agreement. “For the first draft to be so weak does not bode well,” the group says. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, says: “To keep 1.5 alive, four words must be added: ‘fossil fuels phase out’, and countries must come back next year to close the gap.” The former US president has been speaking for the first time at Cop26 at an event with leaders of island states threatened by rising oceans. He tells the event he is “an island kid”, describing islands as the “canary in the coalmine” for action on the climate. Obama says “our islands are threatened more than ever” and praises the current US president Joe Biden for giving them the attention they deserve. He says wealthy nations “have an added burden to make sure we are working with and helping and assisting those who are less responsible and less able but more vulnerable to this oncoming crisis”. He concludes his remarks with a Hawaiian proverb: “Unite to move forward.” Obama says: “It’s a reminder that if you all want to paddle a canoe you better all be rowing in the same direction and at the same time, every oar has to move in unison, that’s the only way that you move forward.” He says he defends US negotiators, saying they stick up for island nations in domestic politics. The former US president has arrived in the blue zone. Here are some photos of his arrival alongside the US climate envoy John Kerry. My colleague Jonathan Watts, the Guardian’s global environment editor, has been speaking with Chinese negotiators about their thoughts on progress so far in Glasgow. Chinese officials are sceptical of claims that Cop26 commitments will keep global heating below 2C, and want other countries to focus on concrete actions rather than distant targets in the final week of the talks, he reports. They feel that China, the world’s biggest emitter, is doing more than it is given credit for, including plans to peak coal consumption by 2025 and add more wind and solar power capacity by 2030 than the entire installed electricity system of the US. “There has been a lot of criticism of China’s attitude in the media, but many of them are based on incomprehension or misunderstanding,” said Wang Yi, a senior adviser to the Chinese delegation. Read the full story below. Lee White, Gabon’s environment minister, is giving an update on behalf of the Africa group in the plenary. Carbon Brief’s Simon Evans has the key technical points covered. Outside of the plenary, the world’s media is waiting for the arrival of Barack Obama. The BBC’s science editor, David Shukman, has posted a picture from inside the blue zone. The fossil fuel industry has hundreds of people accredited to the key climate talks in Glasgow - giving the sector a bigger delegation than any country, campaigners have claimed. Analysis of the UN’s provisional list of named attendees suggests 503 delegates at Cop26 who are either directly affiliated with fossil fuel companies or are part of country delegations but are affiliated to oil, gas or coal firms, PA reports. That means fossil fuel representation outstrips the largest single country delegation by around two dozen people, according to the assessment by campaigners at Corporate Accountability, Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO), Glasgow Calls Out Polluters and Global Witness. Fossil fuel lobbyists far outweigh the delegations of some of the most vulnerable countries at the conference, which has also faced criticism for a lack of access for at-risk countries and communities because of travel restrictions and a lack of vaccines in developing nations due to the pandemic. The groups said their analysis showed that more than 100 fossil fuel companies are represented at the climate talks, where countries are under pressure to cut emissions that mostly come from oil, gas and coal to curb dangerous warming, as well as 30 trade bodies and member organisations. 27 official country delegations registered fossil fuel lobbyists, including Canada, Russia and Brazil, the campaigners said. Murray Worthy, gas campaign leader at Global Witness, said: “With the world quickly running out of time to avert climate disaster, this Cop absolutely must be a success. “The case for meaningful global action must not be diverted by a festival of polluters and their mouthpieces, who have no interest in seeing the changes we need to protect people and the planet. “The presence of hundreds of those being paid to push the toxic interests of polluting fossil fuel companies will only increase the scepticism of climate activists who see these talks as more evidence of global leaders’ dithering and delaying.” The negotiator for Guinea is giving an update from the G77+ China group in the plenary. His assessment is much less positive. He expresses his disappointment that wealthy countries have been unwilling to discuss progress on the $100bn [about £74bn] climate finance goal, describing it as “an empty commitment”. Carbon Brief’s deputy editor and policy whizz Simon Evans is posting a thread of technical updates from the G77+ China group. Alok Sharma and the heads of the UN subsidiary bodies have been addressing the plenary about the progress of negotiations at Cop26. The updates are largely technical and amount to a lengthy to-do list for ministers, who have arrived in Glasgow to try to thrash out details that technical teams have not been able to reconcile. Today’s first big event at the People’s Summit is calling out nature based solutions (NBS) – a buzz phrase at Cop26 pushed as the silver bullet to solving the climate crisis and biodiversity crisis with little pain for people in the global north. NBS include the massive forestation commitments, which made headlines at Cop last week, and the expansion of hydroelectric power – both of which activists here say will have devastating impacts on biodiversity, food sovereignty and human rights. Sophie Grig, from Survival International, said the 30 by 30 pledge – 30% of the planet’s land and oceans to be given protected status by 2030 – will lead to a huge increase in abuses against people in the global south who’ve contributed least to the climate crisis, but have been impacted the most. Grig said: “30 by 30 is the biggest land grab in history and will lead to more forced evictions, rapes and murder of indigenous and vulnerable people who rely on forests and grasslands to survive.” The panelists from India, Kenya, Germany, Chile and the Klamath &amp; Modoc tribal nation described the 30 x 30 pledge as a false solution, originally proposed by large conservation NGOs and now supported by rich and polluting countries and corporations keen to offset carbon emissions rather than cut them. Paul Robert Wolf Wilson, a youth activist from the Klamath tribes confederation based in Southern Oregon and Northern California, spoke about the Klamath dam, which has had a devastating impact on salmon runs relied upon by the tribes for thousands of years, and is scheduled for removal in 2023. “It’s taken more than a hundred years of struggle by my people to remove the Klamath dam and recuperate a river that has sustained my people since time memorial,” he said. “False solutions allow polluters to keep polluting. False solutions are killing us. Carbon market trading programmes are arms of genocide.” The People’s Summit continues with about 200 virtual and in-person events across the city taking place through until Wednesday. It’s time for news of an elaborate Monday morning practical joke. The Yes Men, a group of activist pranksters, claimed to have had a fake company accepted as an official member of UN net zero initiatives at Cop26. It later transpired the company, Yasava, is real. Alongside Maersk, Halliburton, Delta, United, American, Heathrow, Edelman, BAE Systems and many others, the Yes Men claimed they had managed to get Yasava, “the world’s leading designer of bespoke couture interiors for private jets”, accepted to two official Cop26 initiatives: the Race to Zero campaign and the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTI). The company is listed as part of the Race to Zero campaign but is not part of the SBTI. Check out Yasava’s website here. It appears to have been made on WordPress and includes phrases like “an aircraft does not simply accommodate you: you wear it”. Campaigners say it raises serious concerns about corporate greenwashing at Cop26 Alan Bell, of Glasgow Calls Out Polluters, said: “This should be a moment of profound embarrassment for Cop26 and the corporate hype around net zero. If the most ridiculous company imaginable can meet the flagship net-zero standard, then we should not take the concept of net zero seriously at all.” This entry was updated on 10 November 2021 after it became clear that Yasava is a real company. They are listed as part of the Race to Zero campaign, but are not part of the SBTI. Chevron and JP Morgan, who were originally listed in this post, are also not part of the SBTI. The EU’s Earth observation programme Copernicus has found that October 2021 was the third warmest in recorded history, with temperatures 0.42C higher than the 1991 to 2020 average. Last month was only marginally cooler than October 2015 and 2019. Northern Canada, northern Russia and eastern Antarctica all experienced much warmer months than average, while southern Africa, southern Australia and western Antarctica experienced cooler conditions. The legitimacy of the Cop26 climate summit has been called into question by civil society participants who say restrictions on access to negotiations are unprecedented and unjust, Nina Lakhani reports. As the Glasgow summit enters its second week, observers representing hundreds of environmental, academic, climate justice, indigenous and women’s rights organisations say excluding them from negotiating areas and speaking to negotiators could have dire consequences for millions of people. Observers act as informal watchdogs of the summit – the eyes and ears of the public during negotiations to ensure proceedings are transparent and reflect the concerns of communities and groups most likely to be affected by decisions. But their ability to observe, interact and intervene in negotiations on carbon markets, loss and damage and climate financing has been obstructed during the first week, the Guardian has been told. Read the full report here. On Sunday, a counter climate summit organised by a coalition of civil society groups kicked off in Glasgow offering a grassroots alternative to what’s happening inside the Cop26 negotiating rooms. The People’s Summit for Climate Justice has brought together movements and communities from across the world to amplify voices, ideas and solutions organisers say are largely absent from talks in Glasgow – including the global green new deal, polluters’ liability, indigenous ecological knowledge and the gulf between net zero and real zero emissions. It’s organised by the Cop26 Coalition, the same folks behind Saturday’s global day of action for climate justice which saw around 200 protests worldwide, including more than 100,000 people take to the streets of Glasgow. The summit opened on Sunday with a People’s Tribunal in which the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was found guilty of failing to effectively and equitably deal with the climate crisis and declared that the body has breached the UN charter. Activists and experts from across the world including former Cop negotiators, gave testimony over four hours against the tribunal organised by Global Justice Now. Presenting the verdict, Vijay Prashad, executive director of the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research, said: “We, the jury, find that the UNFCCC has violated the UN Charter … It has forged an intimate partnership with the very corporations that have created the climate crisis. It has refused to listen to those on the frontlines of the crisis, the one billion youth from the 33 high-risk countries, to listen to those indigenous communities and formerly colonised countries who bear the brunt of a crisis that they did not produce.” Prashad added: “The developed countries pledged to provide $100 billion per year for the climate fund. They have not provided that money, neglecting their own commitments.” If you wanted to catch up on what happened in the first week of Cop26, our global environment editor, Jonathan Watts, has written a comprehensive account of everything you need to know. What’s next? Fiona Harvey has it covered. Good morning! I hope you are feeling well-rested and ready for week two of Cop26. It is adaption, loss and damage day in Glasgow and, as you might have noticed, there is no headline-grabbing commitment on the front pages this morning orchestrated by the UK presidency. The failure of rich countries to meet the $100bn finance target looms large over a day dedicated to highlighting the damage caused by a growing number of wildfires, droughts and other of climate-related disasters. We will be covering the latest news and analysis from Glasgow throughout the day, including from former US president Barack Obama, who will speak in the blue zone this afternoon.

As our homes fill up with more connected devices, funnelling every aspect of our lives into the great cloud of big data, the answer could be something much more alarming than just a few more faulty appliances cluttering up our cupboards. This is one of the unsettling questions at the heart of The Future Starts Here, an exhibition about to open at the V&amp;A in London. It promises to be less of a showcase of Tomorrow’s World-type gadgetry than a thought-provoking probe into where exactly this new generation of smart technology is taking us. “People seem scared of the future at the moment,” says Rory Hyde who, with co-curator Mariana Pestana, has spent the last two years trawling university laboratories and touring Silicon Valley to gather 100 hot-out-of-the-factory innovations, from a low-cost satellite to a solar-powered shirt that can charge a smartphone. “There’s a sense,” he adds, “that all this new technology is arriving so fast that we don’t really understand its implications – or have much of a say in where it’s going. We’re hoping the exhibition will give people the tools to make sense of what’s happening and help them bring about the kind of future they want.” Designed by the provocative Spanish architect Andrés Jaque’s Office for Political Innovation, the exhibition covers four areas – Home, Public, Planetary, Afterlife – and asks things like “We are all connected, but do we feel lonely?” and “If Mars is the answer, what is the question?” The section on the future of the home sets a sinister tone with: “Could your toaster turn against you?” Those expecting to find a killer Dualit on the loose will be disappointed, but there are plenty of things that you might think twice about welcoming into your house, if not for their malevolence then for their apparent uselessness. Alongside Jibo – the first “social robot” for the home, which purports to be “authentically charming” by lolling about like a drunken iMac – we meet Brett, the Berkeley Robot for the Elimination of Tedious Tasks, an ongoing artificial intelligence research project at the University of California. Programmed to learn through trial and error, it shows just how difficult it is to teach a robot to complete a simple chore that we can do without thinking. This clumsy steel toddler may be at the cutting edge of AI and robotics, but here it struggles to even do the laundry. Domination by our robot overlords seems a safe way off. Most of the domestic items on show, from the driverless lawnmower by Bosch (the company that develops much of the technology for self-driving cars, testing it out on mowers first) to voice-controlled smart assistants, are seemingly geared towards the same end: saving us time. There’s no need to go to the trouble of getting out your smartphone to order an Uber when you can simply shout at Alexa. She can turn up the heating and switch on the hi-fi while she’s at it. But these labour-saving devices have increasingly been revealed to be serving a different purpose: the collection of masses of monetisable data. Simply by going about our business in our voluntarily surveilled homes, we are unwittingly carrying out huge amounts of valuable market research for the tech companies and online retailers waiting to sell us more stuff. If there is one device that represents our Faustian pact with the connected home, it’s the Amazon Dash button. In a kind of April Fool’s Day parody of the internet of things, these are wifi-enabled buttons that you stick on your wall next to a branded product, allowing you to restock with the push of a button. There’s a Listerine button for when you run out of mouthwash and an Ariel button for when you’re low on detergent. You can decorate your whole house with these branded buttons that cover everything from Whiskas cat food to Durex condoms. The inconvenience of having to be at home to receive the deliveries, as well as the vast quantities that are delivered, make the whole thing absurd. Adam Greenfield, the army psychologist turned tech analyst, goes further in his prescient book, Radical Technologies: The Design of Everyday Life. “They get data on the time and place of your need,” he writes, “as well as the frequency and intensity, and that data has value. It is, explicitly, an asset, and you can be sure they will exploit that asset in every way their terms and conditions permit them to – including by using it to develop behavioural models that map the terrain of our desires, so as to exploit them with offer greater efficiency in future.” The endgame, Amazon has admitted, is that you won’t even need to press a button: they will ultimately know what you want and when. For the lazy among us, this might sound like a boon. Amazon will know when I’m hungry and drone-deliver a Chinese takeaway straight to my mouth. But, beyond concerns over what’s happening to our data – amplified by the recent Cambridge Analytica revelations – many of these smart-home technologies have proved vulnerable to hacking. As Greenfield points out, there are hundreds of thousands of unsecured webcams around the world, readily accessible to anyone online, while last year there were even claims that intelligence services had found a way to hack Samsung TVs, turning them into domestic snooping devices. There have also been claims that touch-screen light switches can be easily hacked, playing havoc with entire floors of hotels. With this in mind, does anyone really think remotely operated smart front-door locks are such a good idea? The rise of the home as the major new tech battleground was in evidence at this year’s Milan furniture fair. Traditionally the place where high-end design houses launch their latest expensive sofas, this year’s gathering was graced by Google for the first time, with an installation designed to give a touchy-feely fabric-upholstered face to the omniscient tech giant. With images depicting a wholesome young family caressing the latest Google Home product range while draped on beanbags, it was an attempt to show that having a smart home needn’t mean filling your house with grey plastic boxes. “We were very conscious of trying to soften everything we did,” says Ivy Ross, head of design at Google’s hardware division, speaking from the car on her Silicon Valley commute. “Our watchwords were ‘human, optimistic and bold’. We wanted to make everything less shiny and sharp-edged, using rounded corners and muted pastel fabrics.” Available with soft-knit covers in shades of “chalk, fog, coral or charcoal”, the products, from voice-activated assistants to surveillance cameras and VR headsets, look like what might result if Habitat turned to tech. So is the cosy feel meant to distract from the fact that these devices are listening to everything you say in order to better hone Google’s targeted advertising? “I can’t talk about that,” says Ross. “It’s more about how to make the technology blend into your home. Our ultimate goal is to make it disappear.” The Future Starts Here is at the V&amp;A, London, 12 May to 4 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2019/oct/07/uk-universities-in-landmark-deal-to-buy-energy-direct-from-windfarms","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-07T05:01:40Z","webTitle":"UK universities in landmark deal to buy energy direct from windfarms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/07/uk-universities-in-landmark-deal-to-buy-energy-direct-from-windfarms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2019/oct/07/uk-universities-in-landmark-deal-to-buy-energy-direct-from-windfarms","fields":{"headline":"UK universities in landmark deal to buy energy direct from windfarms","bodyText":"Twenty of the UK’s leading universities have struck a £50m deal to buy renewable energy directly from British windfarms for the first time. The collaborative clean energy deal will supply electricity from wind farms across Scotland and Wales to universities including Newcastle University, University of Exeter and Aberystwyth University. The landmark deal, known as a “power purchase agreement” or PPA, is the first time that UK public sector energy users have clubbed together to buy clean electricity. The PPA was arranged by deal brokers at The Energy Consortium and Squeaky Clean Energy to fix the price of renewable electricity from a portfolio British windfarms for the next 10 years. The universities will be guaranteed clean energy by the windfarm owner, Norwegian energy giant Statkraft, which will issue certificates matching the output of the windfarms. James Rolfe, the chief operating officer at Anglia Ruskin University, which is part of the deal, said the university has joined others in declaring a climate emergency, and plans to be climate neutral by 2030. “To support this commitment we aim to source all of our electricity from zero carbon sources by 2025, and this power purchase agreement makes a significant contribution towards this goal whilst delivering financial savings and budget stability,” he added. Richard Murphy, the managing director of The Energy Consortium, said the “groundbreaking deal” would help universities reduce their carbon emissions and save money by accessing the power purchase market for the first time. Murphy helped arrange one of the first major corporate energy deals in Europe in 2008 to supply supermarket giant with renewable energy. Since then the PPAs have remained the preserve of larger, multi-site corporations because most renewable energy developers require hefty deals over long contract periods, according to Murphy. One of the UK’s largest deals was struck last year between Budweiser brewer AB InBev and solar developer Lightsource BP to build 100MW of solar power, without subsidy, to help power their nationwide operations. Last month, Google revealed the company’s $2bn plans for the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. It is made up of 18 separate agreements to supply Google with 1,600MW of electricity from wind and solar projects across the world. Murphy said that collaborative energy purchase deals mean that even small institutions are now “able to navigate a previously inaccessible market” too. “The combined challenge facing the wider public sector is to secure reduced carbon emissions whilst saving money and I am delighted that these universities have secured both,” he said. • This article was amended on 10 October 2019 to clarify that this deal was the first between public sector energy users in the UK"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/live/2021/nov/03/cop26-live-focus-on-finance-as-rishi-sunak-makes-london-net-zero-pledge","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-03T18:33:32Z","webTitle":"Cop26 day 3: model projects 1.9C of heating; Sunak makes London net zero pledge – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2021/nov/03/cop26-live-focus-on-finance-as-rishi-sunak-makes-london-net-zero-pledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/live/2021/nov/03/cop26-live-focus-on-finance-as-rishi-sunak-makes-london-net-zero-pledge","fields":{"headline":"Cop26 day 3: model projects 1.9C of heating; Sunak makes London net zero pledge – as it happened","bodyText":"Evening summary Pledges put forward at Cop26 would limit global temperature rises to below 2C, the first time the world has been on such a trajectory, according to research from the University of Melbourne has found. More than 20 countries and financial institutions have vowed to halt all financing for fossil fuel development overseas and divert the estimated $8bn a year to green energy. The heatwaves and wildfires that caused devastation in Europe this summer would not have happened without global heating, new analysis shows. The staggering take-up of solar power in India has enabled the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to announce a more ambitious climate plan at the Cop26 conference in Glasgow, according to the country’s foreign secretary. Rishi Sunak announced that London will become the world’s “first net-zero finance centre” - but environmentalists reacted with scepticism We are wrapping up the blog for today but join us again tomorrow morning for Day four of Cop26, which will be focusing on energy. Scottish activists have occupied a building in the city centre in order to provide safe and secure accommodation to protesters who have been forced to sleep rough or make do with unsuitable arrangements because of the chronic shortage of affordable lodgings at Cop26. One of the organisers explained that a number of Indigenous elders had approached local activists requesting blankets so that they might sleep rough. “It’s horrific that these people have come to make their voices heard, and we have all this money for the helicopters flying above our heads but these elders don’t have anywhere warm and dignified to sleep.” The lack of affordable accommodation has been well-documented – at previous summits, local government worked with activists to provide hostel-style accommodation for those who could not afford expensive hotel rooms, converting gym halls and community centres into bunkhouses. While recognising that Covid-19 restrictions add an extra layer of difficulty this year, activists have been highly critical of the lack of practical action from Glasgow city council The activists hope to keep the building open for visitors until the end of the conference, but note there is no legal protection for squatting under Scots law. A longer version of the website will be on the website soon. My colleague Libby Brooks has been catching up with activists around Cop26 and found anger and hope on the streets of Glasgow. Ed Miliband, the shadow Cop26 president, has said that capitalism does not need to be overthrown as a prerequisite for action on the climate crisis. Speaking to the Guardian’s Science Weekly podcast for tomorrow’s episode on finance, he said the emphasis must be on greening capitalism, not replacing it with another system. “I think fundamentally changing the way capitalism works is the prerequisite [for action on the climate]. And given the urgency, we’ve got to get on with this. Some people who listen to this podcast want to overthrow capitalism. That’s not me,” he said. “We’ve got nine years to turn this round.” The former Labour leader said the world needed to deal with the “carbon bubble” in the financial system, incubating a financial crisis if companies did not change. “At some point, investors and shareholders will realise we’re gonna have to act ... We could see it actually collapse in all of these investments that we’ve invested in.” The interview will be available on the Guardian’s Science Weekly podcast, which is producing an episode every day for Cop26. Here is the full story as promised earlier, revealing how 20 countries - including UK and US - are ending financing of fossil fuels overseas. In a significant move, it has emerged that more than 20 countries and financial institutions will halt all financing for fossil fuel development overseas and divert the spending to green energy instead from next year. The countries affected include the US, UK, Denmark and some developing countries, including Costa Rica. The European Investment Bank is one of the financial institutions involved. Diverting their funding from fossil fuels to low-carbon efforts will generate an estimated $8bn a year around the world for clean energy. The agreement will prevent the funding of any fossil fuel development, including gas, though there are provisions for loopholes. My colleagues Fiona Harvey and Patrick Greenfield will have the full story shortly. Labour’s Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, has sounded a loud note of caution over claims promises made at Cop26 are on course to see temperature increase by less than 2C. Climate activist Greta Thunberg has made her own pledge at Cop26 today. After being filmed chanting “you can shove your climate crisis up your arse” with fellow protesters in Glasgow, she tweeted: Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist [and wit], replied Climate Action Network (CAN), a global network of 1,500 or so environmental civil society organisations in more than 130 countries, used their first press conference to call out the lack of concrete details and ambition so far on crucial issues like reducing emissions, climate finance and loss and damage. “We’ve heard a flurry of announcements so far, but most belong in the category of lip service … leaders making statements for headlines, but we all need to get into the details as that’s where the devils are,” said Harjeet Singh, senior adviser at CAN, who talked about the millions of people who have already lost their homes, land and livelihoods because of the climate breakdown causing rising sea levels, and increasingly intense droughts and floods. “We will judge Cop26 on how much rich countries stand in solidarity with vulnerable people … If there is no stream of finance agreed for people now, we will call this Cop a failure.” The UK government’s claims that this would be the most inclusive Cop in history, has come back to bite them as it seems increasingly clear that the opposite is true. For instance, environmental NGOs are allowed only four delegates into the negotiations area, even though there are six meeting rooms. “We call on the UNFCCC and presidency [UK government] to take immediate action so that the voices of those communities and indigenous peoples most impacted by climate change and climate action can be heard in the negotiating rooms,” said Sebastian Duyck from the Centre for International Environmental Law.” CAN will hold a press conference every day for the rest of Cop, to offer their views on the substance and equity - or lack of - of what’s pledged and announced by states and governments. Danny Sriskandarajah, CEO of Oxfam GB, summed it up like this: “Climate action without climate justice is technically and morally bankrupt.” Sharma press conference has finished now. Earlier, the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, pointed out the “utter hypocrisy” of Boris Johnson’s dire climate warnings and calls for immediate action at Cop26 at the same time as the UK presses ahead with a new oil field in the North Atlantic. This could be potentially interesting following the deal that South Africa struck with the UK, EU, and US for a new $8.5bn Just Energy Transition Partnership with South Africa to help reduce the country’s reliance on coal. On the issue of problems of access to the conference venue there is real anger building from campaigners with some delegates reporting that they have received messages saying the venue is full and to “phone in” to meetings from their hotel rooms. Dorothy Guerrero, a spokesperson for the COP Coalition campaign group, said: “This climate summit isn’t just the least accessible ever and a chaotic shambles, it’s grossly unjust. When so many people from the world’s most impacted countries weren’t able to make it, and delegates [who did mange to get here] are being told to ‘dial in’ from their hotel rooms - something is seriously wrong.” She said people had paid thousands of pounds to get to Glasgow, often out of their own pocket, “yet they are met with mammoth queues and told to stay away.” “This summit should have been about serious action on the climate emergency, yet once again the UK has designed a summit that quite literally excludes people from having their voices heard.” Sharma now taking questions. Asked about problems of accessibility and capacity that have dogged the first few days of the conference, he says this is a unique Cop that has had to cope with Covid, but adds he regrets logistical issues and says they are working to fix those. He adds the first two days, in which world leaders flew in from around the globe experienced particular pressure but hopes that will ease in the coming days. Sharma is speaking now. He says Cop26 has got off to a good start. He says Paris promised and Glasgow must deliver, repeating the mantra that the world must keep 1.5C of warming within reach. He pays tribute to deals on forests and methane and says vulnerable countries are at the forefront of his mind. He says he deeply regrets that the deadline for the $100bn of finance to developing countries has not been met, but says richer nations are getting closer and closer to delivering on that promise. He adds he is “cautiously optimistic” as attention turns to the detailed negotiations with “the can-do attitude” apparently shown by leaders being carried through by the negotiators. Alok Sharma, the president of Cop26 is about to speak, but while we are waiting for that to start it appears that Rishi Sunak’s plan was to come to Glasgow, make his climate finance announcement and get out again with as little scrutiny as possible. However, young activists from campaign group GND Rising had other ideas and at least managed to ask him one question: why is the UK government still giving tax breaks to fossil fuel companies? According to one of those present, the campaigners were then chucked out with officials saying the chancellor wouldn’t start his speech until they had been removed. We’re about half way through day three of Cop26. Here’s a short summary of what’s happened so far today: A newly released climate model found that new pledges made in the past few days have put the world on a pathway to 1.9C of heating above pre-industrial levels Rishi Sunak announced that London will become the world’s “first net-zero finance centre” - but environmentalists reacted with scepticism An attribution study found Europe’s record-breaking hot summer would have been virtually impossible without anthropogenic global heating I’m now handing to liveblog over to my colleague Matthew Taylor, whom you can reach at matthew.taylor@theguardian.com. Cycling and sustainable transport activists are expecting more than 700 cyclists from across Scotland to converge on Glasgow on Saturday, to join the mass demonstration planned that day to urge radical action on climate. Campaigners behind the Pedal on Parliament protests, which ride en masse through Edinburgh to the Scottish parliament each year to demand better facilities and funding for cycling, expect cyclists from as far north as Inverness and Aberdeen to join Saturday’s protests. Temporarily rebranded Pedal on Cop, the group has collaborated with local cycling campaign groups to organise eight feeder rides from towns and neighbourhoods in the Glasgow area, including Paisley and Clydebank, and 13 from towns and cities further afield. Those will include Stirling, Dundee, Dumfries, Alloa, Edinburgh, with several groups cycling through the Highlands. The Inverness, Perth, Dundee and Aberdeen contingents are planning to set off for Glasgow on Thursday and Friday; the Inverness group will ride 162 miles before joining up with cyclists from Perth in Stirling on Saturday morning. Organisers said these contingents will lead the sustainable transport bloc at the rear of Saturday’s march representing campaigners who want improved walking, safer streets and dramatically improved public transport in Scotland. My colleague Oliver Milman has taken a look at US president Joe Biden’s time at Cop26. The US was clearly piqued at how little the relentless diplomacy of John Kerry, Biden’s climate envoy, had done to extract deeper emissions cuts from leading carbon polluters. Neither Russia’s Vladimir Putin nor China’s Xi Jinping, who both offered barely improved new targets at the talks, traveled to Glasgow. Biden’s frustration bubbled over as he prepared to depart on Tuesday. Read the full piece here: Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader in Westminster, asks Johnson why the commitments from G20 nations always seem to come with a catch. He says the UK’s pledges announced on Monday come with the caveat that they will only be fulfilled if the UK economy grows as projected, and says the UK government should follow the lead of the Scottish government in making the pledges unconditional. Johnson says he agrees more needs to be done on climate finance. He says the UK is putting £11.6bn towards the $100bn annual target (but does not mention that this pledge is over five years, not one). Rayner brings up the subject of cuts to development aid, which are hampering the climate efforts of poor countries. The government has received a lot of criticism for these cuts, and representatives from developing nations have said the UK is setting a bad example to other countries as Cop26 presidents and hosts of the talks. Rayner urges the prime minister to pay attention to detail in the negotiations: “If he fails to deliver, we will all pay the price.” Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner responds (she’s in the hot seat because Keir Starmer is still isolating with Covid-19). She says everybody in parliament wants the conference to be a success, but that there is cause for concern. She says the G20 meeting at the weekend was an opportunity to apply pressure on the major polluting nations to commit to a pathway to 1.5C and to bring about a just transition, but the opportunity was not taken. Rayner says urgent action is needed, and that it is the PM’s responsibility to lead by example. She says the UK government is refusing to take the lead on coal mines even within its own borders and agreeing a trade deal with Australia that undermines key climate pledges. “Far more still needs to be done to spare humanity from catastrophic climate change,” says Johnson. He says that for some island states the negotiations are a matter of national survival. Johnson says good progress has been made at Cop26 so far, and that nations comprising 90% of the world economy are now committed to net zero, up from 30% two years ago. He rattles off various pledges that have been made at the conference so far. But he ends with a warning: “Whether we can summon the collective wisdom and will to save ourselves from an avoidable disaster still hangs in the balance,” he says. Johnson says the G20 has a special duty to act as it accounts for 80% of the world economy. He says 18 countries in the G20 have now made specific net zero commitments, and says every member at the weekend G20 meeting in Rome agreed to various measures to reduce emissions, including stopping financing for overseas coal projects. PMQs is over and UK prime minister Boris Johnson is making a statement to parliament about Cop26. “This is the moment when we must turn words into action,” he says, echoing the Queen’s words on Monday. “If we fail then Paris will have failed, and every summit going back to Rio in 1992 will have failed.” A giant image of the Queen has been displayed on the famous billboards in Piccadilly Square, London. It quotes her as saying “The time for words has now moved to the time for action”. She reportedly said this at a dinner held for world leaders attending Cop26 on Monday night, but it’s a handily reusable quote for almost any situation, should the billboard’s owners feel like keeping her up there. There’s a lively Extinction Rebellion gathering at the top of Buchanan Street, with booming drummers and this tree who has come all the way from South Wales. “Stumpy” told the Guardian he was pleased with the reforestation deal announced on Monday, but cautioned: “We’ve had so many deals and people have reneged on them and if we’re not keeping the likes of Bolsonaro accountable then there’s little point.” Barclays branches and offices across Glasgow are now plastered with “congratulations” after a new report claimed the bank has financed more fossil fuel projects than any of the UK’s largest banks in the months leading up to the climate summit. The report by climate finance campaigners at Market Forces, covered by the Guardian this week, found that Barclays financed $5.6bn (£4.1bn) for new fossil fuel projects from January 2021 to the eve of Cop26 despite growing international warnings that new fossil developments would destroy any chance of avoiding a catastrophic climate breakdown. Market Forces said the stickers are vinyl, so unlike Barclays’ fossil fuel financing they won’t cause any damage. Climate Action Network International’s daily “fossil of the day” award for countries they see as blocking climate action was shared by three countries yesterday: Norway, after new prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Norwegian gas was “not the problem, but part of the solution for a successful transition to renewable energy” Japan, after PM Fumio Kishida said fossil fuel plants were essential as part of the transition to renewables. Japan is a big coal user and plans to continue operating coal plants well beyond 2030 Australia (for the second day in a row) after they used their pavilion to host gas company Santos. My colleague Adam Morton in Australia has more on that story here. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is about to cover prime minister’s questions in the UK politics liveblog. Although it is likely to be largely about the Owen Paterson suspension vote, there are also likely to be questions about Cop26 and the government’s recent climate announcements. You can follow along here: A project aiming to preserve indigenous languages has been launched at Cop26. The Living Language Land project have released recordings of 26 words that highlight humanity’s ties to Earth. One such word is |xau from the Namibian |Xam language, defined as “to shoot with a magical arrow or go on a magical expedition”. Read about and listen to more of the words from the project in this piece by my colleague Severin Carrell: India’s pledge to reach net zero by 2070 was described as lacklustre and too late by some observers but number crunching by the University of Melbourne suggests it could be better than first thought and, taken with other recent pledges on emissions made in Glasgow, could be enough to bring the worlds emissions trajectory on a pathway below 2C for the first time. It is still far from enough to hold the world within 1.5C, the aim of Cop26, but it makes a useful difference. Researchers have run the numbers through their IPCC AR6 WG1-consistent climate emulator Magicc - which results in a best-estimate projection of a 1.9C peak warming this century. Here’s an image released by Climate Resource showing the difference: Ninawa Huni Kui, of the Huni Kui people from Acre, Brazil was outside the conference venue protesting against carbon offsetting, which he said was tearing indigenous communities apart. “They should not be deciding things without us. This Cop won’t help the climate emergency without our participation. Our land is being invaded by miners, farmers and hydroelectric companies. Our voice must be heard.” This morning sees the announcement of the winners of Cup26, described by its organisers as “football’s biggest climate tournament” (a category in which it has little competition). Over recent weeks, fans and schoolchildren supporting 49 British clubs have been competing to record as many green actions as they can, from making a bird feeder to eating a vegetarian meal to installing a smart meter. Cambridge United came top of the table, and the organisers say that as a result 1,000 football pitches in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will now be protected. Somewhere a butterfly flaps its wings, a Cambridge United fan eats a veggie burger, and in 10-15 years perhaps we can expect the emergence of the next Lomana LuaLua. There’s widespread concern that Rishi Sunak has missed the opportunity to make a real change to the way businesses and financial institutions operate when it comes to the climate and net zero. Christian Aid’s UK advocacy and policy lead, Jennifer Larbie, said: “It’s welcomed that the chancellor recognises London’s financial sector is critical to any meaningful progress towards a global net zero. But this announcement does little to shift the dial now on the trillions still flowing into fossil fuel projects every day, with the deadliest of impacts borne by developing countries. The UK government must mandate the financial sector to act with urgency to end fossil fuel investments.” But some were more positive. Kate Levick, associate director for sustainable finance at the E3G thinktank said: “This is a major step forward. To be in line with the science and 1.5C, financial regulators will have a crucial role to play in enforcing these transition plans to ensure they are credible.” But we won’t know what Sunak’s answer is to these concerns as incredibly, he’s coming to Glasgow but refusing to do a press conference or accept any questions from the media or anyone else. Hardly reassuring. Sunak has said he wants UK to be a net zero finance hub and to that end wants publicly listed companies to disclose their climate metrics . But he’s not making it mandatory to meet net zero. Why not? At this stage of a global crisis, surely it’s not too much to ask that the biggest and richest companies should be cutting their emissions. Dr Frederik Dahlmann, associate professor of sustainability at Warwick Business School said: “If the publication of these plans is not mandatory, companies will end up considering primarily public reputation benefits and commercial risk impacts from disclosure, rather than dedicate time and effort to plan their net zero strategies “Moreover, in many cases, companies’ own carbon footprints are significantly outweighed by those of their supply chains. If these transition plans don’t cover all of so-called scope 3 emissions (and ideally impose similar reporting requirements on non-listed firms), the benefits of the proposal may be insufficient to really bend the emissions curve across the UK economy as a whole. “Finally, the treasury has to explain what exactly happens with these transition plans once they have been reviewed. They may be useful for opening a wider discussion on decarbonisation within firms, but what are the consequences of failing to meet these self-imposed plans?” The UK’s longest-lasting snow patch, in the Cairngorms in central Scotland, has melted for the eighth time in the past 300 years and the third time in the past five. Found on the side of Braeriach, Scotland’s third highest mountain, the snow patch had previously melted fully in 1933, 1959, 1996, 2003, 2006, 2017 and 2018. Snow researcher Iain Cameron said: “How ironic and prescient it is that our longest-lasting patch of snow melted for the third time in five years, right on the eve of Cop26.” Libby Brooks has the full story here: “Finance is becoming a window through which ambitious climate action can deliver a sustainable future that people all over the world are demanding,” says Carney. He finishes on an optimistic note: “With GFanz, we have all the money needed for the transition. Our job is to find the plumbing to make it work.” Carney hails the rapid increase in the amount of money being managed in line with net zero targets - up from $2tn a few years ago to $130tn today. He says the new coalition of financial organisations making this commitment, the catchily-named GFanz, will be using “the most rigorous science-based scenarios” to form their plans, and that they will have to report on their progress annually. GFanz will have an advisory panel made of 20 independent experts and 7 NGOs to scrutinise the coalition’s progress, he adds. Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, is now speaking as part of the second finance session hosted by the UK presidency today. He’s also wearing a little “1.5C” badge on his lapel. He opens by reminding the audience that a few years ago the climate crisis was seen in much of the finance industry as “someone else’s problem”, whereas now almost every major financial institution is factoring in the risks of climate breakdown to their decisions. Carney says the finance industry needs to introduce rigorous climate stress testing, and the introduction of frameworks to handle stranded assets responsibly. Guardian Australia’s resident cartoonist First Dog on the Moon has summed up the first few days of the conference by following the travels of Brenda the Civil Disobedience Penguin. See the full cartoon here: Campaigners have responded critically to Rishi Sunak’s announcement that the UK will become the world’s first net-zero aligned finance centre. Charlie Kronick, senior climate adviser at Greenpeace UK, said: “This Cop demands transformative action in the financial sector but the chancellor has arrived with a marketing slogan. “The world’s first net zero aligned financial centre would be one in which financial institutions and companies are required by law at the outset to bring their lending and investments in line with the global goal to limit warming to 1.5C. Instead, these new rules seem to allow plenty of wiggle room for financial institutions to continue with business as usual, rather than ‘rewiring’ the system as the chancellor claims. “Transition pathways must be genuinely science-based, not determined by what industry participants in cosy alliances consider best practice at any given time. The chancellor is once again falling short of what the climate emergency requires.” Early this morning police officers conducted a dawn raid and seized an eight-metre long Loch Ness Monster, which was to have been released on the River Clyde. Campaigners said the monster “represents the growing threat of climate debt burdens for lower income countries, who have been prevented from discussing how debt is sabotaging their climate response at Cop26”. They say richer countries should cancel poor countries’ debt. My colleague Nina Lakhani has been spending time with indigenous groups who say they are being excluded from negotiations and that the structures of the Cop process are designed to keep power in the hands of those who already have it. In 2015, the Paris accords legally recognised the crucial role of traditional knowledge and innovations by local communities and indigenous peoples in understanding and tackling the climate crisis. The move was meant to ensure they could participate and influence international climate policies in a more meaningful and equal way. But six years on, indigenous people interviewed by the Guardian say little has changed inside the UN-led negotiations, while outside environmental destruction continues unchecked in their communities and the impact of the climate crisis is getting worse. Read the rest of her piece here: Yellen, who has now wrapped up, has been pronouncing the name of host city Glasgow to rhyme with “now”, in line with US president Joe Biden and various American TV reporters. Needless to say, Scottish Twitter has not welcomed this. Yellen says many renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives, and that the cost of many green technologies is falling rapidly, meaning it makes business sense for companies to put their money into green industry. She says it is essential to ensure the financial system is resilient to climate risks. Many fear that if there is a sudden rush away from fossil fuels by investors it could cause a financial crisis, as these assets could fall in value rapidly. For this reason, she says the US are putting a lot of resources into identifying risks and opportunities to invest in decarbonisation technologies. Yellen says a price tag can be put on the action needed, and that it’s estimated at $100-150tn. She says a lot will depend on how public finance is used to direct adaptation and mitigation domestically. She says the US is stepping up by quadrupling the level of international climate finance to more than $11bn a year by 2024. Developing countries have said that this is still lower than is needed from the world’s largest economy, especially as the US bears an outsized historical responsibility for the climate crisis. “Together we can deliver a clean resilient world. That is within our grasp,” Sharma says. Next up is Janet Yellen, the US treasury secretary. Sharma opens by talking about 1990s environmental activist Swampy, saying that while once he was a household name for his actions, “now there are Swampys all around us”. Sharma says significant progress has been made, and that the $100bn climate aid target will be met by 2023 at the latest. The original target in the 2015 Paris agreement was 2020. Sharma says many countries are raising their ambition and their pledges to developing countries. He says the private sector can be harnessed to “bring an entirely new sense of scale” and that he wants more money for adaptation, and more grants for developing countries. Sunak wraps up his short speech by urging delegates to focus on making sure the finance sector plays its part in helping the industry become sustainable. Next up, it’s Cop26 president Alok Sharma. Sunak says he hopes to “rewire the entire financial system” to put it to use to protect the climate. He says the UK will become the UK’s first ever net zero aligned financial centre. This means companies will have a mandatory duty to set out their pathway to net zero, he says. Sunak tells developing countries the G20 are stepping up and that the target of $100bn a year of climate finance for developing countries will be met, though he does not give a timeframe. The $100bn target was of the key pledges in the Paris agreement but poor countries have been critical of wealthy countries for still not having reached it six years on. It would be seen as a major coup for the UK government if the target could be hit by the end of the conference, but the total is still several billion short. Rishi Sunak has taken the stage after being introduced by a rather hectic video featuring a very loud alarm clock. “I look around this hall and I feel optimism,” says Sunak. He says it is the first Cop to bring the finance industry together with such a common purpose. “The good news is that the will is there - 80% of the world economy has committed to net zero or carbon neutrality,” he says. UK chancellor Rishi Sunak has arrived at the conference centre bearing a green version of the traditionally red Budget briefcase. He’ll be speaking shortly about the UK’s plans to move the financial system towards net zero. If you want to watch him speak, you can find a live stream here. My colleague George Monbiot has written about the need to keep fossil fuels in the ground: It really is this simple. We have the technology required to replace fossil fuels. There’s plenty of money, which is currently being squandered on the destruction of life on Earth. The transition could take place in months, if governments willed it. The only thing that stands in the way is the power of legacy industries and the people who profit from them. Read the full piece here: Welcome to the Guardian’s coverage of day 3 of the Cop26 climate conference. Overnight, we got news that hundreds of major financial institutions have committed to align their assets with a net zero target by 2050. The UK government sees this as one of the major achievements of the conference, though critics have pointed out that the pledge does not stop the investors from financing fossil fuels in the short term. UK chancellor Rishi Sunak will announce this morning that London will become the world’s “first net zero finance centre” - we’ll cover his press conference on that from about 9am. We also saw an attribution study released overnight that found Europe’s record-breaking hot summer would have been virtually impossible without anthropogenic global heating. The researchers found we can now expect similarly hot summers roughly once every three years, when before the climate crisis it would have been roughly every 10,000 years. Here’s what to expect today: 9am: Rishi Sunak gives a press conference 10.15am: Mark Carney speaks at a finance event 1.45pm: press conference hosted by the UK Cop26 presidency We’ll also keep you up to date with the various protests, pledges, discussions and other happenings around Glasgow.

The group is investing £6.3m on upgrading production at its two UK factories to produce alternatives to single-use plastic, which include recyclable paperboard as well as wraps and boxes. It said the switch would help it eliminate 850 tonnes of plastic each year – the same weight as 425 black cabs, 67 double-decker buses or 10 blue whales. This includes removing 250 tonnes of plastic rings previously used to hold packs of beer cans together (117m plastic rings in total) and 600 tonnes of shrink film, mostly used as extra packaging around trays when shipping. Part of AB InBev, the world’s biggest brewer, the group has some of the UK’s biggest beer brands in its portfolio, including Beck’s, Bud Light, Budweiser, Corona, Michelob Ultra and Stella Artois, and manufactures more than 870m cans a year. Paula Lindenberg, the president of Budweiser Brewing Group UK &amp; Ireland, said: “This announcement ensures that the UK’s favourite beers will soon come in recyclable paperboard packaging, so consumers can make better choices. We’re proud of the work we’ve already done but we realised more needed to be done to address the issue of single-use plastics.” The brewer is also switching to 100% locally sourced barley and 100% renewable electricity from solar power. It hopes the removal of plastic rings from all its UK products, including the Stella Artois pint can four-pack – the biggest selling small pack format – will have a significant impact in removing plastic from supermarket beer shelves. Plastic pack rings, known in the industry as hi-cones or yokes, are used to hold together multipacks of canned drinks, particularly beer. A standard packaging device for more than 50 years, they have become an environmental scourge by contributing to growing ocean plastic pollution and posing a threat to marine life. Last year, in a quest to find an alternative, Carlsberg announced plans to replace the rings with recyclable glue. Diageo has started phasing out plastic packaging from multipacks of its Guinness, Harp, Rockshore and Smithwick’s beers and replacing it with 100% recyclable and biodegradable cardboard packs. Last week, Coca-Cola said it was ditching plastic shrink wrap packaging used for multipack soft drink cans and replacing it with 100% recyclable cardboard across western Europe. The new cardboard multipacks will be introduced on four, six and eight packs of cans across all brands, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Dr Pepper, Fanta, Lilt and Sprite"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/dec/29/zimbabwe-christmas-poverty-dire-economic-situation-no-festivities","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-29T06:29:30Z","webTitle":"I’m home for Christmas – but hardship has sucked the spirit out of Zimbabwe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/29/zimbabwe-christmas-poverty-dire-economic-situation-no-festivities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/dec/29/zimbabwe-christmas-poverty-dire-economic-situation-no-festivities","fields":{"headline":"I’m home for Christmas – but hardship has sucked the spirit out of Zimbabwe","bodyText":"My brothers and I leapt out of bed at the first glimmer of dawn on Christmas morning – and there they were. Every Christmas of my childhood that I can remember, the shiny black school shoes were neatly lined up by the door. A new pair for all of us. Then came the new clothes proudly presented by my parents – the fruit of long hours of labour. And then, in our new finery, off we went to church. The long sunny hours of Christmas Day, usually with a brief but refreshing afternoon thunderstorm, were spent at huge family gatherings, feasting on chicken and rice, washed down with an array of brightly-coloured soft drinks – cherry plum, cream soda and Fanta orange. As the years went by and independence came to Zimbabwe, many things changed. But Christmas traditions remained much the same, with big gatherings to which people travelled many miles, new clothes, lots to eat and drink. Back in February this year, we had started planning a family reunion to be held in the Mbanga village in central Zimbabwe. With family scattered all over the world since 2000, I felt we needed to make an effort to touch base back home. I myself had been allowed to return from exile in September 2018, after Robert Mugabe had been removed from power. We set up a “Christmas in Zimbabwe” WhatsApp group, and for months excited messages flew back and forth with tips for cheap flights, recipes for traditional fare and accommodation plans. But as the year went by, things back home deteriorated significantly, with the government declaring at the end of September that foreign currency was no longer legal tender – 11 years after the US dollar became the de facto national currency! The Zimdollar was reintroduced by government directive at par with the US dollar. Within a few days, it was 10:1 and by November the rate on the street was 25:1. As December approached, it became apparent that family members abroad were sacrificing every available penny to keep those at home alive – part of the US$2bn diaspora remittances into Zimbabwe annually. Regretfully, one by one, they cancelled. I was determined to go. When I arrived in mid-December, the tales of hardship were heart-breaking. The cost of goods constantly rises, as do the prices of transport, utilities and rent. There would be no gifts for their children this year – not even new shoes. For those with a job, salaries cannot keep pace with the rampant inflation, now estimated at over 300%, as employers battle to stay afloat. As I travelled on to Harare, the main trunk road was eerily empty. At this time of year it should have been packed with traffic. But in the many small towns along the route, there was chaos. Long lines of vehicles waiting in fuel queues blocked the main thoroughfares. There were people everywhere, many of them desperately trying to sell their wares – cellphone airtime cards, wild fruits, trashy Chinese geegaws, bananas, cabbages, roasted maize cobs and bottles of water. Hundreds queued at banks and ATMs in a desperate attempt to get cash. Despite the fact that selling anything for US dollars is illegal, the government turns a blind eye to ruling party Zanu PF-connected businessmen who refuse to sell fuel for anything other than the greenback. After passing numerous queues of more than a mile in length, I was angry but grateful to get a full tank from a service station owned by a party heavyweight opposite a five-star resort in the eastern Highlands.. In Harare, I was keen to take my grandchildren to see the festive lights in the city centre’s gardens, which I had always particularly enjoyed.. But the daily 18-hour power cuts put paid to that. When the sun goes down, the city is plunged into darkness. Only the magnificent African sky, where you can almost touch the Milky Way, gives any light. Apart, of course, from those fortunate enough to have installed solar power. In the wealthier suburbs this is now common, with solar panels festooning roofs where once Father Christmases and reindeer blazed in red, green and blue fairy lights. A far cry from my 16 Christmases in exile, which had always been cold, but bright with lights of every description – from Sinterklaas in Holland to London’s Oxford Street. Even candles are too precious in Zimbabwe today to waste on Christmas decoration. They are needed to cook by, to do homework by, to polish school shoes by.

The Eden Project announced on Monday that it had secured the funding to begin drilling for clean energy next summer. Cornwall council and the European Union have provided the bulk of the £16.8m needed to launch the geothermal project, which will initially involve a well being sunk almost three miles (4.5km) into the granite crust beneath Eden. The Eden Project co-founder Sir Tim Smit said the geothermal project was the biggest leap forward for Eden since it opened in a former clay quarry near St Austell in 2001. Smit said: “Since we began, Eden has had a dream that the world should be powered by renewable energy. The sun can provide massive solar power and the wind has been harnessed by humankind for thousands of years, but because both are intermittent and battery technology cannot yet store all we need there is a gap. “We believe the answer lies beneath our feet in the heat underground that can be accessed by drilling technology that pumps water towards the centre of the Earth and brings it back up superheated to provide us with heat and electricity. “The missing piece of the jigsaw in a 24/7 clean renewable energy future is this baseload. Now we have the green light and the funding to start drilling we are determined to make this technology work.” Almost £10m has come from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) while Cornwall council has put in £1.4m and institutional investors have contributed the remaining money. The £16.8m will pay for the first phase of the project – drilling a well, a research programme and a heat main – to prove the extent of the resource. This first well will initially supply a heating system for Eden’s biomes, offices and greenhouses. It is intended to pave the way for the second phase – another well almost three miles deep and an electricity plant. Completing the second phase will mean Eden will be generating sufficient renewable energy to become carbon positive by 2023, and it aims to be able to provide heat and power for the local area. Smit said: “Geothermal will be a gamechanger for Eden, Cornwall and the UK. Once up and running, our plant will provide more than enough renewable electricity and heat for the whole site, as well as for the local area.” Guy Macpherson-Grant, managing director of EGS Energy, a geothermal development group that is working with Eden, said: “The geology in the county is particularly well-suited for cost-efficient heat and power generation, and St Austell benefits from particularly high heat flows.” Glenn Caplin, chief executive of the Cornwall &amp; Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership, added: “This is another huge step forward in the drive to create a geothermal industry in Cornwall, using our natural assets to decarbonise our economy and create high value jobs. Renewable energy is both an environmental and an economic opportunity for Cornwall.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/jan/25/race-for-seabed-threat-to-oceans","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-25T14:10:01Z","webTitle":"Race to exploit the world’s seabed set to wreak havoc on marine life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/25/race-for-seabed-threat-to-oceans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/jan/25/race-for-seabed-threat-to-oceans","fields":{"headline":"Race to exploit the world’s seabed set to wreak havoc on marine life","bodyText":"The scaly-foot snail is one of Earth’s strangest creatures. It lives more than 2,300 metres below the surface of the sea on a trio of deep-sea hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. Here it has evolved a remarkable form of protection against the crushing, grim conditions found at these Stygian depths. It grows a shell made of iron. Discovered in 1999, the multi-layered iron sulphide armour of Chrysomallon squamiferum – which measures a few centimetres in diameter – has already attracted the interest of the US defence department, whose scientists are now studying its genes in a bid to discover how it grows its own metal armour. The researchers will have to move quickly, however, for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature has just added the snail to its list of threatened species. German and Chinese industrial groups have revealed plans to explore the seabed around two of the three vents that provide homes for scaly-foot snails. Should they proceed, and mine the seabed’s veins of metals and minerals, a large chunk of the snail’s home base will be destroyed and the existence of this remarkable little creature will be threatened. “On land, we are already exploiting mineral resources to the full,” says Jean-Baptiste Jouffray, of Stockholm University. “At the same time, the need for rare elements and metals is becoming increasingly important to supply green technologies such as wind and solar power plants. “And so industrialists are looking to the seabed where it is now technologically and economically feasible to mine for minerals. Hence the arrival of threats to creatures like the scaly-foot snail.” Jouffray is the lead author of an analysis, published last week in the journal One Earth, which involved synthesising 50 years of data from shipping, drilling, aquaculture, and other marine industries and which paints an alarming picture of the impact of future exploitation of the oceans. This threat comes not just from seabed mining – which is set to expand dramatically in coming years – but from fish farming, desalination plant construction, shipping, submarine cable laying, cruise tourism and the building of offshore wind farms. This is “blue acceleration”, the term that is used by Jouffray and his co-authors to describe the recent rapid rise in marine industrialisation, a trend that has brought increasing ocean acidification, marine heating, coral reef destruction, and plastic pollution in its wake. As they state in their paper: “From the shoreline to the deep sea, the blue acceleration is already having major social and ecological consequences”. Another illustration of blue acceleration is provided by seabed grabbing, state the authors. Article 76 of the UN convention on the law of the sea (UNCLOS) allows countries to claim seabed that lies beyond the 200 miles of a nation’s exclusive economic zone. Since the first claim under Article 76 was made in 2001, 83 countries have made submissions. Put together, these claims account for more than 37 million sq km of seabed, an area more than twice the size of Russia. Many seabed grabbers include small island states that are trying to become large ocean states in the process. For example, the Cook islands in the South Pacific has claimed an area of seabed that is 1,700 times its land surface. “The extension of the continental shelf is therefore not only transforming the geopoltical landscape, it is also substantially shrinking the area designated as the common heritage of humankind,” states the report. Examples of the conflicts that could ensue because of the blue acceleration include the disruption of key fish stocks by drilling for gas or oil offshore; pipelines that prevent trawl fishing; and offshore wind farms that disturb tourism. Norway provides a stark demonstration of likely future conflicts. It aims to bring about fivefold rises both in salmon farming and cruise tourism in its waters over coming years while also building more and more offshore wind farms and more and more offshore gas and oil platforms. Seabed mining for minerals is also scheduled to begin. This saturation of ocean space renders Norwegian waters as being highly vulnerable to shocks, states the report. The South China Sea is another potential flashpoint. It is a key gateway in the region’s network of undersea telecommunication cables; a third of the world’s shipping passes through it; while half the world’s fishing boats operate in its waters – which are disputed variously by China, Malaysia, Vietnam and others. Should armed conflict break out here over any of these issues, there would be a far-reaching impact on the world’s economy. “The relevance of the ocean for humanity’s future is undisputed,” states the report. “However, addressing the diversity of claims, their impacts and their interactions, will require effective governance.” To achieve this, the authors call for greater accountability to be imposed on those financing the fundamental changes that are now being made to Earth’s oceans. These include both banks and governments. In addition, the vulnerability of small island states needs to be addressed, it adds: “Navigating the blue acceleration in a just and sustainable way requires particular emphasis on the implications of increased ocean use across the globe – and how these claims could have an impact on the economic safety and wellbeing of vulnerable communities and social groups.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/oct/11/lemon-juice-legumes-and-local-activism-what-green-habits-have-you-adopted-in-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-11T19:16:45Z","webTitle":"Lemon juice, legumes and local activism: what green habits have you adopted in 2020?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/11/lemon-juice-legumes-and-local-activism-what-green-habits-have-you-adopted-in-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/oct/11/lemon-juice-legumes-and-local-activism-what-green-habits-have-you-adopted-in-2020","fields":{"headline":"Lemon juice, legumes and local activism: what green habits have you adopted in 2020?","bodyText":"Embracing the good life with sustainable eating We started to order food from the local store for curbside pickup. We went online and bought a freezer. Bought a food vacuum sealer and ordered bulk orders from our favourite butcher and fish monger. Started to stock up on other staples. We have canned and vacuum stored fruit too. John Dorosiewicz, 65, Toronto, Canada Our biggest change has been switching from supermarket shopping to the local shops. We’re on the Isle of Man, so are dependent on UK-based supermarkets importing goods to the island to stock the shelves of their Manx branches. However, during lockdown, not only did the local Manx shops suddenly start doing home deliveries and setting up websites, but local farms and food producers began to make their goods available both as deliveries and also to island shops they didn’t previously supply. Jean Butterworth, 86, and Kate Butterworth, 53, Isle of Man We have fully committed to growing as much fruit and veg on our allotment and preserving it for the winter. We will be self sufficient in some items and we never use any pesticides. We’ll also eat less meat and far more fruit and veg. Janette Jordan, 63, Cambridgeshire, UK We used to buy most of our fruit and vegetables from a farmers’ market, but we now get a weekly box and top up from local shops – ideally independent ones. Our second source of fruit and vegetables has become local shops which previously traded as cafes, delis and small restaurants. With these sources of income closed off by Covid-19, they turned instead to selling fruit, vegetables, bread etc – items they would have bought for their original trading business. This option keeps local businesses going and hopefully will encourage some to make green grocery part of their ongoing business model. Judith Russenberger, 59, London, UK This year, my tenant (who is semi-retired) and I decided to plant as many vegetables as possible. We did a lot of digging and got some compost delivered. It was good to be outside, getting exercise and eating organically. We grew lots of lettuce and swiss chard, garlic and fava beans in the spring. Some of our summer crops have been so prolific that we have been sharing green beans, figs, apples and tomatoes with friends and neighbours. We have also taken up canning and freezing. We have also gotten to know our neighbours better because we were all around our houses more. Then, in June, my tenant and I decided to build a garden shed from scratch, using many found materials from around the neighbourhood. Kathryn Ogg, 71, Victoria, British Columbia In our neighbourhood there is a very nice street-food market where we buy our supplies for the week. The vendors are farmers from the region around, some “bio”, some not. I regularly buy milk from a farm between the woods close by where they raise cattle that have a pretty casual life on the meadows of the valley. When you bring your own bottle you can directly tap the milk from an automat in a little room where you can also buy cheese and sausages. Geertje König, 53, Bonn, Germany My main change is that I have tried to grow more vegetables in the garden. I have before grown tomatoes and runner beans and have many productive blackcurrant bushes, but this year as soon as the garden centres reopened I went out and bought some broad and french bean seeds and planted them. The french variety were disappointing but broad were OK. I am also cultivating the tomato plant that appeared in the pot where my husband and grandson planted an acorn! Margaret Elms, 70, Devon, UK When lockdown began, we built a chicken coop and run for eight chicks - soon to be hens. We are still waiting for our first eggs. Peter England, 76, British Columbia, Canada Going plastic-free Aside from avoiding meat, and anything with too much wrapping, I use vinegar and lemon juice to clean as much as possible with the least possible use of any chemical cleaners. I do not buy beauty products tested on animals and keep purchases of cleansing products down to an absolute minimum. I use cloth shopping bags and avoid using plastic bags at all cost. Finally, I will always go for the organic option if finance allows and look for fair-trade marks and other signs that the producer is considering the environment. Duffy Tomei, 66, Essex, UK I don’t use teabags which often have plastic in them. And I won’t buy sandwiches from shops using plastic-lined sandwich packaging. Caroline Quick, 77, Cambridgeshire, UK Community activism There is a weekly event on Fridays at my local church. We asked people to give a donation to church funds and expanded the range to include plants, as we had already been sharing spare seedlings and young plants using a WhatsApp group. This initiative reduced food miles and gave people access to fresh, usually organically grown, fruit and vegetables. The meeting soon flourished and became a mini social hub. Liz Little, 69, Wells, UK Amid all the chaos and uncertainty of the virus, lockdown was a blissful family time. I truly appreciated for the first time things I have taken for granted – a garden, stable family life, my health. In our local park, Miyah, my youngest daughter, provided me with a moment of total clarity that led me to question my whole way of life: I was trying to stop her picking up a plastic bottle among the litter strewn along the side of the path. She stared at me: “But we can’t leave it here, it’s bad for the animals.” It dawned on me that it really is that simple. I have always felt sad about litter, but never felt it was my job to do anything about it. I felt suddenly ashamed of that attitude and we have since become regular litter pickers in our local park. I also wrote to my MP for the first time, requesting that he support the climate and ecological emergency bill, which was recently brought to parliament and offers real hope for a better future. Talking to people on my street made me realise that many people share these feelings. We started sharing ideas, it was empowering. We have now organised a community recycling project in our street. We collect a range of plastics not accepted in our kerbside recycling collection to take to Terracycle collection points. We hope this idea might spread. Jenny Norbury, 39, Manchester, UK Saying no to fast fashion I wanted to tell you about my local Soroptimist club in Chester whose members have committed to not buying new clothes from the start of lockdown until the end of 2020. Buying from charity shops, and essential supplies (underwear!), is allowed, but otherwise we have committed to each other to try to reduce the clothes and shoes we felt we were buying unnecessarily. Geraldine Garrs, 48, Chester, UK I have been involved with climate change for a number of years, most recently spending five and a half years as chair of trustees of Operation Noah, a faith-based charity devoted to climate change. I have used the lockdown to try to reduce domestic single-use plastics even further. I have never purchased bottled water and a few years ago gave up even the very occasional spontaneous takeaway tea in favour of only ever using my reusable cup. I have not bought either hand sanitiser or disposable face masks, relying instead on hand-washing and washable cloth masks. Nicky Lyndon Bull, 66, Hertfordshire, UK Rethinking transport The biggest change we’ve made during lockdown, thanks to a Guardian article on the Money page a few Saturdays ago, is to trade in our old car for an electric car. Now we can look knowingly, but not too smugly I hope, at other electric car drivers when we come across them, rather like we look at other Guardian readers when buying our paper! Mike Smith, 66, Southampton, UK Since July 2020, I decided to share my Tesla Model 3 with our employees – our Italian physiotherapists – so they can visit their relatives without buying a car, and without using air travel. Felix Niedermann, 55, Lucerne, Switzerland Making the switch to solar power Early this year we decided to switch to a more sustainable source of heating. Our house is now heated by an air source heat pump. Wiebina Heesterman, 83, Birmingham, UK We installed a 6.4kWh solar PV system (heats the hot water, provides power through the day and exports large volumes to the grid, even in the UK!). We had the house cavity wall insulated. And we gave up a passionately loved hobby, skydiving – powered by fossil fuels unfortunately. Michael Grant, 60 and Alice Grant, 64, Hampshire, UK We have done lots of little things to help. I set the thermostat low, put on more clothes if it’s cold, have solar and hot water panels to maximise electricity production. In addition, we’ve installed triple-glazed windows to keep heat in and cold out. We also make our own elderflower cordial and of course drink tap water, never bottled water. Caroline Quick, 77, Cambridgeshire, UK A year ago I went all electric, having an air source heat pump installed and replaced the gas cooker with an induction top electric cooker. Six months ago I had a small room super-insulated inside the external walls, insulation under the floor where the boards were replaced by sheets of water resistant fibre board. These were glued together and sealed round the edges so were draught-proof. Finally, the roof insulation was topped up. It is now a warm snug little sitting room, having previously been the coldest room in the house. Nan Howitt, 80, Leeds, UK Shopping locally Lockdown meant that the money we usually spent on travel, dining out, concerts, etc built up in our bank accounts. We took a conscious decision to spend that surplus on those goods and services suffering most economic damage, buying much more online and giving work to local builders and tradesmen. John Davies, 79, and Jacqui Davies, 74, Wales, UK I’ve been trying not to buy anything, especially technology coming from “far away”. I spotted drill-bits made in Austria and saw refills made in Mannheim [Germany]! Above all I hate it when labels are missing the “made in” information. We can make anything in Europe. If I can’t find it, most likely I will buy nothing, invent something instead, sew old clothes etc. Flavio Ferlitz, 70, Austria Travelling (not) by air I live in Montreal, Canada and during April and May especially we enjoyed wonderful fresh air and quiet in our suburb. The large international airport is about 16km away and the planes don’t usually fly over our neighbourhood, so we hadn’t realised how much noise was emanating from that airport! The peace and quiet set me thinking about other airports and what noise we produced when we took flights going here and there on vacations all over the world. Even though one of our daughters and her family live in Sweden, we have decided to think twice before hopping on a plane. Diane Campbell, 74, Quebec, Canada Last year, I took 37 flights. I haven’t taken a single flight in the past six months. In short, if I can go by plane, I can also go by bus, for the vast majority of the travels I do. I hope now that 2019 was the peak of my flight fuel consumption. Anna Sawicka, 28, Vilnius, Lithuania Since the end of March, we have decided to reduce or stop completely travelling by air. We will spend holidays in this country or in places that can be reached by train. John Harris, 80, and Christine Harris, 78, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK … And a scythe of relief The footpaths near where I live traverse marshland, so quickly become overgrown. I’ve always been outdoorsy so decided to have a go at mowing with a scythe. It ticks all my boxes – it gets me outdoors into the fresh air, lets me see the wildlife not often observed – such as owls, foxes, mice, frogs, butterflies and wildflowers (which of course I mow around, allowing them to flower), it’s free exercise, provides a great sense of purpose, keeps the public footpaths clear and open, and as an ornithologist I delight in seeing the winter arrivals of geese, ducks and migrant birds.

Even Germany’s largest carmaker VW felt compelled to publicly contradict the report days after its publication, giving a rare glimpse of its own lifecycle analysis based on company-specific data that shows Volkswagen EVs are better than their diesels. Yet rather than backing down, Sinn’s now back at it in an article published by the Guardian. Rather than forcing carmakers to invest in clean technology – the EU’s current policy – Sinn proposes introducing a big fuel tax on car drivers which he believes would be more effective than forcing German carmakers to go electric. But this isn’t about Sinn. In fact, whenever you read a newspaper article claiming EVs are worse than diesel or petrol cars, that article will be based on a report that deliberately makes EVs look worse than they are. Usually the plot is as follows: a smaller petrol or diesel car is compared with a bigger, more powerful electric car; then the fossil fuel car is assumed to be as efficient as the EU’s official tests portray (in reality its fuel economy is always a lot worse); and finally the electric car is driving in a region with a very dirty electricity mix. Then you assume very high emissions for battery production based on outdated studies and finally you pretend electric cars don’t last very long and that its batteries aren’t reused or recycled. There will always be a new study with some flawed assumptions to keep us all busy and we could rebut these until we all drop. The advantage for the oil and diesel industry is that articles and reports, however poor, keep the controversy alive. Discrediting or distorting science is a political strategy, as Naomi Oreskes chronicles so well in Merchants of Doubt. So let’s skip the detailed rebuttal and just look at some basic facts. Every year we burn around 275m tonnes of petroleum and diesel in cars, vans and trucks in the EU alone. Petrol and diesel vehicles are hugely inefficient. Around 70% of the energy that goes into a car engine is wasted. Oil that is burned cannot be recovered, reused or recycled. Oil cannot be made clean. Actually, thanks to the rise of unconventional oil, it is getting dirtier. So if we want to halt global warming we need vehicles that don’t burn stuff. That’s the unique appeal of electric cars, trains and buses. They’re ultra-efficient and have no tailpipe emissions. And yes, of course, we’ll need clean electricity to run the vehicles and to produce the cars and batteries. But we know how to make power clean and we’re making rapid progress towards exactly that. The UK has almost got rid of coal, Germany is phasing it out, and even in Poland and Trump’s America, coal is in decline. Meanwhile clean wind and solar power are on the rise. By 2030 half of the EU’s electricity will come from renewables driven by renewable electricity mandates and the increasingly robust EU carbon pricing scheme. The rise of electric cars and green power are some of the biggest climate success stories of the past few years. It is the result of regulators in Europe, California and China doing their job and industry rising to the occasion. It shows what we can achieve if we set industry ambitious goals to clean up its act. That might not please some but it is fair, effective and, for the climate, unequivocally a good thing. As the Nobel prize committee eloquently put it: “Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionised our lives since they first entered the market in 1991. They have laid the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society, and are of the greatest benefit to humankind.” • William Todts is executive director of Transport &amp; Environment, a European research and campaign group"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2020/jan/04/its-a-food-forest-amazon-villagers-face-down-bolsonaro-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-04T06:00:24Z","webTitle":"'It's a food forest': Amazon villagers face down Bolsonaro threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/04/its-a-food-forest-amazon-villagers-face-down-bolsonaro-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2020/jan/04/its-a-food-forest-amazon-villagers-face-down-bolsonaro-threat","fields":{"headline":"'It's a food forest': Amazon villagers face down Bolsonaro threat","bodyText":"﻿From space, the Amazon rainforest resembles a giant dark-green lung veined with blue rivers that is steadily succumbing to the disease-like spread of grey fires, orange roads and square-cut farms. What the satellite images cannot show is how most of the remaining bands of verdant, healthy foliage are defended on the ground by forest dwellers who act as antibodies to drive out malignant invaders. Among the most impressive of these is the Tapajós-Arapiuns Extractive Reserve in the state of Para in northern Brazil, where residents are trying to bolster their economic resistance with a series of new agro-forestry and solar power projects. The 74 traditional riverine communities who live in the area fought hard to win protected status for the region, which is 110 times the size of Manhattan. Some activists were murdered by loggers and others received death threats until their home was recognised by the state as an extractive reserve in 1988. This gives them the right to live sustainably on the land, free from intrusion by large-scale business interests. Today, however, their region is once again under threat as the government of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, encourages commercial development of the Amazon. This has put greater pressure on the residents to find alternative forms of income so the forest around them is worth more than it would be if they sold up to cattle ranchers or soya farmers. Among the projects that aim to do this is a new solar-powered fruit pulping facility at Surucua village. Run as a cooperative by the largely women-led residents association, it is part-funded by Global Greengrants Fund UK, one of the Guardian and Observer’s climate emergency appeal charities. The mini-factory provides residents with an economic incentive to protect and replant the forest with a wide variety of trees that provide fruit, nuts, oil, medicine and other products they can use and sell. Surucua is idyllic. Pellucid waters lap against deserted beaches of fine white sand, bordered by palms and rubber trees. The village comprises three dirt roads, several dozen wooden homes, a school, a church, a football pitch and clusters of trees of little-known indigenous fruits such as acerola, piquia and tucumã to global favourites such as mango, pineapple and banana. “It’s a food forest,” says Mayá Schwade, a biologist who works with the community. “The basic idea is to avoid monocultures.” The new pulping centre is a small concrete building with solar panels on the roof that was built by a cooperative of 16 local women with technical support and funds from a mix of institutions and charities. Its goal is to protect the forest and raise living standards by pushing village production up the value chain. Instead of quickly selling low-cost produce before it rots, villagers can process, package and freeze fruit, allowing them to wait for the best market price. With help from Guardian and Observer readers, their next step will be to build a new facility that can turn the fruit into alcohol and cordials, jams and confectionery. “Our economy is very weak so this project is very important for us. We can make enough to feed ourselves and earn a little more to buy things,” Maria Aranjo, one of the founders of the co-op, explains. “It’s also fun to work together for a better life.” Surucua is intended as a model for other communities. If living standards in this remote village can be raised with native fruit forests and renewable power, then people living in similar conditions elsewhere in the Amazon will have hope they too can generate enough money and electricity to buy and use computers, mobile phones, TV sets and refrigerators without sacrificing the natural wealth – fresh water, abundant food, clean air – provided by the forest and river. The village hopes the small-scale project will inoculate it against the more destructive industries that are moving ever closer. “On the borders of our territory we face a lot of pressure from loggers,” says Angelo Sousa, a forest engineer who was born in the village. Pressure is also coming from the authorities, who are weakening rainforest protections. “The municipal government wants to expand production of soya and other monocultures. In the coming 10 years, they plan to allow cultivation of these crops in the [protected] reserves. The politicians are all big landowners. There is a proposal in congress to reduce the area of many reserves, including ours,” Schwade says. Elsewhere, the impact is already apparent. In the year to July, deforestation of supposedly protected areas of the Amazon – the world’s largest terrestrial carbon sink – hit 5,054 sq km, up 39% from the previous 12 months. To fortify forests against this, Brazilians are increasingly focusing on economic protections such as the project at Surucua. Rather than the destructive extraction of beef, soya or gold, the agro-forestry project at Tapajós-Arapiuns aims to strengthen the forest rather than run it into the ground.

Nominally closed to the public before 4pm each day, the grounds are a popular location for joggers, strollers and dog walkers, who enter through a gap in the fence. For Zakiya Mckenzie, a local writer, this is the furthest from home she has been in three months, but she has chosen this spot for an interview because of its historic symbolism – a subject that has has come to the fore like never before in the wake of the pandemic. She leads me down wooded slopes to a waist-high monument set in a glade, a little apart from the other tombs. It is the relocated grave of a group of Baptist people, including Fanny Coker, who was born a slave in the Caribbean island of Nevis in 1767 and died in Bristol in 1820, serving as a housemaid to one of Bristol’s wealthiest plantation-owning families. Simple, secluded and shared, the stone could hardly be more different from the elaborate statue of the slave trader Edward Colston, which held pride of place in the centre of Bristol until last month, when it was pulled down by Black Lives Matter activists and thrown into the harbour. For Mckenzie, this is part of an overdue reconsideration of the wealthy, predominantly white world’s mistreatment of other people and the environment. “This is the perfect time to discuss land and history. A lot of people are upset that Colston’s statue has been pulled down. We must discuss why,” she says. Since 2016, Mckenzie has been working as part of the Black and Green Ambassador project that aims to address the exclusion of black, working class and immigrant communities from the largely white, middle class environmental movement. She has focused on nature walks, field trips and discussions on the Ujima community radio station, while also encouraging green groups to make more space and time for different voices and a greater understanding of the global, structural cause of the climate, nature, health and inequality crises. In the wake of the lockdown there is strong public support for a fundamental rethink. A substantial majority want big or moderate changes in the way the economy is run, while only 6% are opposed to change, according to a recent YouGov survey. Prominent figures from business, unions, the bureaucracy and the church have echoed the need for a “fairer and greener” rebuilding. While there is scant recognition of the need for environmental justice at the national government level, communities have proved more adept at linking global environmental concerns with local social inequalities. Bristol has been at the centre of both the problem and the search for solutions. In the early 18th century, this city in south-west England profited from the slave trade and monoculture plantations more than anywhere else in the UK. Over centuries, the city’s merchants financed more than 2,000 voyages on a triangular trade route: first taking British manufactured goods to Africa, then cramming the hold with slaves for transport to plantations in the West Indies, and finally returning with sugar cane and cotton. The human and environmental toll continues to be felt today, but Bristol is also going further than most in trying to address the consequences. This was the first major city in Europe to directly elect a black mayor, the first in the world to declare a climate emergency and the first in the UK to be named a European green capital. There has been tension between largely white, middle class environmental activists who say the climate should come before all else, and black and working class communities who are more focused on day-to-day economic inequality. But the mayor, Marvin Rees, says the ultimate goals are aligned. “These are not separate agendas,” he said. “The climate is an issue of social justice. People hit first and hardest by the destruction of the planet look like me and my father.” Bristol has promised to go carbon neutral by 2030, which is the most ambitious target of any city in the country and 20 years ahead of the national government, but even before the pandemic it was off-track, and the lockdown has punched an £80m hole in the city’s revenues from council tax and business rates. Rees said he would be looking for savings from climate interventions and flood defences rather than frontline services, such as care homes and refuse collection. This triage of today’s crisis over tomorrow’s was reluctant. Rees wants the central government to intervene by front-loading planned investments in retrofitting homes, public transport and decarbonising the energy system. The focus, he said, should be on creating jobs in the transition to clean energy. “There is no doubt the next shock will be the climate shock. We can’t get away from that,” he said. “But we need to remember the green economy is also about housing quality, not just wind farms.” Nobody needs to tell that to the working class community of Lawrence Weston. This post-war housing estate in north-west Bristol is one of the lowest income neighbourhoods in the UK, but it has also gone further than most in marrying local social concerns with climate strategy. This is thanks to a strong community spirit, a supportive council and a nimbleness in adapting to crises. During the depths of austerity in 2012, the city threatened to close the local youth centre, so a group of residents took over the building and made it a community hub for debt advice, mental health counselling, veterinary advice, craft workshops and classes for zumba and kickboxing. During lockdown, they have repurposed the building once again as a distribution hub for food parcels and prescription deliveries. Mark Pepper, a lifelong resident who works full-time as the project development manager of Ambition Lawrence Weston, said the lockdown had strengthened the community and made people more determined to push ahead with infrastructure projects that could make them more resilient to future shocks. He says residents realise they can make money and save the planet at the same time. Helped by donors, including a lottery-funded Big Local budget and a 50% share in the profits of a solar power plant, they have hired specialist consultants to help them draw up an ambitious community action plan to build affordable, environmentally friendly housing, install new charging points for electric cars and improve cycle access. Residents – 70% of whom say they struggle to pay heating and electricity bills – can use a mobile phone app that employs thermal imaging to spot weaknesses in the energy efficiency of their homes. Local traders then fix the draughty windows and insulate the lofts, but only charge a fee to those who can afford it. “We’re doing a lot on climate, but only by accident,” Pepper says. “We used to think the climate was a middle class problem, that had nothing to do with us because we have low car ownership and few people take foreign holidays. Our residents have more pressing worries like paying the rent, heating their homes and buying enough food for their families.” But they now see it as a way of investing in the future. Later this month, Pepper – who left school with no qualifications – is expecting a response to the community’s proposal to build a £5.4m wind turbine. The planned 4.5MW tower would be erected 3km from Lawrence Weston and generate enough electricity to power 3,850 homes and generate an income for the community of between £50,000 and £400,000 a year depending on borrowing costs. “We want an economic return as well as a reduced carbon footprint. We’ll use the cash for a training academy so that residents can get good jobs in renewable technology, energy efficiency and passive building construction,” Pepper says. For him, this is a question of independence. “We hope that after Covid there is more recognition for grass-roots social infrastructure that enables us to help ourselves more,” he said. Encouraging more collective ownership may seem a thousand miles away from the government’s policies, but many believe this is key to engaging a wider community to reduce emissions, care for nature, and address prejudice and inequality. Other countries have demonstrated that this coming together of people, energy and land does not need to be a distant utopia. In Germany, nearly half of renewable energy is cooperatively owned, in France more than half the agriculture market is farmer cooperative owned, compared with 6% in the UK, and in the global south, communal forest management is more effective at carbon sequestration than government-run programmes. The poet Mckenzie is optimistic this crisis will open doors and strengthen communities. The felling of the Colston statue has inspired her to start writing again, after being blocked for the first couple of months of lockdown. She is venturing out further physically and moving campaign activities online, which makes them more accessible. The Black and Green Ambassadors project has also received a grant from the national lottery to recruit three new ambassadors and a full-time administrator. “It’s very exciting. This is our baby,” Mckenzie says. She also plans to promote the idea that well-being needs to be made more of a priority than economic growth. “The pandemic has made us realise the importance of essential workers and nature. We’re all interconnected,” she said. “We can’t just go back to business as usual. That would be to the detriment of everyone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/aug/28/mitsubishi-invests-in-uk-company-to-bring-off-grid-solar-to-asia","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-27T23:00:24Z","webTitle":"Mitsubishi invests in UK company to bring off-grid solar to Asia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/28/mitsubishi-invests-in-uk-company-to-bring-off-grid-solar-to-asia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/aug/28/mitsubishi-invests-in-uk-company-to-bring-off-grid-solar-to-asia","fields":{"headline":"Mitsubishi invests in UK company to bring off-grid solar to Asia","bodyText":"A British energy firm lighting up homes in Africa with pay-as-you-go solar power has secured £40m to extend its reach to Asia with the help of Japan’s Mitsubishi. The conglomerate has taken a stake in off-grid solar company BBOXX through the start-up’s latest funding round, which will power the Africa-focused company deeper into Asia. The funds will also help BBOXX, which operates in Rwanda, Kenya, Togo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to break into new African markets, where an estimated one in three people live without reliable access to electricity. BBOXX is one of a growing number of energy companies to plug into the demand for energy across Africa and south Asia. The falling cost of solar technology and the strength of mobile banking across Africa have encouraged major investments from global energy companies including US giant General Electric and France’s EDF and Engie. Mansoor Hamayun, BBOXX’s chief executive and co-founder, said Mitsubishi’s “extensive reach” and “technological expertise” would help the company to supply more people living without access to modern utilities and services. “The funding is further evidence of Japanese interest in Africa and in PAYG [pay as you go] solar energy globally,” he said. BBOXX and its rivals use mobile money to charge customers a monthly fee for the use of mini solar panels and ultra-efficient lighting strips. The fixed-period contracts usually run for about two years, until the equipment is paid off. Customers can then choose to keep their existing kit and use the electricity for free, or upgrade their system to include more panels and extra appliances under a new contract. Earlier this year, BBOXX sold a 50% stake in its Togo-based business to EDF Energy in return for funding to help grow the company. It operates about 270,000 solar systems, of which 200,000 are monitored remotely by software that uses machine learning to track customers’ energy use and payments. In time, BBOXX hopes to broaden its reach beyond energy to include gas, water, internet and loans. The company’s largest rival, Fenix International, supplies 500,000 homes and was snapped up by Engie in late 2017. Hamayun said: “We look forward to this next phase of growth that will help us to transform more lives, unlock potential and grow our already global footprint by opening up new markets, and develop our product range.” The funding round also included Bamboo Capital Partners, a Luxembourg-based impact investor; DOEN Participaties, a Dutch impact investment fund; and Canadian growth equity firm MacKinnon, Bennett &amp; Company."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/05/pioneering-liquid-air-project-can-help-store-excess-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T05:00:36Z","webTitle":"Pioneering 'liquid air' project can help store excess electricity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/05/pioneering-liquid-air-project-can-help-store-excess-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/05/pioneering-liquid-air-project-can-help-store-excess-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Pioneering 'liquid air' project can help store excess electricity","bodyText":"A pioneering project in north-west England will turn air into liquid for energy storage to help electricity grids cope with a growing amount of wind and solar power. The world’s first full-scale “liquid air” plant is based on a technology that advocates say is cheaper and able to provide power for longer periods than lithium-ion batteries. The demonstration scheme next to a landfill site in Bury, Greater Manchester, uses excess or off-peak electricity to chill air to -196C, transforming it to a liquid state to be stored inside large metal tanks. Pumping and heating is used later to turn it back to a gas, which is released to turn a turbine, generating electricity at times of need – but without burning the gas and releasing emissions. While relatively small at 5 megawatts (MW) compared to 50MW lithium-ion battery facilities being built by firms such as EDF Energy, Highview Power said the technology could be scaled up to hundreds of megawatts. Gareth Brett, the company’s chief executive, said the technology could timeshift energy across the day, with the firm buying electricity when cheap and releasing it when prices are higher. “If you only want to store energy for an hour, lithium-ion is fine but the reality is what people are looking to do is store excess renewable power and release it at peak times, which is usually four hours or more,” he said. Brett admitted the liquid air process is less efficient than storing electricity in batteries but pointed out that the storage does not degrade over time, as lithium-ion cells do. Highview Power is already exploring sites for a much larger, 50MW storage facility and pitches the fact it can be located anywhere as one of its selling points. The firm has opened a US office and is also eyeing export opportunities in mainland Europe and Australia. The 690-square metre Bury facility officially opens on Tuesday, funded with £8m of government money. However, Brett said the technology was ready for commercialisation and could succeed with subsidy, and the firm has raised £25m of private investment for more projects. Large-scale energy storage is seen as increasingly vital to help the National Grid and local energy networks cope with the fast-growing levels of renewables, whose output varies depending on the amount of wind and sunshine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/may/27/wednesday-briefing-tory-revolt-over-cummings-piles-pressure-on-pm","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-27T05:30:04Z","webTitle":"Wednesday briefing: Tory revolt over Cummings piles pressure on PM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/wednesday-briefing-tory-revolt-over-cummings-piles-pressure-on-pm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/may/27/wednesday-briefing-tory-revolt-over-cummings-piles-pressure-on-pm","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday briefing: Tory revolt over Cummings piles pressure on PM","bodyText":"Top story: Americas new centre of pandemic – WHO Hello, Warren Murray here with you, let’s wade into Wednesday. Boris Johnson faces a growing Tory revolt over his refusal to sack his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, for breaching lockdown rules. A junior minister has resigned and more than 30 other Conservative MPs have called for Cummings to go, many citing anger among their constituents. A further eight Tory MPs have been publicly critical of the senior aide’s actions and three said privately that he should be forced out. Johnson will be questioned about the Cummings scandal by the Commons liaison committee today. Cummings is facing questions about his claim in his press conference on Monday to have written last year about the “possible threat of coronaviruses” after it emerged that a blogpost published in March 2019 was rewritten last month to insert a reference to “Sars coronavirus”. Police have also opened an investigation into where he went, when and how many times around Durham and Barnard Castle. Regional outbreaks of coronavirus in England after rules are eased will be tackled with “local lockdowns”, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said. The ability to tighten restrictions in individual regions, he said, would be part of the NHS test, track and trace system, which is due to expand on 1 June. The Americas have emerged as the new centre of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said, as a US study forecast deaths surging in Brazil and other Latin American countries through August. The Americas have registered more than 2.4 million cases of the new coronavirus and more than 143,000 deaths from the resulting Covid-19 respiratory disease. Latin America has passed Europe and the United States in daily infections. Global deaths from coronavirus surpassed 350,000 on Wednesday with more than 5.58 million cases.

There’s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down … and here’s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak – from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Trump tweet branded fake news – Twitter has for the first time taken action against falsehoods tweeted by Donald Trump, labelling them with an exclamation mark and linking through to a comprehensive, factual takedown of his claims about mail-in voting. Twitter previously refused to censor the president’s many violations of its policies and changed its rules to exempt tweets by “world leaders”. Trump has swiftly rounded on his favourite soapbox, accusing its owners of trying to influence the US elections and political bias. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Labour’s ruling body has chosen David Evans as general secretary to replace Jennie Formby, a Corbyn loyalist who stepped down after Keir Starmer was elected leader. Evans, Starmer’s preferred choice, defeated a union candidate, Byron Taylor. &gt; A serial rapist known as the “beast of Kavos” has broken his back after Greek police chased him over a cliff. Dimitris Aspiotis, 47, was previously jailed for sexually assaulting six British women but freed because of prison overcrowding. Corfu police were pursuing him for another rape. &gt; A newborn boy delivered by emergency caesarean section at a Norwich hospital is the first in the world to undergo a trial of a cannabis-derived medicine that may protect babies who are at risk of seizures and brain injury. &gt; There have been protests in Minneapolis after a black man, George Floyd, was killed when a policeman knelt on his neck during an arrest. In New York a woman has been fired from her job after video showed her making a fraudulent call to police that a black man was harassing her. He was out birdwatching in Central Park and had asked her to leash her dog in accordance with signage. &gt; Improving the water supply in developing nations could help reduce the hundreds of billions of plastic water bottles produced each year, experts have said. People in many countries use bottled water because their piped supply is of dubious quality. * * * Hong Kong unrest – Thousands of armed police have flooded the streets of downtown Hong Kong today in an unprecedented show of force to prevent planned protests against a controversial law being debated by the territory’s legislature that would criminalise ridicule of China’s national anthem. It comes amid growing anger at the expected imposition by Beijing of “national security” laws to prevent challenge to the Communist party’s authority in Hong Kong.

Sport The controversial £300m Saudi Arabia-funded takeover of Newcastle United appears to be in serious doubt after the World Trade Organization ruled that the country is behind a pirate satellite TV and streaming service that offers illegal access to sporting events, the Guardian can reveal. The Rugby Football Union has refused to rule out funding cuts for top-flight women’s clubs after it was announced that Tyrrells will be ending its sponsorship of the Premier 15s league in August. Joshua Kimmich’s sublime chip gave Bayern Munich a 1-0 win at second-placed Borussia Dortmund in Der Klassiker as the Bundesliga leaders put one hand on the title. Expectations continue to grow over the prospective return of the Premier League before the first of two key meetings this week. The clubs are to meet via video conference this morning having taken soundings from players and coaching staff, who were briefed on a return to contact training by the league in a pair of short meetings on Tuesday. Business Investment in global energy will fall by $400bn (£324bn) this year, the biggest slump in the industry’s history, as the Covid-19 pandemic fuels a collapse in energy demand. The International Energy Agency says the decline is “staggering in both its scale and swiftness” and while it will affect every major sector, from fossil fuels to wind and solar power, it could undermine the transition to renewables just when the sector needs a rapid increase in investment. Asian markets have been mixed, with Shanghai down, along with Hong Kong, which is being roiled by protests over civic freedoms. The pound is worth $1.231 and €1.124 while at this point the FTSE is forecast to open 0.4% higher. The papers The Sun enthuses “Friends and families reunited”, saying ministers hope to let households mingle from next month. The Mail has “Housing estates will face new local lockdowns” – our version of which is here. The front of the Express alights on the story of remdesivir trials for selected Covid-19 patients, and quotes Matt Hancock hailing it as the “biggest step forward since the crisis began”. The Metro, though, gets at what the government is up to: “Hancock’s half hour”, it says, going on to say: “The attempt to save embattled adviser Dominic Cummings descended into farce as Matt Hancock promised a review of fines for parents breaking lockdown – only to be immediately slapped down by No 10”. Others still have their eye on the ball too: “Rising Tory revolt over PM’s refusal to ditch Cummings”, says the Guardian. “Farce and furious” – the Mirror scoffs at Michael Gove who said he also sometimes uses the public roads to test his eyesight (bound to reassure the pedestrians of Surrey Heath). “Public backlash over support for Cummings” says the i, reporting that the PM’s approval rating has plummeted. “PM suffers poll slump as Cummings revolt grows” and “Tories revolt as voters turn on Cummings” – the Times and the Telegraph, respectively, can’t credibly turn the page on this story either.

The EIB, the largest public bank in the world, announced this year that it would end lending to new gas projects, having already curtailed funding for coal and oil. This would free up more money for renewable energy developments. The details of the plan were expected to be confirmed by a board meeting of EU finance ministers on Tuesday but last-minute lobbying has forced a postponement. Executives of the bank, which is owned by EU member states, said the plan was still on course and would probably be approved next month. “The new energy lending policy is a milestone on the EIB’s road to transform itself into the EU Climate Bank. I am pleased about the important progress made today and am confident of securing a final approval in November,” said Andrew McDowell, the EIB vice-president responsible for energy. But climate campaigners fear the measures will be delayed further and weakened. “This delay is a direct result of Germany and the European commission pushing to add more fossil fuels back into the policy. This is the opposite of the leadership demanded by millions of climate strikers and activists around the world,” said Alex Doukas of the NGO Oil Change International. “We are in the middle of a climate emergency, so it shouldn’t be hard to say no to more public money for fossil fuels.” Between 2013-17, the EIB provided almost €12bn (£10.4bn) in loans to fossil fuel projects, almost all for gas. Supporters of the gas industry argue it is a “transition” fuel that reduces demand for higher-carbon oil and coal while providing energy security. Climate campaigners say gas projects release high levels of methane, which has a far greater greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide, and that they will delay the transition to zero-carbon renewables such as wind and solar power. The EIB says it has provided more than €65bn of new financing for renewable energy projects, but the bank’s president, Werner Hoyer, has called for more urgency. “We believe that gas emissions are too high and cannot be maintained. We must move out of these fossil fuels. We are aware it takes a transition period. We are aware that it takes help for the regions that are dependent on coal and gas. But one should not hide behind these arguments in order to perpetuate the use of these types of materials,” he said in a recent interview. EU leaders plan to describe global heating as an “existential threat”, according to a leaked copy of a summit communique, but there are divisions over the speed of action. Poland and Hungary are among a handful of countries that oppose the setting of an EU-wide zero-carbon target by 2050. Germany reportedly believes gas is necessary for energy security, at least on an interim basis as it moves away from coal and nuclear power. The clamour for urgent action is increasingly loud, spearheaded by Greta Thunberg, student climate strikers, Extinction Rebellion protesters and influential establishment voices such as David Attenborough and the Church of England. Scientists warned last year there was little over a decade to transform energy systems if the world was to have any chance of keeping global heating to a relatively safe level. Yet the world of finance continues to move in the opposite direction, particularly in the private sector. In a weeklong investigation, the Guardian revealed the world’s largest investment banks and asset management companies had aggressively expanded into new coal, oil and gas projects since the 2016 Paris climate agreement. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has warned that many of these assets will be left stranded, leading to bankruptcies and a growing risk of a global financial crash."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/dec/27/price-of-australian-thermal-coal-slumps-to-lowest-in-more-than-a-decade","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-27T08:23:37Z","webTitle":"Australian miners hit by biggest thermal coal price drop in more than a decade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/27/price-of-australian-thermal-coal-slumps-to-lowest-in-more-than-a-decade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/dec/27/price-of-australian-thermal-coal-slumps-to-lowest-in-more-than-a-decade","fields":{"headline":"Australian miners hit by biggest thermal coal price drop in more than a decade","bodyText":"Australian coal exporters have experienced the biggest annual drop in thermal coal prices in more than a decade during 2019, raising doubts about industry projections that demand will continue to grow. The spot price of thermal coal, which is burned to generate electricity, was US$66.20 ($95) last week, down more than a third from US$100.73 ($145) a year earlier. According to the government’s latest resources and energy quarterly report, it is expected to cut export earnings from the industry from last year’s record A$26bn to A$20.6bn this year and A$18.8bn next year. The drop in price came as China increased its reliance on domestic coal stocks and tightened its use of imported coal, particularly from Australia. The International Energy Agency recently found global thermal coal use declined this year after rising in 2017 and 2018, but forecast a slight increase over the next five years as rising demand from India offset a shift away from it in Europe and the US. A more detailed analysis of 2019 trends by several thinktanks found coal-fired electricity was headed for a 3% fall, the biggest drop on record after more than four decades of near-uninterrupted growth in which coal-fired power has been a primary driver of the climate crisis. The decrease has been driven by a historically sharp reduction in Europe, where demand for coal-fired power fell 23%, and the US, where it dropped 14% in the first nine months of the year despite Donald Trump’s vow that he would resurrect the local industry. In major Asian markets, where Australia sells its coal, the analysis found generation in China increased 0.5% but dipped in India due to a much smaller increase in demand for electricity than in recent years and a large monsoon boosting hydro energy. For Australian coal exporters, the biggest change has been China imposing what effectively amounted to an unannounced ban on taking their product while boosting the domestic industry as it faced a trade war with the US. Several Chinese ports restricted or delayed Australian coal imports. Tim Buckley, from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said China had constrained supply from Australia while increasing it from some producers, such as Mongolia. Beyond China’s greater emphasis on domestic production, Buckley said the fall in coal use had been driven by the rise of increasingly cheap renewable energy and liquified natural gas, a fossil fuel with about half the emissions of coal when burned but possibly more, according to some research, when extracted. He said the drop in the thermal coal price would not necessarily continue into 2020, but current trends suggested the Australian industry could not rely on demand from south and south-east Asia continuing to grow. Buckley’s assessment is at odds with that of the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), which suggested Australia’s thermal coal exports would increase 1.6% a year until 2024 as demand from India and southeast Asia grew. The IEA report, released earlier this month, thanked experts from coal companies and the Minerals Council of Australia for their input into its analysis. Matthew Canavan, the resources minister, recently told The Australian that Australia would “need more than Adani” to keep up with the expected growth in demand from developing Asian countries. He said that would likely lead to the opening of not just the Carmichael mine being developed by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, but further coal mines in Queensland’s Galilee Basin. A previous analysis by energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie found any new mines in the Galilee Basin would be expected to be in competition with existing mines in the state and New South Wales. Buckley said the IEA had repeatedly underestimated the pace of growth in renewable energy, and it was likely Asia would follow a similar pattern as Europe and the US. He gave the example of Vietnam, which had increased its installation of solar power tenfold this year, albeit off a low base. “Coal-fired power is down because it’s the highest marginal cost source of electricity in most markets,” he said. “Renewable energy is now available at scale and at lower prices. That will increasingly be the case.” The government’s resources and energy quarterly report said the collapse in the thermal coal price had created major problems for US miners, leading to seven filing for bankruptcy in the past four months. It said Australian producers had faired better due to their higher quality coal and the weaker currency, but would also be affected by market conditions. Analysts say the slump has threatened the viability of billions of dollars of coal projects. The report said prices for metallurgical coal, which is used in steel-making and accounts for around 60% of Australia’s coal export earnings, had also fallen noticeably. Buckley said China’s targeting of Australian coal appeared political, and was ongoing. “It introduced an artificial barrier to Australian coal on an ad hoc basis, saying it could not unload ships, and that intensified later in the year,” he said. Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that limiting global warming to 1.5C, a goal referenced in the Paris climate agreement, would require coal use for energy to fall 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. The Minerals Council declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/aug/27/boris-johnson-words-on-uk-battery-sector-not-matched-by-action","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-27T18:15:20Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson's words on UK battery sector 'not matched by action'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/27/boris-johnson-words-on-uk-battery-sector-not-matched-by-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/aug/27/boris-johnson-words-on-uk-battery-sector-not-matched-by-action","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson's words on UK battery sector 'not matched by action'","bodyText":"Boris Johnson’s support for Britain’s “world leading” battery sector risks being undermined by government policy, according to the industry. A coalition of trade groups and technology firms have written an open letter to the Guardian that calls for urgent changes to policies they say threaten to hold the sector back. Johnson used his first speech as prime minister in the House of Commons last month to support Britain’s burgeoning battery manufacturing industry, which he said was leading the world. However, battery makers and operators fear that a string of policy changes, such as the decision to increase VAT on home batteries from 5% to 20% from October, could scupper growth in the sector despite the increasing need to build a more flexible energy system. The Renewable Energy Association (REA) joined Beama (British Electrotechnical and Allied Manufacturers’ Association) to warn Johnson that his words now require action. “The government has set out strong ambitions for the UK to be a world leader in flexible generation … However, their rhetoric is not being matched by action,” they write. “In the last two years Ofgem has removed embedded benefits for distributed generation and storage, derated benefits for batteries in the capacity market and eliminated feed-in-tariffs for rooftop solar. Government now also plans to increase network charges and hike VAT for homeowners who invest in residential solar and storage. “If the new prime minister is serious about maximising the advantages from the shift to decentralised energy, the government must set clearer targets and a roadmap for reform of our electricity system and show greater urgency in putting in place the framework for an open market in flexible generation.” The trade groups were joined by energy storage companies, including Zenobe Energy and iBMS Solutions, which said poor policy threatened to undermine the UK battery industry. Their warning comes after an industry report found that the UK risked being left out of the European boom in home batteries because of a tax hike on solar-battery systems. The report by consultants at Wood MacKenzie predicted that Europe’s home battery capacity could rise fivefold in the next five years but the UK would lag behind owing to the British government’s “unfavourable” policies. Since then energy storage companies have called on National Grid to build a bigger backup reserve with more batteries after Britain’s biggest blackout in more than a decade. Nina Skorupska, the chief executive of the REA, said the rapid roll-out of cheap renewable energy required a global move towards smart technology to help integrate wind and solar power. “British companies are at the fore of navigating this shift and if we successfully build a thriving market for storage at home it will strengthen our hand when it comes time to export these technologies abroad,” she said. Skorupska added: “It’s an exciting time for this sector, but cuts affecting battery deployment in homes, businesses, and co-located with generations sites seriously undermine our potential global competitiveness in the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/dec/06/good-king-wenceslas-looks-out-on-a-feast-of-journalism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-06T12:00:40Z","webTitle":"Good King Wenceslas looks out on a feast of journalism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/06/good-king-wenceslas-looks-out-on-a-feast-of-journalism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/dec/06/good-king-wenceslas-looks-out-on-a-feast-of-journalism","fields":{"headline":"Good King Wenceslas looks out on a feast of journalism","bodyText":"Hello and vřelé uvítání from Prague, where we’ve come for some c̶h̶r̶i̶s̶t̶m̶a̶s̶ ̶s̶h̶o̶p̶p̶i̶n̶g̶ conference or other. It’s the Prague Media Point journalism event, neatly subtitled “What’s Working?” I’m told that media in the Czech Republic is largely controlled by creepy billionaires, is awash with fake news and is struggling to make ends meet. Sound familiar? Still, it’s always inspiring to hear that the Upside is not alone: indeed there is a vibrant ecosystem of local journalists around the world seeking out what works in their community and trying to spread the word. My own particular favourites from this week: Tea after Twelve, a Bonn-based operation which publishes in English; Outlier Media, a community self-help grapevine from Detroit; Rubryka, a promising Kiev-based startup (which is only worth clicking through to if you read Ukrainian). And perhaps boldest of all, Takie Dela, a Russian outlet that connects journalists to social problems and charities trying to fix them, in a media environment that can only be described as hostile. Prague has not deflected us from some meaty journalism this week: it’s been a big year for exploring alternative economics, outdated metrics like GDP, growth and the primacy of profits. So this week we took a look at the 20-year drive for ever lower prices and the lazy assumption that all consumers want is cheap stuff. That’s certainly not the case in France, where Jon Henley uncovered a movement determined to pay fair prices. You’d be surprised just how many French people are on board.

Here’s a link (in English). The Gas experience may be worth exploring in a future Upside article. Obviously, Italy’s different from the UK in that many people living in towns and cities still have links to villages where their ancestors came from, thereby facilitating the search for locally-sourced, organic produce. Local GAS groups that source products from areas where there have been earthquakes or other natural disasters often offer a solidarity lifeline by offering stricken producers higher prices so that they can get back on their feet again.

The event was hosted by the Thiel Foundation, established four years earlier by the arch-libertarian PayPal founder Peter Thiel to “defend and promote freedom in all its dimensions”. From behind a large lectern, Friedman – grandson of Milton Friedman, one of the most influential free-market economists of the last century – laid out his plan. He wanted to transform how and where we live, to abandon life on land and all our decrepit assumptions about the nature of society. He wanted, quite simply, to start a new city in the middle of the ocean. Friedman called it seasteading: “Homesteading the high seas,” a phrase borrowed from Wayne Gramlich, a software engineer with whom he’d founded the Seasteading Institute in 2008, helped by a $500,000 donation from Thiel. In a four-minute vision-dump, Friedman explained his rationale. Why, he asked, in one of the most advanced countries in the world, were they still using systems of government from 1787? (“If you drove a car from 1787, it would be a horse,” he pointed out.) Government, he believed, needed an upgrade, like a software update for a phone. “Let’s think of government as an industry, where countries are firms and citizens are customers!” he declared. The difficulty in starting a new form of government, said Friedman, was simply a lack of space. All the land on Earth was taken. What they needed was a new frontier, and that frontier was the ocean. “Let a thousand nations bloom on the high seas,” he proclaimed, with Maoish zeal. He wanted seasteading experiments to start as soon as possible. Within three to six years, he imagined ships being repurposed as floating medical clinics. Within 10 years, he predicted, small communities would be permanently based on platforms out at sea. In a few decades, he hoped there would be floating cities “with millions of people pioneering different ways of living together”. Politics would be rewritten. The beauty of seasteading was that it offered its inhabitants total freedom and choice. In 2017, Friedman and the “seavangelist” Joe Quirk wrote a book, Seasteading, in which they described how a seasteading community could constantly rearrange itself according to the choices of those who owned the individual floating units. (Quirk now runs the Seasteading Institute; Friedman remains chair of the board.) “Democracy,” the two men wrote, “would be upgraded to a system whereby the smallest minorities, including the individual, could vote with their houses.” In the decade following Friedman’s talk, a variety of attempts to realise his seasteading vision were all thwarted. “Seavilization,” to use his phrase, remained a fantasy. Then, in October 2020, it seemed his dream might finally come true, when three seasteading enthusiasts bought a 245-metre-long cruise ship called the Pacific Dawn. Grant Romundt, Rüdiger Koch and Chad Elwartowski planned to sail the ship to Panama, where they were based, and park it permanently off the coastline as the centrepiece of a new society trading only in cryptocurrencies. In homage to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of bitcoin’s mysterious inventor (or inventors), they renamed the ship the MS Satoshi. They hoped it would become home to people just like them: digital nomads, startup founders and early bitcoin adopters. Their vision was utopian, if your idea of utopia is a floating crypto-community in the Caribbean Sea. No longer was seasteading a futuristic ideal; it was, said Romundt, “an actual ship”. The Satoshi also offered a chance to marry two movements, of crypto-devotees and seasteaders, united by their desire for freedom – from convention, regulation, tax. Freedom from the state in all its forms. But converting a cruise ship into a new society proved more challenging than envisaged. The high seas, while appearing borderless and free, are, in fact, some of the most tightly regulated places on Earth. The cruise ship industry in particular is bound by intricate rules. As Romundt put it: “We were like, ‘This is just so hard.’” * * * As with many stories about techno-libertarian fantasies, the tale of the Satoshi begins in an all-male, quasi-frat house in San Francisco in the late 90s. Romundt – a softly spoken Canadian with the optimistic, healthy glow of someone who combines entrepreneurial success with water sports – was living with a bunch of software engineers, all of whom shared an intense dedication to personal improvement. “I was a huge Tony Robbins fan,” Romundt told me in one of several Zoom calls from his office in Panama. (Robbins’ themes of individual freedom, self-mastery and the accrual of significant wealth are evident from the titles of his books from that time: Unlimited Power; Lessons in Mastery; Unleash the Power Within; The Power to Shape Your Destiny, and, next level, Awaken the Giant Within.) After his San Francisco stint, Romundt, the son of a hairdresser, created ScissorBoy in 2009, a popular online TV series on hairdressing, and then ScheduleBox, a website which offered a digital receptionist service for hairstylists to book in their clients. (Always digitally inclined, he had, according to his website, the world’s “most advanced mobile paperless office in 1995”.) “I used to work 17 hours a day, so I didn’t have a lot of freedom,” he told me. He did, however, make enough money to semi-retire in 2016 and then spent “no more than five hours a month” running his business. The giant fully awakened, he moved back to Canada, where he lived on a houseboat on Lake Ontario and went kayaking in the mornings as the sun came up. Enraptured by his lifestyle, Romundt wondered why everyone wasn’t living this way. On a flight one day, he saw a man wearing a T-shirt with “Stop arguing. Start seasteading” printed on it. Romundt was curious, they got talking, and the man turned out to be Joe Quirk, who was by this time running the Seasteading Institute. So far, the Seasteading Institute had experienced variable, or zero, success with its projects. Early ideas for a “Baystead” and “Coaststead” off the coast of San Francisco and a “Clubstead”, a resort off the coast of California, never made the leap to reality. An attempt to create a floating island prototype in French Polynesia in 2017 met with fairly fierce resistance from the people of French Polynesia and collapsed a year later when the government pulled out of the scheme. After meeting Quirk, Romundt decided he wanted to try again. Quirk introduced him to two other aspiring seasteaders, the passionately libertarian American Elwartowski and the bitcoin-wealthy German engineer Koch. Together, the trio founded a company, Ocean Builders. Using their own money, they funded the first attempt at a single residential seastead, in the form of a floating white octagonal box 12 nautical miles off the coast of Thailand. Elwartowski and his girlfriend, Nadia Summergirl, lived there for two months in early 2018, until the Thai government discovered the seastead’s existence and declared it a threat to the country’s independence, possibly punishable by life imprisonment or death. Elwartowski and Summergirl had to flee the country before the Thai navy dispatched three ships to dismantle the floating box. The seasteading movement did not die there. In 2019, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski moved their company to Panama, where they had found a government willing to back their next project: the SeaPod. These would be individual floating homes held 3 metres above the water by a single column and a tripod-shaped base beneath the ocean. The man responsible for their design, Koen Olthuis, is a Dutch “aquatect”, an architect specialising in water-based schemes. In rendered drawings, the SeaPods look fantastical, like a giant’s white helmet emerging monstrously from the waves. Inside, every surface is curved, as if you were living within the smooth, colourless confines of a peppermint. Romundt compared the SeaPods to the architecture in The Jetsons, the 60s cartoon where the characters lived in glassy orbs in the sky. “It’s like that,” he told me, “but on water.” The team built a factory from scratch in Linton Bay, a marina on the north coast of Panama, hired a team of about 30 engineers and mechanics, and, in early 2020, began building the first SeaPod prototype. Progress was slow. Even once they had a successful prototype, Romundt predicted the factory would only make two SeaPods a month. They’d had the idea before of buying a cruise ship – a quick way of scaling up the community – but the cost had always been prohibitive. By autumn 2020, though, the situation had changed. Like many parts of the travel industry, the cruise ship business was collapsing because of the pandemic: multiple cruise lines were going into administration, empty ships filling up ports like abandoned cars in a scrubby field, or being sent to the scrapyard. Cruise ships, the Ocean Builders trio realised, would be going cheap. Sure enough, they found a bargain. In October 2020, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski bought the ex-P&amp;O cruise ship Pacific Dawn for a reported $9.5m. (Built in 1991 for $280m, the ship could have sold pre-pandemic for more than $100m, one industry insider told me.) They instructed Olthuis to draw up the plans, placing the ship at the heart of a floating community surrounded by SeaPods. “We had a kind of funny idea,” Olthuis told me. In his scheme, the Satoshi would connect, via two looping tunnels on the water, to human-made floating platforms designated for agriculture, manufacturing and parkland. From the air, the whole community would form the shape of the bitcoin B. The scheme had the support of the Panama government. In fact, the Ministry of Tourism hoped that a new ocean community would be a draw for visitors. In a page-long statement, the ministry told me how a floating development fitted in with its Sustainable Tourism Masterplan 2020-2025, by highlighting the country’s biodiversity and “the blue heritage of Panama”. It didn’t seem to mind the idea of a load of crypto-investors floating off their coastline, not paying any tax. * * * “Out of adversity comes opportunity, so they say,” wrote Elwartowski, on 10 October 2020, introducing Viva Vivas, the new company that he had created to run the Satoshi. Its name was adapted from the Latin phrase, “vive ut vivas”, meaning “live so that you may live”. Ten days later, he announced the venture on Reddit: “So, I am buying a cruise ship and naming it MS Satoshi … AMA.” The responses were quick (“Need an apprentice aviation mechanic?” “I know how to use a yo-yo! Any room for me??”) and included the inevitable sceptics. (“Anyone remember the good old days of the Fyre festival?”) But plenty took the proposition seriously and wanted to go over the small print. (“Where is power coming from? Gas? Internet? Food? Water? Toiletries? What taxes will she be subject to?”) Elwartowski answered every question with grave attention to detail. There would be generators at first, followed quickly by solar power. This would be an eco-friendly crypto-ship. High-speed wireless internet would come from land; utilities would be included in the fees at first, but would be metered when the systems were upgraded: “You don’t want to have pay for someone else’s mining rig in their cabin,” he wrote, referring to the resource-intensive computational process that introduces new crypto “coins” into the system. As for tax, you would not pay any on earnings made from ventures based in territory beyond Panama. You would be free to make, or mine, as much money as you liked. It would be a remote worker’s regulatory paradise. But as the Reddit Q&amp;A continued, Elwartowski’s meticulous responses revealed some of the more knotty practicalities of life on board. It turned out that the only cooking facilities would be in the restaurant. For safety reasons, no one was allowed to have a microwave in their rooms – though some cabins had mini-fridges, noted Elwartowski, determinedly sidestepping the point. He offered residents a 20% discount at the restaurant and mentioned that some interested cruisers had already talked about renting part of the restaurant kitchen so they could make their own food. “We want entrepreneurs to come up with solutions and try them out,” he wrote, in a valiant attempt to convert a fairly fundamental stumbling block into wild startup energy. “This is your place to try new things.” Not all the Redditors were convinced. “No microwave but mining rig. Incoherent scam.” Marketing of the Satoshi soon began in earnest. Her 777 cabins were to be auctioned off between 5 and 28 November, while the ship was crossing the Atlantic towards Panama. Viva Vivas listed the options, including cabins with no windows ($570 a month), an ocean view ($629), or a balcony ($719). Ocean Builders held a series of live video calls for potential customers which attracted 200 people at a time, Olthuis told me, with Romundt, an expert steward of the multilateral video call, at the helm. On the Viva Vivas website, a Frequently Asked Questions page covered the basics of the cabin auction process, fees and logistics. Specially trained staff would be hired to keep the ship Covid-free and through a partnership with a platform called coinpayments.net, multiple cryptocurrencies would be supported for payment, including bitcoin, ethereum, digibyte, bitcoin cash, litecoin, dai, dash, ethereum classic, trueUSD, USD coin, tether, bitcoin SV, electroneum, cloak, doge, eureka coin, xem and monero. The final entry on the FAQ page, regarding the possibility of having pets on board, gave a bracing insight into the tension between the idea of freedom and the reality of hundreds of people closely cohabiting on a cruise ship. The answer linked to a separate document, containing a 14-point list of conditions including one that declared no animal should exceed 20lbs in weight, and any barking or loud noises could not last for longer than 10 minutes. If a pet repeatedly disturbed the peace – more than three times a month or five times in a year – it would no longer be allowed to live on board. “Any pet related conflict,” instructed point 13, “shall be resolved in accordance with Section V (F) of the Satoshi Purchase Agreement or Section IV (F) of the Satoshi Master Lease, where applicable.” Dogs would only be permitted in balcony cabins, and it was advised that owners buy a specific brand of “porch potty”, a basket of fake grass where your pet could relieve itself. (Pet waste thrown overboard would result in a $200 fine.) One Reddit respondent – maxcoiner on Reddit, Luke Parker in real life – was as close to the target market of the Satoshi as it was possible to imagine. A longtime follower of the seasteading movement, he was also such an early and successful bitcoin adopter that he and his wife were able to retire early thanks to their investments. The Satoshi was the most plausible idea for a seastead he’d ever heard. “I did not buy a room during the Satoshi’s sale window,” he told me over email, “but it was hard to keep my hand off that button.” A variety of considerations held him back. “The wife,” as he put it, had her doubts. He wasn’t sure about the “ginormous leap down in luxury” from living in deep residential comfort on land in the US midwest to living in a very small cabin on board a 30-year-old cruise ship. He was worried, too, by the limited facilities – “No kitchen of my own? Tiny bathrooms? Tiny everything?” Also, the constant rocking of the ship on the water: “I just can’t stomach that life around the clock.” He preferred the idea of the SeaPods. If Parker was going to live on a boat, he concluded, he’d prefer to buy his own luxury catamaran. On 29 November, Elwartowski published another post on the Viva Vivas website, announcing the official opening of the Satoshi in January 2021. “This will be a new experience for all of us so we must manage your expectations,” he warned. The novelty was too much for Parker. “It takes a rare kind of person indeed to move your life on to a deserted cruise ship in Central America with so little information up front,” he told me. If Parker, part of that highly select, freedom-seeking, system-abandoning, overlapping community of seasteaders and bitcoiners, wasn’t going to buy, it was hard to imagine who would. As he put it: “This may have been the smallest sales demographic in history.” * * * Over 30 years of service, the Satoshi herself had seen enough of the world to know every permutation of life at sea – apart, perhaps from what it might be like to be a permanent home to 2,000 crypto-investors. Built in 1991 in the Fincantieri shipyard in Trieste, Italy, she is one of only two cruise ships designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. (The other, the Crown Princess, was sent to the scrapyard last year, a Covid casualty.) Her first incarnation was as the Regal Princess (owned by Princess Cruises), after which she became the Pacific Dawn (P&amp;O Australia). Throughout her life, she has been admired for her distinctive features: a domed roof rising above the navigation bridge, water slides that curl round her funnel and a stern whose elegantly rounded form is in marked contrast to the blunt, sawn-off rears of some giant cruise liners. Those who prefer an understated cruising experience also appreciate her discreet size: compared to the largest cruise ship in the world, The Symphony of the Seas (18 decks, 23 swimming pools) she is a modest vessel (11 decks, two swimming pools). For many years, the Pacific Dawn cruised the south Pacific, enjoying a serene phase of life, interrupted only by an onboard swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the time she lost power and came within 70 metres of crashing into the Gateway Bridge on the Brisbane River. In 2011, a devoted Facebook group was established by fans. “Dawnie was the party ship,” remembered one. “I fell in love with my wife all over again,” added another, crediting the ship for his romantic renewal. Then, in 2020, it briefly looked as though Dawnie was set to join her sister on the scrapyard, after her sale to British cruise company, Cruise and Maritime Voyages, collapsed in the pandemic. Her fans were grief-stricken, weeping emojis piling up on the Facebook group. (“Well 2020 just became even shittier,” said Kathie.) When it was revealed that the ship had been rescued by Ocean Builders, there was a wave of relief, if a little mystification at her new name. “She’ll always be Dawn to me.” On 29 October 2020, Dawn began her journey to Panama, sailing from Limassol, Cyprus to Piraeus, Greece. A week later, she was handed over to her new owners Ocean Builders and officially became the Satoshi. Koch flew over from Panama to cross the Atlantic aboard their new purchase. The team hired a management company, Columbia Cruise Services, to run the ship and provide a minimum crew of about 40 people, mostly Ukrainian, including a cook, engineers and cleaning staff. A seasoned British cruise captain, Peter Harris, arrived to take charge. “We didn’t know anything about running a cruise,” Romundt told me, “so it was like, we didn’t want to have to figure all this stuff out.” As soon as Capt Harris joined the ship and met Koch on board, he realised there would be challenges ahead. “I was thinking a week into the job, I can see I’m going to be resigning,” Harris told me, immaculate in a striped shirt on a video call from his home in Kent. Koch, he said, was admirable in his ambition, and a likable, law-abiding man, but he was naive about how shipping worked and had an abhorrence of rules. “He didn’t understand the industry,” said Harris, who has the frank, upbeat air of a born leader for whom hierarchy is a kind of creed. “He just thought he could treat it like his own yacht.” To sail anywhere, Harris explained, a ship requires certificates of seaworthiness. These expired on the day the deal with P&amp;O was completed. Usually, a new buyer would ensure they lasted a couple of months to cover any onward journey, but no one on the Ocean Builders side had checked. By the time Columbia Cruise Services came on board and informed the team of the situation, the contracts had all been signed. Before the Satoshi could cross the Atlantic, the team were obliged to sail the ship to Gibraltar and have her removed from the water, a process known as dry-docking, to perform essential repairs and renew the certificates. The Atlantic crossing began on 3 December. Harris – who didn’t resign, grateful for the four-month contract mid-pandemic – found it oddly lovely. With only 40 or so people on board, rather than the usual 2,000-odd, the atmosphere was relaxed, if a little surreal. Among other things, P&amp;O had left about 5,000 bottles of wine and 2,000 bottles of spirits on board. Harris asked Koch if he wanted to charge the crew for drinks, but Koch, generous by nature, said no. “Obviously, we restricted them to three drinks a day,” said Harris. “Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had a crew.” * * * As the crossing continued, questions about how the project would actually work once the Satoshi arrived in Panama grew more pressing. According to Harris, Elwartowski thought he could convince the Panamanian authorities to let the ship anchor permanently in its waters and de-register as a ship, becoming a floating residence instead, so as to avoid some of the more exacting requirements of maritime law. But while Panama was happy to have the ship moored off its coast, it specified that the ship had to remain officially designated as a ship. Which led to another difficulty: the discharge of sewage. Though the ship had an advanced wastewater management system, which could turn sewage into drinking-quality water, they were not permitted to discharge this wastewater into Panamanian waters, and so would have had to sail 12 miles out every 20 days or so to empty tanks into international waters. Such obstacles made the ship an off-putting proposition for insurers. No one would agree to cover them. “They wouldn’t even tell us why we weren’t insurable, they just kept saying no,” Romundt said. “It’s kind of hard to remedy something if you don’t know what the problem is.” Of the several insurance experts I asked about this, none were willing to comment on the case, citing a lack of expertise, presumably because no one had ever tried to insure a cruise ship turned floating crypto-community before. Harris, however, had his theories: that a risk-averse insurance industry was wary of both a bitcoin business and a ship that would presumably be mostly populated by quick-to-litigate Americans. After trying multiple insurers and brokers, Romundt began to realise that the cruise ship industry was, as he put it, “plagued by over-regulation”. (Along with airlines and nuclear power, according to Harris, it’s in “the top three”.) The Ocean Builders’ great freedom project, whose intrinsic purpose was to offer an escape from oppressive rules and bureaucracy, was being hobbled by oppressive rules and bureaucracy. As Elwartowski would reflect a few months later on Reddit: “A cruise ship is not very good for people who want to be free.” To Romundt, the whole cruise ship business began to seem like an impenetrable old boys’ network. He estimated that, given six months, they could have hired a crack marine legal team and navigated a way through the loopholes. But by mid-December, the Satoshi was already halfway across the Atlantic, burning through gallons of diesel, with a 40-person crew they’d have to keep on board even when she was stationary in Panama because a cruise ship requires constant maintenance. A ship can cost, even when docked, up to $1m a month to run. “Because, you know,” said Romundt, “it’s huge.” Fuel alone was costing the Ocean Builders trio about $12,000 a day. According to Harris, Koch wanted to try to make the ship more fuel-efficient by installing a smaller engine, which he thought he could do while the ship was at anchor. “We were like, how are you going to cut a hole in the ship’s side big enough to get the engine out, which is below water level, and not sink the ship?” Harris shook his head, his memories of Koch clearly fond, if perplexed. “I was forever saying, ‘No, Rudi you can’t do this; no, Rudi you can’t do that.’” Before the Satoshi hove into view of the white sands of a Panama beach, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski had to make a call. They couldn’t afford to keep the ship moored and empty for months on end while they tried to solve the insurance problem, a problem they weren’t even sure they’d be able to solve. They were insured to sail her, and they could go on sailing her, but they didn’t want to run a travel company. They wanted to run a floating society of like-minded freedom-lovers arranged in the shape of the bitcoin B. It wasn’t even clear that there were enough people who wanted to do that. Koch admitted to Harris that the cabins weren’t selling. “It was almost like a fantasy, James Bond-ish,” said one cruise industry insider. “But to their credit they believed in it.” * * * The dream was over, they realised, before it had even begun. The project was dead, except it wasn’t quite, as they still owned the ship, which was still steaming across the Atlantic with Koch, Harris and the crew on board. The Satoshi, already thousands of miles into a 5,500-nautical-mile voyage, had travelled too far to be turned around mid-ocean, so on she sailed. They’d have to sell her, the Ocean Builders realised, but who was going to be crazy enough to buy a cruise ship in the middle of a pandemic? Only a company who wanted to tear her apart. On 18 December, while she was still at sea, the team announced the sale of the Satoshi to a scrapyard in Alang, India. The Satoshi was once again destined for dismemberment. On 19 December, Elwartowski announced on the Viva Vivas website that the Satoshi’s journey was coming to an end. “We have lost this round. The New Normal, Great Reset gains another victim,” he wrote, looping in the collapse of the Satoshi with a popular Covid conspiracy theory that the pandemic and its response had been stage-managed by a global elite. (Over subsequent months, Elwartowski’s activity on Reddit would include other Covid themes, including suspicion of government vaccination programmes.) Romundt emailed their list of potential customers to let them know the ship’s fate. Deposits for cabins would be refunded. The Satoshi arrived in Balboa, Panama on 22 December. On Christmas Eve, she anchored off the coast of Colon. There, Romundt joined Koch and the crew on the ship. Elwartowski, meanwhile, stayed in Panama City. “He didn’t want to get on board,” said Romundt. Koch spoke to Joe Quirk one evening on the phone while he was sitting in the ship’s cafe drinking a bottle of wine, feeling regretful that the onboard hospital he’d planned to open to medical entrepreneurs would never come to life. Even so, Koch was “utterly unbowed”, reported Quirk in a Seasteading Institute blog post entitled How the Grinch Stole the Cruise Ship. Romundt, a man more driven by the practical issues at hand than the romantic symbolism of his endeavours, realised that, though the entire plan had fallen apart, he was still the part-owner of a massive cruise ship. He decided to spend Christmas on board, along with the crew. Master key in hand, he wandered around the Satoshi, making sure to enter every room that said Do Not Enter. He toured the engine room, and sat on the sun deck. He worked, because he can’t help working, even at Christmas, but he also went on all the water slides, alone. (Harris told me he’d turned them on specially for Christmas Day.) Though Romundt doesn’t usually drink, he had a glass of wine and called all his friends saying, “I’m on my own cruise ship for Christmas!” He had the kind of good time it is perhaps only possible to have when you have just made an unbelievably expensive mistake born of a desire to invent an entirely new way of living and involving the purchase of a huge floating vessel. “I was king of the ship!” he said, still delighted. * * * Even scrapping the Satoshi proved to be a debacle. After a deal had been done with the Indian scrapyard, the Ocean Builders team realised that according to the Basel Convention, which covers the disposal of hazardous waste, they weren’t allowed to send the ship from a signatory country (Panama) to a non-signatory country (India). The contract with the scrapyard had to be cancelled. All was not completely lost, at least for the Satoshi herself. The cruise ship industry is a compact ecosystem. The grapevine did its thing. A ship broker heard about the plight of the Satoshi, realised it was precisely the kind of ship a new client of his was looking for, and did a quick deal. The client was Ambassador Cruise Line, the first British cruise company to launch for 10 years. According to Ambassador’s ebullient, red-sweatered chair, Gordon Wilson, the company’s name is intended to reflect the highly optimistic idea that ambassadors, like cruise ships, take the best of their own culture with them wherever they go. The Satoshi would be the first ship in the company’s new fleet, which would offer cruises to the over-50s. Many of the new team at Ambassador had come over from Cruise and Maritime Voyages, who had nearly bought the Satoshi before it went bust in 2020. As such, they knew the ship well, which sped up the sale. Wilson wouldn’t confirm the amount – “they thought it was a good price” – but the trade press reported that Ocean Builders sold her for $12m, more than they paid for her, though possibly not quite enough to cover the elaborate costs of running an empty cruise ship for three months. On 23 February 2021, the Satoshi set sail from Panama, heading all the way back across the ocean she’d just crossed. She arrived in Bar, Montenegro on 27 March. Wilson went over to visit her, and, like Romundt, relished the experience of climbing aboard his new asset. Exploring the engine rooms of an empty cruise ship seemed to give these men a particular sensation: perhaps just the buzz of owning something so vast and powerful; a mechanical, proprietary thrill. The Ocean Builders team, meanwhile, returned to their own private missions. Elwartowski was on sabbatical, Romundt told me. He did not want to talk to me for this story. Koch, who also declined to be interviewed, was building his own boat in Panama, and working with Romundt on the SeaPods. Over Zoom, Romundt gave me a tour of the SeaPod factory, and showed off the hulking sheets of fibreglass that would form the structure’s mould. “It feels like touching a UFO,” he said, stroking his invention. Seeing the pod’s nascent form, I felt a boringly pragmatic urge to ask Romundt what happened if, once afloat, you needed to buy a pint of milk. My question seemed to miss the point, too wedded to old-fashioned notions of locality and human connection. The Pods had been designed to have a hatch in the roof, Romundt said. He was talking to some drone creators and imagined people flying to their pods independently, landing on the roof and entering through the hatch. Perhaps that’s how you’d get your milk. At her new home in Montenegro, meanwhile, the Satoshi needed some sprucing up. For the fourth time in her three decades on the water, she had been renamed. “We thought Ambience a lovely name for a ship,” said Wilson, pronouncing it in the French style, Ambi-ence. “This is a very elegant ship,” he added, proudly. “She looks like a cruise liner; she does not look like a floating block of flats.” When Ambience finally sets sail on her maiden voyage, from the industrial dock of Tilbury across the North Sea to Hamburg in April 2022, she will offer a more traditional experience to her passengers. “Back to what cruising is all about,” said Wilson. The atmosphere will be refined. There will be promenading on deck and plentiful opportunities for photography as the horizon swallows the evening sun. There will be cocktails at the bar, a five-course dinner and a glittery show. It is unlikely bitcoin will be accepted as currency. The water slides will be removed. • This article was amended on 8 September 2021 to include the full name of Ambassador Cruise Line, and to clarify that the Ambience’s dinners will have five courses, not three. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/04/solar-power-renewables-international-energy-agency","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T07:00:22Z","webTitle":"Time to shine: Solar power is fastest-growing source of new energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/04/solar-power-renewables-international-energy-agency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/04/solar-power-renewables-international-energy-agency","fields":{"headline":"Time to shine: Solar power is fastest-growing source of new energy","bodyText":"Solar power was the fastest-growing source of new energy worldwide last year, outstripping the growth in all other forms of power generation for the first time and leading experts to hail a “new era”. Renewable energy accounted for two-thirds of new power added to the world’s grids in 2016, the International Energy Agency said, but the group found solar was the technology that shone brightest. New solar capacity even overtook the net growth in coal, previously the biggest new source of power generation. The shift was driven by falling prices and government policies, particularly in China, which accounted for almost half the solar panels installed. The Paris-based IEA predicted that solar would dominate future growth, with global capacity in five years’ time expected to be greater than the current combined total power capacity of India and Japan. Dr Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “What we are witnessing is the birth of a new era in solar photovoltaics [PV]. We expect that solar PV capacity growth will be higher than any other renewable technology up to 2022.” The authority, which is funded by 28 member governments, admitted it had previously underestimated the speed at which green energy was growing. The amount of renewable energy capacity forecast globally in 2022 has been revised upwards on last year’s forecast, driven by the IEA expecting a third more solar in China and India. While China dominates the expansion of renewables, the US is still the second fastest-growing market despite Donald Trump’s pledge to revive coal and the uncertainties he has brought at a federal level. Paolo Frankl, head of the renewable energy division at the IEA, said that solar and wind subsidies and other fundamentals meant the president’s impact would probably be limited. However, that could change if there were reforms that retrospectively hit the subsidies or if the US International Trade Commission imposes tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. “There is a risk, but at the moment our forecast remains strong,” said Frankl. India is set for a solar boom over the next five years, as bottlenecks such as integrating solar farms with the grid are overcome. The country’s renewable energy capacity is forecast to double by 2022, overtaking the EU on growth. The picture for the UK is a “mixed message,” said Frankl. The IEA has revised downward its forecast for the amount of green energy to be built in the UK between 2017 and 2022, with offshore windfarms expected to account for most of the growth. Despite the recent opening of the UK’s first subsidy-free solar farm, the prospects for British solar are fairly gloomy: the amount of solar forecast to be installed by 2022 is a fifth of the amount installed over the last five years. The report found that renewables are becoming increasingly comparable to fossil fuels on price, with wind and solar projects setting record low prices in government auctions. “Renewables may well become even cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives [over the next five years]. However, be careful because this does not automatically mean they are competitive and investment will flow. That depends on the risk of investment and whether remuneration flows make a project bankable or not,” said Frankl. The growth in renewable power will be twice as large as gas and coal combined over the next five years, the IEA said. While that will take renewables’ share of electricity generation from 24% last year to 30% in 2022, coal will still be the biggest source of power. The increasing scale of wind and solar power, and their intermittent nature at a local level, means that integrating them with power grids has become critical, the IEA said. Countries will need to bring forward policies that make grids more flexible, such as batteries and managing demand at peak times, it suggested. One energy expert said that the IEA report was, if anything, underestimating the speed of renewables’ growth and the impact of them becoming so cheap. Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at Australia-based analysts IEEFA, said: “2016 was another record high year of renewable installs and unexpectedly large renewable energy cost deflation, again highlighting the IEA’s continued underestimation of both these two trends driving the increasingly global market transformation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/oct/24/australias-emissions-to-start-falling-thanks-to-renewables-boom-researchers-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-23T17:00:40Z","webTitle":"Australia's emissions to start falling thanks to renewables boom, researchers say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/24/australias-emissions-to-start-falling-thanks-to-renewables-boom-researchers-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/oct/24/australias-emissions-to-start-falling-thanks-to-renewables-boom-researchers-say","fields":{"headline":"Australia's emissions to start falling thanks to renewables boom, researchers say","bodyText":"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions will stop rising and gradually start to fall over the next three years as the country feels the effects of the recent renewable energy boom, engineering researchers say. Academics from the Australian National University estimate national emissions will dip by 3%-4% by 2022, ending the year-on-year increases recorded since the abolition of the carbon price scheme. But they found deeper emissions cuts through the 2020s to meet the target set under the Paris climate agreement would depend on the federal and, to a lesser extent, state governments supporting further expansion of solar and wind by ensuring adequate new electricity transmission and storage. Andrew Blakers, a professor of engineering, said a policy briefing published on Thursday, co-authored with colleague Matthew Stocks, was a “message of hope” about reducing pollution at lowest cost. “Solar and wind energy offers the cheapest way to make deep cuts in emissions because of their low and continually falling cost,” he said. “If the renewable energy pipeline is stopped or slowed because of insufficient transmission and storage, then emissions may rise again from 2022.” While the call for improved transmission is near universal, Blakers and Stocks differ from most energy experts in placing relatively little weight on the need for government policy to continue to drive what has been a surge in clean energy investment since 2017. The current boom is largely driven by the 2020 federal renewable energy target. It led to nearly 3.5 gigawatts of capacity being built last year, three times more than the year before. But the target, equivalent to about 23% of national electricity demand, has now been met, the Morrison government has not replaced it and there is evidence investment has slowed. A growing number of businesses have signed renewable energy contracts independent of government support, but many analysts say the boom is unlikely to continue without a policy with bipartisan political support to drive the transformation to a cleaner grid. Blakers said clean technology was so cheap that adequate government support for transmission and storage would be enough to deliver 50% renewable energy by 2024 and 75% by 2030. He said a national energy and emissions policy could lead to an even faster shift, but the change will happen regardless. According to his analysis, Australia would meet its 2030 target set at Paris (a 26-28% cut in emissions compared with 2005 levels) without relying on controversial “carry-over credits” through cuts in emissions from electricity generation alone, even if emissions continued to rise across the rest of the economy, as projected. He believes the target should be increased. “I think a lot of people are hooked up on energy policy but we’re doing very well as things stand. A neutral policy is enough to make it,” he said. This contrasts with other analyses, including government projections, that found Australia was not likely to meet its emissions target under existing policies. Bill Hare, of research and science organisation Climate Analytics, said Blakers’ assessment of what it would take to meet the Paris target did not stack up. Dylan McConnell, from the Australian-German Climate and Energy College, said Blakers was right to highlight the need for support for improved transmission but disagreed that renewable energy growth would continue at recent levels without policy backing. He said investors were unlikely to sign contracts for new energy plants when wholesale energy prices were falling to zero during sunny periods. “Unless we have growing electricity demand, a coal exit or a policy ... to encourage renewable energy I can’t see it happening,” McConnell said. Tristan Edis, from consultancy Green Energy Markets, earlier this year found clean energy would provide 35% of Australia’s total electricity needs within two years as solar power transformed the national energy market. But he said the pace was unlikely to continue as things stand. “We don’t see the economics of the energy market supporting significant levels of investment in large-scale wind and solar beyond this year without some sort of reward for greenhouse gas abatement.” Blakers and Stocks recommend the establishment of renewable energy zones to overcome outdated transmission rules and significantly expanding interconnection between states, including the mooted second undersea cable between Tasmania and Victoria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/oct/21/tory-boasts-on-climate-action-are-full-of-hot-air","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-21T16:41:46Z","webTitle":"Tory boasts on climate action are full of hot air | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/21/tory-boasts-on-climate-action-are-full-of-hot-air","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/oct/21/tory-boasts-on-climate-action-are-full-of-hot-air","fields":{"headline":"Tory boasts on climate action are full of hot air","bodyText":"The letter from Conservative MPs listing their climate achievements makes rather sad reading (Letters, 17 October). Yes, they have done some positive things but the letter glosses over many problems. The record investment in renewables and phase-out of coal power stations is largely a result of market forces because green measures have become much cheaper, and it was the Labour government that introduced the feed-in tariff leading to the huge growth in solar power. Setting a net-zero target is meaningless unless supported by action, and hosting the 2020 UN climate talks will probably simply produce more hot air than reduce CO2 . It was the Conservatives who stopped onshore wind turbine installations, failed to act on the tidal barrage, and have locked us into a bad nuclear plant deal that will cost us three times as much for their power as that provided by renewables. It was the Conservatives who took away subsidies for plug-in hybrid cars and raised their vehicle tax to £140 per annum. Their flattening of the tax bands has led to a rise in sales of larger cars, and a 2040 target for ending diesel and petrol car sales is too late. I also seem to remember, many years ago, that it was the Conservatives who, in the face of building industry lobbying, failed to implement proposed regulations that would have mandated much higher insulation standards. Words are useless, only action counts in countering global heating. Michael Miller Sheffield • “The UK plans to lead the world’s future climate ambitions” (Rise of renewables may see off oil firms decades earlier than they think, 14 October) is a false claim shared by the Conservative and Labour parties, as it relies on completely blocking out the emissions that UK corporations are responsible for overseas, which are actually increasing. The UK hosts two of the world’s top five privately-owned oil majors, and three of the top seven mining corporations. Richard Heede’s research (Report, 10 October) shows that the CO2 equivalent emissions from these companies’ products alone is five times greater than all emissions in the UK. It is time for the political establishment to admit this truth and confront the consequences. Dr Andy Higginbottom Associate professor, Kingston University • The Guardian is to be congratulated on its investigatory series on the major polluters. However, in the analysis of MPs’ voting record on bills to combat climate change (Tories five times more likely than other MPs to vote against bills to tackle climate crisis, 12 October), both Jeremy Corbyn and Caroline Lucas are marked as 92% supportive on the basis they voted to “keep nuclear power subsidies relatively low”. This clearly implies that voting for higher nuclear subsidies would increase their score on lowering carbon emissions. Nadhim Zahawi, the business and energy minister, compounded this view, telling parliament in a written statement on 17 October: “Nuclear … will continue to play an important role as we transition to a carbon neutral economy.” But it is a demonstrably false viewpoint. A recent assessment of greenhouse gas emissions from differing power generation technologies by Prof Mark Jacobson indicates that nuclear CO2 emissions are between 10 to 18 times greater than those from renewables. In a newly completed chapter, Evaluation of Nuclear Power as a Proposed Solution to Global Warming, Air Pollution, and Energy Security, in his forthcoming book, 100% Clean, Renewable Energy and Storage for Everything, Jacobson argues: “There is no such thing as a zero- or close to zero-emission nuclear power plant. Even existing plants emit due to the continuous mining and refining of uranium needed for the plant. Overall emissions from new nuclear are 78 to 178g of CO2/kWH, not close to 0.” All MPs need to take note.

That’s what he calls the gawkers who pull up outside to take pictures. “I’ve had to lock the gates,” he says. In fact you’d have to be quite the shipping container boffin to identify them in some of the elaborate homes that they’re being fashioned into these days. Market Watch projects the use of shipping containers in homes will have a global compound annual growth rate of 6.5% from 2019 to 2025. In Australia, Facebook groups such as Aussie Shipping Container Homes and Shipping Container Homes Australia have sprung up, serving as wells of shared information. In her report A New Kind of Cocoon: Mapping the Home of Tomorrow, futurist and trend-spotter Faith Popcorn identifies a kind of dwelling that’s small, part-time and transient, reflecting our digital nomadism. But while single-unit shipping containers can serve as tiny homes, movable from one site to another, many builders are thinking more ambitiously. Wright got the idea for his home from watching Grand Designs. “I thought, that’s pretty cool,” he says, “and then about four years ago I had a bad leg injury in a crane accident, which made me think ‘You’re only here once,’ so I decided to try and build one myself. I drew some sketches and made a cardboard model.” Three years of weekend building with his father and he has a five-bedroom house outside Geelong. Wright hired a private surveyor because he was worried Geelong council might view his plans with suspicion. He brought an engineer on board and contracted various tradespeople. He took a welding course and his father took care of the timber work. Inside, like a normal house, it has timber walls to hold plaster. “Wherever you cut a window out you have to build a steel frame for it, because once you cut the walls they fall apart like paper bags,” he says. Similarly, even though shipping containers are designed to be stacked, once you cut holes for windows and doors you need extra struts if you want a second floor. He didn’t paint the outside because he likes the look of containers: “The shipping numbers are still on them. A lot of people clad the outside, but if you’re going to do that you should have just built a house.” His containers were new and cost $6,000 each, but he reckons they’ve gone up substantially since then. The roof is a 150ml sandwich panel, which cost him $40,000. “Without counting labour I’m at a touch over $300,000 on this house,” he says. “With labour it would have been at least $450,000. I’m sure it’s still cheaper than a new build, but not substantially. Two or three containers on a bush block would be more economical and you could do so much with them. But once you start stepping into nine shipping containers it starts to get pretty expensive.” ‘People said you’re mad’ Over in Castlemaine, Victoria, Louise Moysey is adamant that in her case a new build would have been far cheaper. “People said you’re mad, it’s going to cost a lot – you’re much better to get a prefab house. But it wasn’t about money,” she says. Moysey studied design at RMIT and started a building business with her husband Ross, Moysey and Daughters. Her shipping-container home is the 27th house she’s built or adapted for herself, and by far the most solid. You feel as though you could batten down the hatches and weather a storm. “There’s some feeling of emotional safety in here,” she agrees. She enjoys the idea of being the next port of call for the containers, and there are nautical touches here and there – a tow rope, shells, an anchor. “I love the fact that they’ve been off and had a life. I’ve lived on boats and I love looking out on the ocean.” Similarly she’s given a second life to the finishings. The huge kitchen bench is a piece of timber from a drapery workroom and the side is smoothed from where workers once leaned against it. The floor of the main room is from a bowling alley, and elsewhere there are pieces of a basketball court and remnants of the container’s original floor. Dividing walls, made out of old doors, are slideable, so that rooms can be cordoned off or made open-plan. Moysey kept the industrial look of the containers, though she painted over their bright colours. She picked out the high-cube containers herself, walking around the yard of Lockbox in Melbourne, avoiding any that had dings, rust or had transported chemicals. Once she’d transported them to her property, she in-filled between them and floated a skillion roof on top like a parasol, since a shipping container is like a steel hot box. She dropped all the ceilings 250mm to put in as much insulation as she could. It’s convenient that containers only need small concrete pads to sit the corner points on, but to meet the building regulations Moysey had to raise the containers 400mm off the ground to allow airflow under the building. A nine-kilowatt solar system on the roof powers the heat pump for her hot water. She’s got a split system, but has barely used it because the bank of louvres on the north side of the house can be opened up, so at night she can put the fans on and suck cooler air in. Her one concession to buying something fully formed was the backyard pool. But, of course, it’s built into a shipping container. ‘It’s not that affordable as yet’ As for commercial ventures, retail has caught on fast: there’s the double-decker shipping-container pop-up mall Boxpark, in London’s Shoreditch, and Pop Brixton south of the river. Re:START Container mall was built in Christchurch after the earthquake of 2011, and survived for seven years by becoming a tourist attraction. Closer to home there’s Eat Street Market in Brisbane. Then there’s budget accommodation: as far back as 2010, Canberra’s Australian National University opened a residential block made from shipping containers. In Victoria, until May, shipping containers repurposed as luxury eco-pod hotel rooms are doing the rounds of vineyards as Wine Down Pop Up. They’re the project of Toly Mezhov and Irene Polo, working as Contained, and have a bathroom, timber flooring and bedrooms that can be extended when the container is dropped into location. Mezhov likes the way shipping containers are versatile and easy to move around. Plus people tend to be fascinated by them. “We started going down the path of container homes,” he says, “but realised that it’s not that affordable as yet, because by the time you start working on something bespoke the price point is not dissimilar to building a home in situ, so we switched up our model and went down the path of pop-up restaurants, bars and hotel rooms.” Mezhov says that the reduction of embodied carbon in this kind of build, combined with using off-grid infrastructure, results in dwellings that are effectively carbon neutral. They’ve collaborated with Black Stump Technologies, which has another container holding a solar power generator, so the hotel is off-grid. They serve as a nice taster for those tempted to take the plunge. Until building solutions for working with steel containers become more accessible to the general public, the reality of shipping-container homes may realistically be limited to environmental enthusiasts intent on recycling. Although Lego fetishists may also be tempted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/jul/23/this-builder-used-to-be-sceptical-about-green-homes-now-hes-a-convert","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-22T17:30:20Z","webTitle":"This builder used to be sceptical about green homes.

Now he’s a convert","bodyText":"Tony O’Connell used to build whatever was put in front of him. The 53-year-old from Wonthaggi, a coastal town in Gippsland, Victoria, has been in construction for 34 years. “What was on the plan was what was on the plan,” he says. “I wouldn’t question it.” That is, until he attended a meeting for a proposed development in the area – one of a number of locals gearing up to run the interlopers out of town. “We all went along thinking, yep, it’s going to be a greenwash and just someone else doing a cookie-cutter development to cut our lovely little town up,” O’Connell says. But he left thinking they might have a point. More than a decade on, that development is The Cape, one of Australia’s leading eco-villages, in the nearby town of Cape Paterson. And O’Connell is one of a growing number of builders trying to improve Australian houses. Now, when a plan lands in front of him, he’s the first to point out how it could improve, coaxing homeowners into making small changes that he calls “two percenters”. A window shifted to a different wall, a patch of concrete floor that soaks up the winter sun – these tweaks can make a big difference. “I get a lot of irate calls from architects,” says O’Connell. According to Trivess Moore, a senior lecturer and researcher into sustainable housing at RMIT, builders – and plumbers, electricians, people who sell appliances and others – are “critical intermediaries” in delivering sustainable housing. Most people build new homes or do renovations rarely, Moore says, which leaves them reliant on tradies for information. “Quite often it might be that someone is recommended to you, ‘Oh, my friend used that builder, I’ll trust whatever they say,’” he says. “[The ideal is] when you do have builders who are going the extra mile, and also going ‘If this was my house, this is what I’d want for a better outcome.’” But green builders have a lot of work ahead of them. Building better houses from scratch is one thing. Improving Australia’s dismal existing housing is another. The national building code currently requires new houses to have a six-star energy-efficiency rating. The majority of houses built before 2005 have ratings between 1.5 and two. “They’re pretty shocking,” says Alan Pears, a senior industry fellow at RMIT who has been working in housing policy since the early 1980s. “[Problems with] windows, the building fabric, poorly insulated, poorly shaded and the houses leak like sieves.” O’Connell says many older homes are so leaky, the air in the house changes over about 15 times each hour. As well, they are full of inefficient appliances, spanning from hot water systems to fridges to lightbulbs to televisions. It all adds up – and exacerbates inequality. People on lower incomes are more likely to be living in older and poorer quality homes, and then either cannot afford or are not in control of upgrades. According to Kellie Caught, senior advisor on climate and energy at the Australian Council of Social Services, low-income households spend 6.4% of their income on energy bills, against a national average of 2.4% and just 1.5% for high-income households. Poor quality housing is also detrimental to people’s health, a factor likely to worsen as the climate crisis unfolds. “We’ve got a lot of people who in winter are suffering from cold,” O’Connell says. “And in summer, we have a higher death toll from people living in heat who can’t afford air conditioning than we do out of bushfires.” There are ways to make older homes more efficient, but some are harder than others. It’s easy enough to put insulation in ceilings and sometimes under floors, to replace lightbulbs with LEDs, and to plug gaps to keep out the cold and heat. Other changes, like upgrading to double-glazed windows, putting insulation into the walls, and buying better appliances can be costly, difficult or both. The poor standard of Australian buildings has prompted calls for a nationwide efficiency drive as part of federal and state coronavirus stimulus spending, which would also help tackle the climate crisis. About a quarter of national emissions are from buildings. The Australian Council of Social Service and the Australian Industry Group are among those to have urged the Morrison government to support an efficiency and solar power package for low-income and social housing, finding it could create 60,000 jobs. The chief scientist, Alan Finkel, has also highlighted the benefits of fixing the country’s leaky buildings, as have groups representing business, the energy industry, the property sector, unions and major investors. Beyond Zero Emissions, a climate change thinktank, analysed what it would take to transform Australia’s building sector as part of what it calls a “million jobs plan”. It found there would be about 200,000 jobs in a five-year program to perform 2.5m “deep energy retrofits” on existing homes and construct 150,000 7.5 star-rated social houses. Separately, researchers from the Australian National University set out to test how Covid-19 stimulus spending could have lasting economic value, cut emissions and improve people’s lives. They found energy retrofits, particular for low-income households, ticked all boxes. “You can just get the dollars out the door and into the community really quickly,” says Prof Frank Jotzo, director of ANU’s Centre for Climate and Energy Policy. “It would be a much better investment economically, socially and environmentally than the Homebuilder program, which is paying money to people who already have a project under way.” Advocates are clear that a nationwide housing overhaul is needed. But it just hasn’t happened. “We’ve been talking about regulating upgrading of older buildings since the 1980s,” Pears says, breaking into resigned laughter, “and we haven’t done it. “I think it’s fair to say there is a lack of will and leadership to drive this because it is tricky.” In the early 2010s, Heidi Lee was the project manager of Beyond Zero Emissions’ ambitious plan to retrofit every single building in Australia. “If you committed to doing it wholesale, it’s much cheaper,” Lee, now the project lead on BZE’s “million jobs plan”, explains. But when it comes to upgrading inefficient homes, you have to spend money to save it, and lots of Australians don’t have the cash sitting around. Another big weak point is the rental market. “The landlord would have to spend the money to upgrade the building and the tenant is the one getting comfortable and having lower bills,” Pears says. “Why would a landlord do that?” One way around this, and a major solution to unlocking mass retrofits, Lee says, is the expansion of environmental upgrade agreements across Australia. Under these agreements, owners can get low-interest loans that cover the upfront cost of energy retrofits and are paid back through council rates. Such schemes are currently available in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, but only for commercial buildings. Victoria recently passed legislation to extend the schemes to homes. The space is still developing, Lee says, but could be extended to social housing. “We see upgrade agreements as a key plan for a green recovery, particularly coming out of Covid,” says Scott Bocskay, CEO of Sustainable Fund Australia. Bocskay says there are a number of other energy-saving schemes and incentives out there – for instance, Solar Victoria offers interest free loans for solar panels – but generally the approach is “fragmented”. Another option for prompting retrofits, Moore and Pears suggest, is putting a minimum energy-efficiency standard on houses that are put up for lease or sale. The Australian Capital Territory intends to introduce such a law for rental properties in 2021. “That’s a way of using the market to lift the bottom, but it also means if you choose not to sell your house for 10 or 15 years or whatever it might be, you don’t have to worry about that,” Moore says. “It doesn’t force everyone to make the change right now but it ensures that over time there is that lifting of standards.” There’s also the question of how to gain public momentum. People building new homes are often pushing for sustainability in the long term, but decision-making for renters tends to be more multifaceted. Plus, a house’s energy performance isn’t exactly visible. “It’s pretty hard to tell if there’s insulation in the walls. A lot of people don’t even know which way the house is facing,” Pears says. “And look, to be honest, most Australians have never lived in a decent house in terms of energy performance. We’ve all grown up in 50- or 20-year-old buildings that are pretty awful, and we don’t even know what a good building is until we live in it.” There’s no doubt homes being built in Australia today are better than those constructed last century. But experts and builders say the six-star requirement is already out of date, and leaves Australia in Europe’s dust. “While that may have been a big step 10 years ago, now six stars is so easy to achieve for a builder,” O’Connell says. “We’re building a lot of homes at the moment that people can’t afford to live in through extremes of temperature. We’re not planning for the future.” If you design a house well enough, O’Connell says, you can get to six stars with single-glaze windows and no insulation. Add a bit of insulation, and it rises to seven or eight. These are the kinds of dwellings he is working on at Cape Paterson, which he sees as a benchmark for better housing in Australia. “If you get the design right, it doesn’t cost a lot of money to build sustainable,” O’Connell says. “It’s when you don’t get the design right and you try to get your energy ratings by putting increasingly more expensive product in to try and achieve the rating, that it does cost a bit.” There are hopes the 2022 revisions to the National Construction Code will see the minimum standard for new homes and significant renovations lifted to seven stars. O’Connell delivers talks to other builders and to councils about building more sustainable homes. Change is slow, he says, but happening. “I think if you went back 10 years ago and talked about sustainable construction, people would think you were proposing to build an igloo somewhere,” he says. Now, people are starting to see sustainability as a long-term benefit instead of a drain on their bank accounts. “It’s hip pocket. They get their quarterly power bill, they know how much it’s costing, you demonstrate how little it can cost,” he says. “I think the thinking has changed now, where people are considering a lot of these things to be a benefit rather than a cost.” The coronavirus pandemic has devastated the economy but also presented a unique opportunity: to invest in climate action that creates jobs and stimulates investment, before it’s too late. The Green Recovery features talk to people on the frontline of Australia’s potential green recovery."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/jul/19/can-a-hydrogen-boom-fuel-a-green-recovery-for-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-19T07:07:43Z","webTitle":"Can a hydrogen  boom fuel a green recovery for Britain?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/19/can-a-hydrogen-boom-fuel-a-green-recovery-for-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/jul/19/can-a-hydrogen-boom-fuel-a-green-recovery-for-britain","fields":{"headline":"Can a hydrogen  boom fuel a green recovery for Britain?","bodyText":"At the entrance to Saltend Chemicals Park, on the outskirts of Hull, there is a small blue heritage-style plaque, placed there four years ago by the Royal Society of Chemistry. It proudly commemorates: “100 years of innovation in supplying the UK with transportation fuels and important base chemicals.” A sense of pride in Saltend’s past is understandable: places like this helped drive Britain’s industrial age. But the biggest, most dramatic innovation of all may be yet to come. This month, the Norwegian energy company, Equinor, (formerly Statoil), unveiled proposals to install the biggest facility in the world for making hydrogen from natural gas, using capture and storage technology to extract and bury the resulting carbon under the North Sea. The Humber region is currently the biggest emitter of carbon in Britain and the second-highest emitter in Europe. Equinor’s plan, if it goes ahead, would amount to a green revolution at Saltend, allowing businesses on the site to convert to clean energy. And if the rest of the region follows suit, by 2030 this windblown stretch of North Sea coastline could conceivably be one of the world’s leading green energy hubs. “This is a plan,” suggests Al Cook, the head of Equinor’s English operations, “which would help transform the UK’s largest industrial cluster into its greenest cluster. We are one of the largest energy producers in the world. Saltend is one of the oldest industrial hubs of its kind. Humberside has all the natural resources required on its doorstep. It is a chance for the UK to get on the front foot in the green energy race.” Get ready for Britain’s hydrogen boom? Definitely maybe. Hydrogen has been the next big thing for longer than its advocates would care to remember. Before Elon Musk, Tesla and electric battery technology, it was commonly assumed that we might all, one day, be driving hydrogen cars. The traditional drawback for investors has been the expensive complexity of actually producing the stuff. But in an era of net zero carbon emissions targets, the green utility of the most common chemical element in the universe is turning it into one of the most fashionable products on earth. “Blue” hydrogen – the kind Equinor hopes to produce in Hull – can be made almost carbon-free from natural gas, by using the capture and storage technology. For groups such as Friends of the Earth, “almost” is not good enough, and the enormous cost of capture and storage has also generated scepticism. Green hydrogen, on the other hand, which is made from renewable sources, bypasses fossil fuels altogether. Both types can be stored and kept in reserve, to be deployed as an inter-seasonal fuel supplementing wind and solar power. Hydrogen, its supporters claim, can also heat homes and workplaces, distributed through the existing infrastructure of the National Grid. It can be used to de-carbonise trains and buses and provide green fuel for heavy-duty vehicles, for which electric-battery technology is impractical. In synthetic form, hydrogen could even help fly zero-carbon planes. All of which led the European Union’s green deal supremo, Frans Timmermans, to tweet this month: “Hydrogen rocks, and I am committed to making it a success.” Presenting an EU strategy aimed at producing 10 million tonnes of H2 by 2030, Timmermans said: “The new hydrogen economy can be a growth engine to help overcome the economic damage caused by Covid-19.” Germany has announced a massive £9bn investment plan. Peter Altmaier, the German minister for economic affairs and energy, explained the logic: “In adopting the hydrogen strategy, we are paving the way for Germany to become the world leader in the field of hydrogen technologies.” In Britain’s energy sector, as other countries invest in the hope of a virtuous cycle of green growth, there is a growing nervousness. Having led the way in early wind farm technology, the UK failed to capitalise and become a major manufacturer and exporter. In the electric car industry, it has fallen far behind Germany and other competitors after failing to invest enough in battery production capacity. Equinor has made it clear that it will only proceed with its blue hydrogen plans for Hull if the government plays its part, sharing the risks of investing in a fledgling industry. “All our experience,” says Cook, “tells us that in projects of this scale and ambition, it only works when governments and companies work together. We will need clear frameworks and assurances and a commitment to investment from London.” Julia King, Baroness Brown of Cambridge, is the deputy chair of the Committee on Climate Change, and one of the country’s most influential backers of hydrogen. She believes that if Britain acts decisively now, it can take a giant step towards meeting the legal requirement for net zero emissions by 2050 and become a world leader in a lucrative new market. “It is urgent for the UK to get on with this,” said King. “In terms of hydrogen technology, we have a very strong position at the moment. In electrolysis, in storage technology and other areas, we have really dynamic companies which we need to help grow.” Britain also enjoys a natural advantage, she points out: the winds that blow in from the North Sea and can be turned into green hydrogen. “This country has the best offshore wind resource in Europe. We have all the ingredients to make this an industry which the UK is really successful at; one which will reduce our emissions and which will provide real export opportunities for cutting-edge technologies. “We could also be selling into a huge export market for hydrogen. We could even get to the position of being sellers of electrolytic hydrogen to Germany.” None of this is likely to happen, though, without significant government intervention, both to lend confidence and to help shape an industry which, at the moment, barely exists. “The challenge is that we’ve actually got to create both supply and demand,” says King. “There’s no point in producing hydrogen unless you have a way of using it. And there’s no point in developing buses, trains and so on unless somebody is going to be able to supply hydrogen to you. “We need the government to form something like a hydrogen industry council to bring the demand and supply side players together to discuss how to start the industry. And, obviously, it would be helpful to know that there would be money available. When I was on the board of the green investment bank, one of the things we saw was the confidence that government gave when it came to investing in early offshore wind. Having government as the lead investor brings in other investors.” Conservative governments are generally averse to a hands-on approach to industrial strategy. With hydrogen, it might be different. Potentially, this is a red wall success story in the making. As King points out: “A successful hydrogen strategy would not be about jobs in Oxford, Cambridge and London. It would be about developing the regions where we bring energy from wind onshore; about places like Hull and Grimsby and all the other places along the coast that have had a really rough time and are in desperate need of an uplift.” After Equinor unveiled its proposals for Saltend, the headline in the Hull Daily Mail read: “Humber hydrogen plant could create 5,000 jobs.” Further up the north-east coast, the Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, Ben Houchen, has led a successful bid for a £1.3m grant to build refuelling stations for hydrogen vehicles. Following last December’s unprecedented string of victories in Labour strongholds, Conservative MPs are now installed in five of the eight seats in the Tees Valley. Houchen has called for the region to be turned into a UK hydrogen powerhouse. The new network of influence is making its presence felt in parliament. One of the refuelling stations will be in Redcar, a seat won for the first time for the Conservatives last December by Jacob Young. Young is the chair of the cross-party MPs working group on hydrogen which was set up in 2018. Alexander Stafford, the MP for Rother Valley – where the Battle of Orgreave took place during the miners’ strike – is another hydrogen advocate. “It would be a great thing,” said Stafford, who sits on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, “if the areas which played such a big part in energy production in the industrial age could now play a new role in producing the energy of the future.” In its latest report, the group calls for the government to urgently set out a national hydrogen strategy, “or risk falling behind”. Given the huge lead enjoyed by countries such as Germany and Japan in electric battery production, says Stafford, “if you are looking to invest, it is far better to look in the direction of hydrogen than at batteries. The whole world is heading towards becoming carbon neutral, with some countries moving quicker than others. So the question is, how can the UK get on the front foot with hydrogen? If it can do so, there will be enormous dividends.” According to King, positive signals have come from the minister for business, energy and industrial strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng. King is hopeful that a strategy will be unveiled before parliament goes into recess at the end of July. “There’s much more agreement now about where hydrogen will play a role,” she says. “In the past, it started out mainly being about light-duty vehicles. It is understood now that hydrogen is about trains, buses, industrial processes and so on.” The stakes could scarcely be higher. Given its lacklustre performance in wind and batteries, if Britain is to emerge from the Covid-19 crisis into a meaningful green recovery that generates growth, hydrogen could be key. The Committee for Climate Change has estimated that a developed hydrogen system could eventually contribute a similar amount of energy to the UK economy as the electricity industry does today. The EU envisions 25% of energy coming from hydrogen by 2050. As governments take the plunge, private investors are placing their bets. The share price of the Sheffield firm, ITM Power, which produces green hydrogen technology, has risen by 1,500% in just over a year. In places like Hull, the green future can’t come soon enough. A few days after Equinor made its pitch on Saltend, a Social Market Foundation study placed the city at the top of the list of places that will find it hardest to bounce back from the economic crisis caused by Covid-19. Mike Ross, now a Lib Dem councillor, came to the city 20 years ago as a student. He has banged the drum for green investment in Hull for years. “We became the forgotten city of the floods in 2007. Then there was the crash, and then 10 years of austerity which hit places like this hardest. After Covid, there must be a special effort. This city must not be forgotten about again.” If Hull really does become a vanguard city in a hydrogen revolution, it won’t be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2017/dec/14/in-10-years-time-trains-could-solar-powered","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T07:00:25Z","webTitle":"In 10 years' time trains could be solar powered","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2017/dec/14/in-10-years-time-trains-could-solar-powered","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2017/dec/14/in-10-years-time-trains-could-solar-powered","fields":{"headline":"In 10 years' time trains could be solar powered","bodyText":"Last week, my 10:10 colleague Leo Murray co-authored a new report on solar-powered trains with Nathaniel Bottrell, an electrical engineer at Imperial College. It’s exciting stuff. We think solar could power 20% of the Merseyrail network in Liverpool, as well as 15% of commuter routes in Kent, Sussex and Wessex. There’s scope for solar trams in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Nottingham, London and Manchester too, and there’s no reason it should just be a British thing either. We’re especially excited about possibilities in San Francisco, Mexico City, India and Spain, but trains and trams all over the world could be running on sun in a few years time. It’s also a genuine world first. There are a few solar stations – Blackfriars Bridge being by far the coolest – and some trains in India even have solar panels on their roofs, but that’s just to power equipment like lights and fans. No one’s moving the trains themselves with solar. Yet. What’s especially interesting is how our new innovation came about – in particular the role community energy groups have played in its development (often despite policy support, not because of it, or in response to policy constraints). Looking ahead, there are also important questions to be asked about what role these community groups might play in its deployment. The idea came from a community solar group in Balcombe, West Sussex, formed in response to the first anti-fracking protests in the UK, in the summer of 2013. After the drillers, the activists, the press and various other hangers-on had left, the villagers were left with a question our current energy system lets most of us ignore: how should we power ourselves? They decided they wanted local, community-owned energy, and also that they wanted to go solar. Looking into places to site a solar farm, they initially found the local grid didn’t have the capacity to take more solar. Searching for a way to solve that problem, they looked at the local railway and asked an engineering professor who happened to live locally, “could we plug it there, instead?” His answer was yes, they could, but the technical challenges to get there were a bit too much for a small-scale community group to grapple with. So they found another nearby solar site that could plug into the grid. But when solar cuts hit the UK in 2015, we dug out the idea. What had been a possible local solution to Balcombe’s grid capacity issues a while back could build into a larger opportunity for renewable energy everywhere. Community energy shouldn’t have had to innovate at that point – renewable energy tech’s pretty great as it is – but with the solar cuts so deep, and onshore wind effectively banned in England, the solar trains idea gave us options. So 10:10 teamed up Energy Futures Lab at Imperial College London, umbrella group Community Energy South, and electrical engineering specialists Turbo Power Systems to find out more under Innovate UK’s Energy Game Changers competition. Looking ahead, it will be a few years yet before we’re able to deploy the tech necessary to plug solar into trains. It needs building, and it needs testing, but I’d be shocked if it doesn’t happen. What’s less clear is whether community groups will be involved as solar railways roll out. As they’ve been part of this from the get-go, they’re super-keen. But it’s all too easy for the public to be shunted to the sidelines when the big budgets and complexity of infrastructure projects get going. It’s common for public involvement to be seen as an inefficiency – in science, politics, finance, technology and more – a “nice to have” that takes too much time and effort when we’re in the serious business of things like climate change, economics and keeping the trains running on time. But the opposite is true, especially when it comes to climate action. It’s the public who are driving change, often despite the actions of policy-makers. Community energy offers a particularly powerful way to give members of the public a role in decarbonisation. Moreover, by tapping into their energy, enthusiasm and ability to bring other members of the public with them, we’ll get it done faster, as well as fairer. If it wasn’t for community energy groups coming up with this idea, pushing it forward and scoping out the places it could be utilised, solar trains would still be far more than a few years away.

If that sounds remote, it doesn’t do justice to how removed nearby locals feel from the energy debate in Canberra. As government MPs and national newspapers have thundered in recent days over whether taxpayers should support coal-fired power, occasionally mauling advice from government agencies as they went, residents of South Australia’s Upper Spencer Gulf region have been left to ponder why decision-makers are not paying more attention to what is happening in their backyard. In mid 2016, this region was on the brink, hit by the closure and near collapse of coal and steel plants. Now it’s on the cusp of a wave of construction that investors and community leaders say should place the region at the vanguard of green innovation – not just in Australia but globally. There has been an explosion in investment, with $5bn spread over the next five years. There are 13 projects in various stages of development, with more than 3,000 construction and 200 ongoing jobs. The economy of this once-deflated region has been transformed and those who live here are starting to feel hopeful again. The Port Augusta mayor, Sam Johnson, a 32-year-old former Liberal member, is continually surprised at how resistant some are to the idea that the energy environment has changed. “You might choose to ignore what’s happening here now because we’re out of sight, out of mind, but the reality is that what’s happening here is going to be happening on the eastern seaboard in the next 10 years,” he says. * * * In simple terms, the Upper Spencer Gulf transition story goes like this. Port Augusta was a coal town, home to the state’s only two lignite – or brown coal – plants, Playford B and Northern. Playford B, ageing and failing, was mothballed in 2012. Northern, the larger and younger of the two, closed in May 2016 when owner Alinta Energy decided it was no longer economically viable. The Leigh Creek mine that supplied it, by then offering up mostly low-quality coal, shut at the same time. About 400 workers at the plant and the mine lost their jobs. Roughly a third retired, a third found other employment locally and a third had to leave town to find work. At the same time, further around the gulf, the steel town of Whyalla was teetering precipitously after the owner, Arrium, put the mill in voluntary administration facing debts of more than $4bn. Yet as the doom hit, there were also rays of hope as several clean power projects were mooted for the surrounding area. Two years on, the Port Augusta city council lists 13 projects at varying stages of development. And Whyalla has unearthed a potential saviour in British billionaire industrialist Sanjeev Gupta, who not only bought the steelworks but promised to expand it while also spending what will likely end up being $1.5bn in solar, hydro and batteries to make it viable. Gupta says the logic behind his investment in solar and storage is simple: it’s now cheaper than coal. Johnson says he expects the Upper Gulf region to receive $5bn in clean energy investment over the next five years. “My gut feel – and I’m an optimist – is that they will all go ahead,” he says. “They are different technologies and they are playing in different markets, so they are not competing for power purchase agreements.” By any measure, the Bungala solar power plant is vast. Once its second stage is complete, 800,000 photovoltaic modules will cover an area the size of the Melbourne central business district. The scale is neatly summarised by Chris Rowe, the plant’s operations manager and, with maintenance officer Andrew Bartsch, our tour guide around the site. Both men recently returned to Port Augusta after working away to take up positions with Enel Green Power. One day Rowe decided to stroll back from the 275MW farm’s outer edge, weaving in and out of the rows of panels as he went. By the time he got back to his office, he had covered 12km. “At that point I thought, ‘gee, this is really something’,” he says. Bungala is nearing completion, with work on the $425m plant expected to be finished by January. Its first section started feeding into the national electricity grid in May. Further west, ground has been broken on the 59-turbine, 212MW Lincoln Gap wind farm, though progress has temporarily stalled after developer Nexif Energy discovered unexploded ordnance from historic military testing on site. As Guardian Australia visited the region, the South Australian Liberal government gave final approval for a $600m hybrid wind-and-solar energy park on the south-eastern edge of Port Augusta that proponent DP Energy says will be the largest development of its kind in the country. A second stage with more solar and a 400MW battery is slated to follow. At Cultana, just north of Whyalla, Energy Australia is investigating building the country’s first saltwater pumped hydro energy storage plant. It would draw water from the Spencer Gulf, pump it uphill when energy is plentiful and cheap, and convert it to hydro electricity at times of high demand. A decision on the project is expected in 2019. All are potentially agenda setting, but none are as anticipated as the Aurora solar thermal power station. It is the culmination of a push that began in 2010. A research paper by advocacy group Beyond Zero Emissions formed the basis for the creation of Repower Port Augusta, a community group that built widespread support for bringing the developing technology to the region among councils, business and unions. US developer SolarReserve took notice. It plans to use a field of mirrors to heat a molten salt system inside a 234-metre tower. It will both generate electricity and store eight hours of energy that can be sent out when the sun isn’t shining. The company says the $650m plant, to be built at the Carriewerloo sheep station about 30km north of Port Augusta, will be the world’s largest solar tower with storage and provide 5% of the state’s energy needs. The SolarReserve vice-president, Mary Grikas, stresses the plant will operate “just like a conventional coal or gas power station, reliably generating electricity day and night – except without any emissions”. With the increasing emphasis on “firming” power to back up variable renewables, solar thermal is seen as a potentially major player in filling the gaps, along with other fast-starting options such as pumped hydro, lithium-ion batteries and peaking gas. The 150MW Aurora plant is underpinned by a 20-year power supply contract with the South Australian government, but the company is still to finalise a $110m concessional loan with the federal government, the result of a deal with former senator Nick Xenophon in return for his support for company tax cuts. Dan Spencer worked on the solar thermal campaign as an activist with the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and Solar Citizens, relocating from Adelaide for six months to help build local support. Now a campaigner with the Australian Services Union, he is still pinching himself that it is set to become a reality. “The transition from coal hasn’t been perfect, but in a couple of years we will be seeing this incredible project that people not that long ago thought was just pie in the sky,” he says. “The local community really deserves the credit.” * * * Aurora is not the only solar-thermal project linked to the region. Port Augusta is already home to a small concentrated solar-thermal plant owned by Sundrop Farms that it uses to run a hydroponic greenhouse that provides Coles with tomatoes. Also on the horizon, and just as unique design-wise, is a proposal by Solastor, chaired by former Liberal party leader John Hewson. It promises new graphite-based technology to capture solar energy and store it in a load-shifting battery. Hewson says it will be a world-class project. “Solar thermal will take the market, there’s no doubt about that,” he says. Why are developers choosing the Upper Spencer Gulf? Investors say it has several things going for it: great sunshine; a history of electricity generation that left strong connections into the national grid; nearby industry – particularly mine developments – demanding reliable energy; strong facilitating support from the Weatherill Labor government that has continued under the new Liberal premier, Steven Marshall. Ross Garnaut is a former Labor climate policy adviser who is now the president of Zen Energy, a solar and battery firm that has projects in the region and is 51% owned by Gupta. “The Upper Spencer Gulf happens to be a very good place to start,” Garnaut says. “Some coal generation regions have good renewables and others don’t, and no others have them as good as Port Augusta. [But] the Port Augusta developments could be replicated in any region that has good solar and wind resources.” The inclusion of solar thermal is crucial as it means jobs on a semi-industrial scale. Wind and solar photovoltaic plants bring plenty of jobs in construction, but few in operation. Solar thermal has more in common in operation with coal, using steam to spin a turbine. SolarReserve expects to have a 50-strong permanent workforce at the Aurora plant. It is an important point. While enthusiasm about the new projects in the gulf is high, the shift away from coal has not been seamless – less a transition than a period of loss followed by rebirth. There remains significant disappointment, in some cases anger, about what some consider the unnecessary pain caused by a failure to plan for life after coal. Gary Rowbottom is a case in point. A mechanical technical officer at the town’s power stations for 17 years, he joined the Repower Port Augusta campaign in 2012 and became the public face of the campaign. He was persuaded that solar thermal was the future and hopeful Alinta would be persuaded to embrace the technology to replace coal. He says he was naive about how easy that would be. When the company announced Northern’s closure earlier than expected, he was 55 and left hunting for work. Fifty job applications and 11 interviews later, he was still looking. After about 18 months he left town to take a position on a coal plant in central Queensland. He now sees his wife, Debbie, only every couple of months. “It’s not been ideal,” he says. “I did my best to get a job that would have kept me home. I guess it was hurting me financially, watching my redundancy steadily getting eroded away, and I had a growing sense of failure. I worry that others are going through the same thing.” Rowbottom is buoyed by the developments under way at home, and hopeful the Aurora solar thermal plant will provide his ticket back. “It’s great it is happening. We just wish it could have happened a bit sooner,” he says. “What is hard for many of us to understand is why the closure couldn’t have been organised as a proper transition.” Johnson, who ran unsuccessfully for Xenophon’s SA Best party at the state election, says Port Augusta is set to be the renewable energy capital of the country, with more ongoing jobs if all proposed projects in the Upper Spencer Gulf go ahead than at the former coal plant. But he says both the former Labor state and current Coalition federal governments failed to offer the community the support it needed when the coal plant closed. The ramifications of the rapid closure were significant. Some small businesses and shut. Dirt and coal ash continue to blanket Port Augusta when the wind blows from the south-east because the former coal plant site was not properly rehabilitated. Wholesale electricity prices across the state increased more than they would have had more significant replacement generation been readied earlier. “I’d love for people to learn from what’s happened here [about] what not to do when you’re closing a power station,” Johnson says. * * * Whyalla seems to have fewer issues in the wake of Gupta’s arrival in July 2017. Seeing a business opportunity that governments and publicly listed companies did not, he promised to initially spend $1bn to double the steel mill’s production and convert it to a “green steel” model he has applied in other countries. This includes using more recycled steel and investing heavily in clean energy close to the plant. He is spending $700m building two farms of solar panels, a cogeneration plant to convert the waste gases from steel production into electricity, the country’s largest lithium-ion battery and up to three pumped hydro plants in disused mining pits in the Middlebank Ranges. He says more will follow. Both Gupta and Johnson say the message for the rest of the country is: embrace change. Gupta says: “Be braver. Be more entrepreneurial. Take risks … It is very difficult to change things in Australia. Everyone is too stuck in their ways.” Johnson says: “You can resist change as much as you like, but the reality is, if you’re in a community that has a coal-fired power station, its days are numbered. The market is dictating that change whether we like it or not. “My advice is: learn from the Port Augusta experience. I wish the federal government would.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2019/oct/14/renewable-electricity-overtakes-fossil-fuels-in-uk-for-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-13T23:01:04Z","webTitle":"Renewable electricity overtakes fossil fuels in UK for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/14/renewable-electricity-overtakes-fossil-fuels-in-uk-for-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2019/oct/14/renewable-electricity-overtakes-fossil-fuels-in-uk-for-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Renewable electricity overtakes fossil fuels in UK for first time","bodyText":"Renewable energy sources provided more electricity to UK homes and businesses than fossil fuels for the first time over the last quarter, according to new research. The renewables record was set in the third quarter of this year after its share of the electricity mix rose to 40%. It is the first time that electricity from British windfarms, solar panels and renewable biomass plants has surpassed fossil fuels since the UK’s first power plant fired up in 1882. The new milestone confirms predictions made by National Grid that 2019 will be the first year since the Industrial Revolution that zero-carbon electricity – renewables and nuclear – overtakes gas and coal-fired power. A string of new offshore windfarms built this year helped nudge renewables past fossil fuels, which made up 39% of UK electricity, in a crucial tipping point in Britain’s energy transition. Fossil fuels made up four-fifths of the country’s electricity fewer than 10 years ago, split between gas and coal, but the latest analysis by Carbon Brief shows that coal-fired power was less than 1% of all electricity generated. British coal plants are shutting down ahead of a 2025 ban. By next spring just four coal plants will remain in the UK: the West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar plants in Nottinghamshire, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and two generation units at the Drax site in North Yorkshire, which are earmarked for conversion to burn gas. Gas-fired power makes up the bulk of the dwindling share of fossil fuels in the energy system at 38%. Nuclear power provided slightly less than a fifth of the UK’s electricity in the last quarter, the report said. Wind power is the UK’s strongest source of renewable energy and made up 20% of the UK’s electricity following a series of major windfarm openings in recent years. Electricity from renewable biomass plants made up 12% of the energy system, while solar panels contributed 6%. The world’s largest offshore windfarm, the Hornsea One project, began generating electricity off the Yorkshire coast in February, reaching a peak capacity of 1,200MW in October. It followed the opening of the Beatrice windfarm off the north-east coast of Scotland over the summer. Together these schemes almost doubled the 2,100MW worth of offshore capacity which began powering homes in 2018. Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister for energy and clean growth, said the renewables record is “yet another milestone on our path towards ending our contribution to climate change altogether by 2050”. He said: “Already, we’ve cut emissions by 40% while growing the economy by two thirds since 1990. Now, with more offshore wind projects on the way at record low prices we plan to go even further and faster in the years to come.” Luke Clark, of Renewable UK, said the industry hopes to treble the size of its offshore wind sector by 2030 to generate more than a third of the UK’s electricity. Under the Labour party’s plans for Green Industrial Revolution the offshore wind industry would grow five-fold in a decade, with the addition of an extra 37 giant offshore windfarms and 70,000 new jobs. According to Renewable UK, the growth of the renewables industry is good news for energy bills, as well as the environment, due to the steep fall in the cost of wind and solar power technologies over recent years. “The cost of new offshore wind projects, for example, has just fallen to an all-time low, making onshore and offshore wind our lowest-cost large scale power sources,” Clark said. The next generation of offshore windfarms is expected to cost about £40 for every megawatt hour of electricity generated, less than the average market price for electricity on the wholesale energy markets. “If government were to back a range of technologies – like onshore wind and marine renewables – in the same way as it is backing offshore wind, consumers and businesses would be able to fully reap the benefits of the transition to a low carbon economy,” Clark said. • This article was amended on 14 October 2019 because an earlier version said the Hornsea One project was off the Norfolk coast, when the Yorkshire coast was meant.

The energy system operator is under investigation by the industry regulator, and the government, after Britain’s biggest blackout in more than a decade struck large parts of England and Wales on 9 August. The system operator revealed that it had been running the risk of blackouts over a year before the outage, which cut electricity to almost a million homes. To safeguard the system it has been working on a series of software agreements with companies including the US giant General Electric (GE) to replace its spreadsheet models, which provide estimates of the grid’s stability. National Grid is understood to be close to announcing a deal with GE to measure energy system “inertia”, or the energy buffer that helps to keep frequency stable, following a separate deal with another technology firm for similar software in August. A National Grid spokesman said the initiatives are the first of their kind anywhere in the world, and will be incorporated “over the coming years”. The FTSE 100 company has invested about £10bn in modernising the grid over the past six years but industry sources fear that its efforts are not coming fast enough to adapt to the quicker-than-expected rollout of new energy technologies. The deals have emerged after a senior National Grid executive revealed last July that the company was “walking blind” because it cannot measure the stability of the grid. Duncan Burt, the operations head, said: “If we don’t know if the grid is secure, then we are walking blind into operating scenarios that we don’t understand well. Grid operators don’t like to do that because walking blind into those scenarios puts your grid at risk – it can increase the chance of power blackouts and failures.” GE’s new technology works by collecting data readings 50 times per second to monitor changes in the grid’s stability, and by predicting the inertia needs up to 24 hours in advance. Renan Giovanini, an analytics manager at GE, said the new systems will “help to reduce the likelihood of a blackout” by evolving the tools National Grid uses to assess the energy grid. National Grid has blamed lightning strikes for triggering a series of power-plant outages on 9 August, leading to a sharp fall in the system’s frequency, which caused the blackout. It said low inertia can amplify the impact of outages by allowing the system frequency to fall faster than expected. The energy system’s inertia is typically lower than it was 10 years ago following the move from large-scale fossil-fuel plants to renewable energy projects, which is making it more difficult to maintain healthy inertia and frequency. A spokesman for National Grid said its systems “are appropriate” for the levels of wind and solar power in operation but the company plans to “embrace new technologies” by 2025 when it wants to be able to run a carbon-free system. • Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/nov/16/power-to-the-people-how-suburban-solar-could-become-the-uber-of-the-energy-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-16T19:00:44Z","webTitle":"Power to the people: how suburban solar could become the Uber of the energy grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/16/power-to-the-people-how-suburban-solar-could-become-the-uber-of-the-energy-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/nov/16/power-to-the-people-how-suburban-solar-could-become-the-uber-of-the-energy-grid","fields":{"headline":"Power to the people: how suburban solar could become the Uber of the energy grid","bodyText":"Power to the people might remain a political pipe dream, but changes taking place in the energy market across Australia are making suburban homeowners the unlikely disruptors in an Uber-style revolution that promises to change how we all live. Despite a toxic political debate about energy that cost the last prime minister his job, thousands of households are showing Canberra the way forward as they group their individual solar systems together to form local networks that help to slash bills, stabilise the electricity grid and cut carbon emissions. Alan Hedges, a retiree in South Australia, is part of one so-called “virtual power plant” (VPP), hailed this week by the energy commission as the way of the future. With solar panels feeding a 10kWh storage battery at his house in Gilberton in Adelaide, Hedges is close to self-sufficient in power and has seen his bills fall to fraction of what he used to pay. The VPP means that electricity stored in his battery – and from others on the network – flows into the national grid at times of peak demand to balance the system and prevent outages. So not only is he reaping the financial benefits, he is also doing his bit to stave off the mass blackouts that brought the state to a standstill in September 2016. “I received my first bill the other day and it was $46.57 for 57 days, which works out at $1.68 per day,” he said. That’s 84% cheaper than his old bills of more than $1,000 a quarter. “I thought ‘wow’, they must have made a mistake. But I’ve read it through and it’s right. It’s amazing.” Hedges was helped by the South Australian government’s home battery scheme, and received $6,000 off the cost of his Tesla battery – about half the total cost. But the revolution is going on elsewhere, Elon Musk or not. Patricia Harris lives with her husband in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. Their panels and battery system have enabled them to become one of 237 households who are part of a scheme run by Ausgrid and a Canberra software company called Reposit. She welcomes the money they save – “we’re miles ahead on the deal,” she says – but there is another motivation at a time when the world is threatened by a climate crisis. “The system works and it works well. We are making a profit,” she says. “We’ll get the money back for the battery and panels, but we just liked the idea of it. We thought ‘we’ll do our bit for the environment’.” This empowerment lies at the heart of the matter, according to Rob Amphlett Lewis, chief customer officer at Ausgrid, which sees itself as facilitating sweeping changes that he likens to tech disruptors such as Uber and Airbnb. “It’s very much like Uber where the individual shares his car,” he says. “Here the individual shares his or her battery and they make money. “When we have high demand we can call on all that power stored in people’s batteries and ease constraints in the grid. The traditional way to fix this would be to build more infrastructure, but having batteries means we don’t have to build that infrastructure. “This really is the future and it’s coming very quickly.” Reposit has been creating such systems in Australia for six years. Its chief executive, Dean Spaccavento, says the company now has thousands of customers up and down Australia’s east coast, from Queensland to Victoria. It adds one megawatt of capacity every month, which is the equivalent of 100 households with a 10kWh battery, and hopes to add 5,000 customers in the next 12 months. The particularly smart part of the system – and others like it – enables the battery to think for itself so that it can be set to control household appliances according to when they are cheapest to use. This reduces demand at peak times and means there is more power from home batteries to be diverted into the grid. Amphlett Lewis says: “Home energy systems mean appliances such as aircon can be controlled to stay at a certain temperature. It means we consume less. If lots of people turn down their aircon slightly, it doesn’t inconvenience anyone but it can make a big difference and facilitate the use of renewable energy.” The scheme has been so successful that Ausgrid is planning a community battery scheme in Sydney and is looking for would-be participants to register. This would allow anyone with solar power to connect to the battery and deposit and withdraw electricity. “It means less infrastructure so more savings,” says Amphlett Lewis. “It’s a win, win, win for the community.” And while it might not fix Australia’s energy woes overnight, it appears to be an important step forward and one in which many people will be able to take part. “There is no one silver bullet to fix the problems with the Australian electricity market. But these sort of ideas will deliver the future of energy. Customers are taking a big, big role and our role is to facilitate it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/jun/28/build-more-nuclear-reactors-to-reach-net-zero-carbon-target-cbi","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-27T23:01:07Z","webTitle":"Build more nuclear reactors to reach net zero carbon target – CBI","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/28/build-more-nuclear-reactors-to-reach-net-zero-carbon-target-cbi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/jun/28/build-more-nuclear-reactors-to-reach-net-zero-carbon-target-cbi","fields":{"headline":"Build more nuclear reactors to reach net zero carbon target – CBI","bodyText":"The UK should keep building large-scale nuclear plants and “mini-nuke” reactors to help reach a net zero carbon target by 2050, according to Britain’s biggest business group. In a letter to the business secretary, Greg Clark, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the UK’s struggling new nuclear programme has “an important role” in a low carbon economy “at the right price”. It said a funding model for large-scale nuclear and small modular reactors would help provide economic benefits by encouraging foreign investment into the UK. The government is struggling to agree a funding framework for a follow up to EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C new nuclear project which has been widely criticised for being too expensive at an expected £20bn. EDF will begin construction of the nuclear buildings above ground from Friday, and is on track to powering 7% of the UK’s electricity system by the end of 2025. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI’s chief economist, said it is “mission critical” that business, politicians and the public work together to create a net zero carbon economy by 2050. The CBI letter was released after the climate goal officially became law on Thursday. It also follows a flurry of government funding for nine new carbon capture pilot projects, which will trap and store emissions before they enter the atmosphere. The CBI has also called on the government to “unblock” the pipeline of new onshore wind farms if it hopes to reduce the cost of moving to a zero carbon economy. The business group warned that “hindering the continued deployment of the cheapest form of renewable electricity is hampering the goal of decarbonising at the lowest cost”. “We must see action to unblock the substantial pipeline of onshore wind projects ready to be developed and built in parts of the country where they receive public support, such as Scotland,” the letter said. It also called for government to help create a route to market for low-cost solar power, including projects that combine battery storage. “Firms want to see a whole host of stable, long-term policies enacted – from building new nuclear power stations to scaling-up carbon capture and storage technology and infrastructure – that send markets a robust signal: the UK is open for green business, and is a world leader in tackling climate change,” Newton-Smith said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2021/nov/08/uk-us-flights-resume-travel-ban-markets-crypto-rally-tesla-musk-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-08T17:54:22Z","webTitle":"US lifts UK travel ban; UK consumer confidence lowest since March; Dow hits record – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/nov/08/uk-us-flights-resume-travel-ban-markets-crypto-rally-tesla-musk-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2021/nov/08/uk-us-flights-resume-travel-ban-markets-crypto-rally-tesla-musk-business-live","fields":{"headline":"US lifts UK travel ban; UK consumer confidence lowest since March; Dow hits record – as it happened","bodyText":"Time to wrap up..... with today’s main stories: Goodnight.

Last week, Bailey explained that the Bank wants to see more data showing how ending the UK’s furlough scheme has affected unemployment, and insisted the bank wouldn’t ‘bottle’ a rate rise. Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham has been speaking to some of the passengers travelling to the US on BA flight 001 from Heathrow today. Here’s a flavour: Jemmi Fajer, 22, an easyJet flight attendant from Lyon, had planned trips to visit friends in New York city three times during the pandemic in the hope that the rules would change, but had to cancel each time. She said: “I’m so excited to be finally going – just to see old friends, stroll around, see all my favourite neighbourhoods. Jean Berrigan, 72, a retired nurse from Suffolk, described herself as a solo traveller – frustrated during the pandemic – and was heading out for a four-night stay in the US, where she used to work. “I was watching and thought as soon as it opens up, I’m going. I’m so pleased it’s opened up for everyone, families reuniting.” A ticket for the first flight cost more but, she said: “I just thought I’m going regardless – I booked the first flight I could.” More stories here, including Bhavna and Bindiya Patel from south Croydon who were flying to reunite with family, and businessman Nigel Scorey who says technology such as Zoom means he won’t need to travel as much. After a day lacking in drama, the UK stock market has closed with the FTSE 100 down just 3.5 points, or 0.05%, at 7,300 points. Germany’s DAX also dipped a little, while France’s CAC inched up. Spain’s IBEX lost 0.6%, after solid gains on Friday, with hotel groups and banks dropping. David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital says: It has been a quiet start to the week following the exciting moves seen in the markets last week. The actions of the Federal Reserve and Bank of England pushed up stocks, and Friday’s US non-farm payrolls report was the icing on the cake. Today, the European session is lacklustre, which is why the DAX, and the FTSE are showing modest gains. BP and Royal Dutch Shell are higher on account of the rally in oil, and that is helping the British market. The Dow Jones has posted a new record high as the House of Representatives passed a $1 trillion infrastructure spending bill, the S&amp;P 500 is up on the session but the sell off in Tesla shares is holding back the index slightly. In other takeover news, cyber security software company McAfee has agreed to be taken over for $14bn by a consortium of investors led by private equity firms Advent International and Permira Advisers. It’s one of the largest leveraged buyouts of the year, and the Financial Times have more details: The takeover consortium, which also includes minority investors made up of private equity firm Crosspoint Capital Partners, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, will pay McAfee shareholders $26 a share, a 21 per cent premium to its market price on November 4. As IT departments move on to cloud networks, cyber security companies have grown and received heavy investment from private equity firms with specialist practices dedicated to the technology. If completed as expected in the second half of 2022, the deal will end McAfee’s brief run on public stock markets after private equity owners TPG and Thoma Bravo listed it in October 2020. More here: The British satellite communications company Inmarsat has agreed a $7.3bn (£5.4bn) takeover by the California-based Viasat, becoming the latest UK tech firm to be taken over by a foreign rival. The deal is the latest in which a UK company that plays a key role in Britain’s economy and national security is to be taken over by foreign rivals or private equity firms. Inmarsat was listed on the London Stock Exchange before being taken private two years ago by a consortium including the private equity firm Apax. Viasat, which described the deal as “transformative” for the global communications industry, said it intended to work with the government to continue to invest and grow Inmarsat’s presence in the UK. More here: Back in monetary policy...one Federal Reserve policymaker has suggested today that America’s central bank could lift interest rates twice next year - while another was more dovish. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank president James Bullard said he expects the Fed to raise interest rates twice in 2022 after it wraps up its bond-buying programme by the middle of next year. Bullard, who is generally a hawkish voice, also suggested the Fed could speed up its tapering if needed (it has begun cutting $15bn per month off its $120bn/month bond-buying stimulus, which would see it end next June). He told Fox Business Network: “If inflation is more persistent than we are saying right now, then I think we may have to take a little sooner action in order to keep inflation under control. Asked if the Fed could then raise rates three or four times next year, Bullard said “That is not my base case right now.” Federal Reserve vice chair Richard Clarida took a more cautious approach today, suggesting that the “necessary conditions” to raise the U.S. central bank’s benchmark lending rate from near-zero will probably be in place at the end of next year. Clarida told a symposium on monetary policy that the Fed was “clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates”. Given the progress it is seeking towards mximum employment and price stability, he added: “I believe that these three necessary conditions for raising the target range for the federal funds rate will have been met by year-end 2022,” Airline pilot Scott Bateman, who founded the Pilots Together charity, has some interesting observations on today’s flights: The British Airways and Virgin Atlantic A350-1000s which left London together this morning after the US lifted their ban on fully vaccinated international visitors have both now landed in New York. The trip took just over 7 hours, according to FlightRadar24 data, which shows Virgin’s VS3 landing at JFK at 10.51am local time (3.51pm in the UK) and British Airways’ BA001 at 11am EST (4pm UK). Shares in Tesla dropped in early trading in New York, after millions of Twitter users polled by chief executive Elon Musk voted he should sell 10 per cent of his stake in the electric carmaker. But Musk’s unorthodox poll hasn’t caused a rout. After dropping at the open, Tesla’s shares are now down just 2.7% at $1,190, from Friday’s closing price of $1,221, as traders anticipate future stock sales. That would knock around $30bn off Tesla’s market capitalisation (which broke through the $1 trillion mark last month). But it only takes the stock back to levels seen last week, when it hit fresh record highs after surging more than 44% during October. Musk, who is sitting on a paper fortune of more than $338bn in Tesla and Space-X shares, proposed selling 10% of his Tesla shares in order to generate enough money to pay a proposed “billionaires tax” on “unrealised capital gains”. But... Musk did flag back in September that he’d soon have to sell a huge block of options before they expired -- so there are suggestions that the Twitter poll could provide a handy smokescreen. And the whole episode has been criticised by senator Ron Wyden, who is pushing for a billionaires tax. Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and chair of the Senate finance committee, said yesterday: “Whether or not the world’s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn’t depend on the results of a Twitter poll. It’s time for the billionaires income tax.” In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading. The Dow jumped by 188 points, or 0.5%, to 36,516 points at the open. The rally is led by construction equipment maker Caterpillar (+3.8%), financial services groups American Express (+2%) and Visa (+1.5%), chemicals firm Dow Inc (+2%) and chipmaker Intel (+1.6%). Materials, energy, financial stocks and industrials are the best-performing sectors across the market. Investors are in upbeat mood after the US economy added more jobs than expected in last Friday’s non-farm payroll report, and the House of Representatives finally passed a $1tn bill to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure. Tightening monetary policy now to fight the surge in inflation across the eurozone would be counterproductive, European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane has warned today. Lane pushed back against pressure to take action, after consumer prices inflation hit 4.1% last month - more than double the ECB’s target. In a speech to the ECB Conference on Money Markets, Lane said three temporary factors were pushing up inflation today but are projected to fade over the course of next year. First, the pandemic initially exerted powerful downward pressure on inflation, hitting activity and leading to temporary tax cuts (such as VAT in Germany) which are now being reversed Second, the unexpectedly-strong European and global recovery from the pandemic shock has caused bottlenecks, and mismatches between supply and demand of commodities and manufactured goods Third, energy prices have been the largest single contributor to the currently-high inflation rate. And as Europe is a net importer of energy, that actually pushes down underlying inflation as it depressing the net revenues of European firms and the disposable income of European households. As such, Lane argues there are “solid reasons” to expect inflation to decline through the course of next year. And as it takes time for monetary policy to affect the inflation rate, tightening too early would hurt the economy. As Lane puts it: In particular, an abrupt tightening of monetary policy today would not lower the currently-high inflation rates but would serve to slow down the economy and reduce employment over the next couple of years and thereby reduce medium-term inflation pressure. Given our assessment that the medium-term inflation trajectory remains below our two per cent target, it would be counter-productive to tighten monetary policy at the current juncture. Lane added that it will be crucial to watch wage growth, to deduce the path of underlying inflation. But he also signalled that a one-off jump in pay might not show that inflation was taking off. In particular, a one-off shift in the level of wages as part of the adjustment to a transitory unexpected increase in the price level does not imply a trend shift in the path of underlying inflation. Back in Heathrow, travellers excited to see family and friends for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began have been arriving to fly to the US. Months of pent-up demand triggered a major spike in bookings on Monday, with travellers only required to show official proof of vaccination and a recent, negative viral test. Alice Keane, travelling to Miami to see her sister, told Reuters at London’s Heathrow airport that the resumption of flights was very exciting. I mean, I was meant to go just before Covid happened, and obviously it’s been delayed this long, so it’s really exciting to finally be able to go.” More here. Heads-up: It was UK business output growth that slowed again in October (see earlier post, now updated). Sorry for the confusion, and thanks to kind readers for flagging. Gambling companies are among the heaviest advertisers on radio during “school run” hours when millions of children are in the car, according to research that prompted warnings about their exposure to promotions for the national lottery, online casinos and sports betting. Data shows gambling came second in a list of industries that spend the most to appear on commercial radio between 7am and 8am and from 3pm to 4pm, according to an analysis for the Guardian by market analysis firm Nielsen. The analysts found that gambling accounted for 5% of all spending during school-run hours, with about 1,200 hours of ads airing during those times over the past 12 months. The amount spent on gambling ads was exceeded only by government communications – including Covid-19 messages – and motor supplies. Nielsen does not disclose the actual spending figures because it is commercially sensitive data. Here’s the full story. Workers at two Weetabix factories are launching four-day strikes from today in a dispute over pay and conditions. Members of Unite at the company’s Kettering and Corby factories have been on strike every Tuesday and Wednesday since September over proposed changes to working practices that they claim could leave them up to £5,000 a year worse off. The union claims engineers face cuts to their pay, terms and conditions, describing it as an example of a “fire and rehire” policy and Weetbix’s “corporate greed”, which the company denies. In an escalation of the dispute, strikes are to take place every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. More here: A spokesperson for Weetabix Food Company says the group has plans to mitigate shortages: “We are working hard to minimise disruptions to our operations. We have a naturally resilient supply chain and have robust planning in place to help mitigate any shortages as a result of the strikes,” There could be shortages in the snacks aisle too, after a botched computer upgrade disrupted the world’s biggest crisp factory. Walkers has been forced to prioritise its most popular varieties – including cheese and onion, ready salted and salt and vinegar, as well as Quavers and Wotsits – after the glitch forced it to slow production. A spokesperson said “more niche” varieties had been slowed, explaining: “A recent IT system upgrade has disrupted the supply of some of our products. Our sites are still making crisps and snacks but at a reduced scale. “We’re doing everything we can to increase production and get people’s favourites back on shelves. We’re very sorry for the inconvenience caused.” There’s not much drama in the City so far today, with the FTSE 100 flat and the pound slightly higher after last week’s losses. Cyber-security firm Darktrace is doing its best to provide some excitement, surging 10% this morning after analysts at Berenberg reiterated its ‘buy’ stance after a visit to its headquarters last week. Darktrace had tumbled last week, as the lock-up on insiders selling shares expired. Asset manager Abrdn have jumped 3.4%, after it confirmed it’s in talks to potentially buy Interactive Investor, the UK’s second-largest fund supermarket. A deal could value II at over £1.5bn. It would boost Abrdn’s direct-to-consumer offering, and derail II’s plans to float on the stock market. Travel and hospitality stocks are having a weaker day, though, having surged on Friday after Pfizer announced that its experimental antiviral pill, paxlovid, had cut hospitalisations and deaths from Covid by nearly 90% in a large trial. British Airways parent company IAG is down 2.3%, despite the reopening of the US borders, alongside broadcaster ITV (+2.3%), conference organiser Informa and property developer British Land. Rolls-Royce is expected to announce a major investment this week in its plans to develop small-scale modular nuclear reactors to rival the floundering multi-billion plans for large-scale nuclear plants. The company is expected to confirm that a consortium of investors has agreed to back plans for an initial four Small Modular Reactors (SMR) based on the same nuclear technology which propels submarines. The imminent announcement, which was first reported by the BBC, comes after the UK government promised to provide £210m in funding to SMR developers if they could match the funds with private capital as part of the Prime Minister’s ten point Green Plan. Small modular reactors have emerged as an alternative to building large-scale nuclear power plants - such as the 3,200MW Hinkley Point C project - which face enormous construction risks, and are prone to spiralling costs and delays. Rolls’ SMRs are expected to have a generation capacity of 500MW and cost around £2bn each, meaning they should cost less than a tenth of the £20bn each of EDF’s Hinkley project, and its successor plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. Here are more details from last month: Here’s the scene at Heathrow airport as the US reopens its borders: Here’s our news story on the resumption of UK flights to the US this morning, as a 20-month ban was lifted. Robert Courts, under-secretary of state for transport, has told the PA news agency that today is a ‘massive moment for the aviation sector’. “It’s about people fundamentally, it’s about getting families back together... “That’s particularly important with Thanksgiving and Christmas coming up. “That’s on top of the massive economic benefit that there is from having the United States and Great Britain - these great friends and allies, countries that have so much in common - back in regular contact with each other again.” Hotel group Hilton has seen a jump in bookings since the US announced it would lift travel restrictions for fully vaccinated arrivals today. Simon Vincent, EVP &amp; President, Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa at Hilton, says: “Since news broke of the planned reopening of US borders, we’ve seen a surge of interest from European and UK guests planning to visit our US hotels. Hilton search data reveals the extent of that demand, with a 63% increase in digital reservations in the five weeks following the news of plans to ease restrictions. We’ve seen similar trends across Europe, with inbound demand from US guests growing as travel rules have lifted. The reopening of the US border signals the next important phase of recovery for the industry, and we look forward to welcoming a new dawn of international travel.” Today’s report shows that people’s confidence in their household finances is deteriorating, says Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor. Airlines may be in celebratory mood today, but UK consumers are feeling less optimistic. Pessimism about household finances have dragged down consumer confidence for the third month running, as people judge that their financial situation has deteriorated - and is going to get worse. This follows rising inflation, surging gas prices, looming tax increases, growing supply chain problems, and the recent fuel shortages. The latest poll from YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research found that consumer confidence is the lowest since the last Covid-19 lockdown ended this spring. Confidence about household finances over the next year has taken a sharp dive. The survey, conducted during October, shows: Consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level since March 2021, down -1.3 points to 109.2 Outlook on household finances continued its five-month freefall, dropping 9.7 points October’s household finances fell by 5.0 points for the second month Expectations for business activity continued to worsen for the second month in a row But business activity reported for October saw largest leap since March 2021 For the second consecutive month, Britons reported a decline in their household finances over the past month. This measure dropped by 5.0 points to 84.6. People are also more pessimistic about their economic outlook. The outlook on household finances slumped to 81.1 – a decline of 9.7 points and the third-largest fall on record. Darren Yaxley, direct of reputation research at YouGov, says there’s a mood of ‘general pessimism’. “October’s index confirms that consumer confidence is on a downwards trajectory, largely propelled by Britons’ concern for their personal finances. The decreases seen for household financial situation over the past 30 days and the coming 12 months are the largest since the start of the pandemic. “While three metrics saw improvements - October’s business activity, and job security for the past month and coming year - the remaining metrics decreased indicating this month’s index is one of general pessimism. This indicates that the last few months of fuel and food shortages paired with rising bills and prices have led Britons to be concerned for the future.” There is one bright note: Despite the end of the government furlough scheme, workers feel more optimistic about their job security in the next 12 months than they did in September. But generally, families are worried about living standards. Kay Neufeld, Head of Forecasting and Thought Leadership, says: “The slump in consumer confidence continued in October, meaning that the YouGov/Cebr Index has erased the gains made since March 2021, when strict lockdown measures were still in place. Consumers judge their financial situation to have deteriorated in October and show even greater pessimism for the year ahead. With inflation expected to exceed 4% before the end of the year and steeply rising energy prices, households are understandably worried about the impact on living standards. On a more positive note, increases in the two job security measures highlight the ongoing resilience of the UK labour market that seems to have coped well with the end of the furlough scheme. However, ongoing shortages of inputs could lead some firms to scale back production in coming months, which would reduce labour demand.” Tesla’s Frankfurt-listed shares are down nearly 6% this morning as investors prepared for the chief executive Elon Musk’s proposed sale of about a tenth of his holdings in the electric carmaker after his Twitter poll. Musk, the world’s richest person, tweeted on Saturday that he would offload 10% of his stock if users of the social media network approved the proposal. The poll attracted more than 3.5m votes and 57.9% of people voted “yes”. Musk had said previously he would have to exercise a large number of stock options in the next three months, which would create a big tax bill. Selling some of his stock could free up funds to pay the taxes. “I was prepared to accept either outcome,” Musk said, after the voting ended. Market participants expected speculators would try to front-run his selling. Tesla’s stock is currently down over 5% in pre-market trading in New York (although only to its lowest level in a week). British businesses’ output growth has fallen for the sixth month in a row amid a supply chain crisis, energy price rises and a shortages of workers, according to a closely watched survey of big employers [updated]. UK business output growth hit its lowest level since March (during the last national coronavirus lockdown), according to the accountancy firm BDO. Its measure fell from 105.23 points in September to 103.35 points in October. BDO’s manufacturing index dropped two points to 97, nearing the 95 mark, which indicates declining output, while staff shortages prompted a slowdown in growth in the services sector, which dominates the UK economy. “Businesses are facing an increasingly difficult winter,” said Kaley Crossthwaite, a BDO partner, adding: “Between rising inflation and a lack of staff, 2022 could be a difficult year for companies who have been forced to prioritise short-term problems over long-term growth. At the same time, consumers are beginning to see the impact of these shortages, with rising fuel and energy prices, which may in turn lead to cutbacks in discretionary spending. “In the final months of the year, businesses and consumers alike will be hoping that the economy can find some Christmas spirit over November and December and help take us into the new year on a high.” Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic chief executive, has told Sky News that it’s a big, dramatic day, and a fantastic one for aviation and his own company. But he’s also suggested that travellers may need to rethink behaviour such as day trips abroad, due to the impact on the climate. It’s really lovely to see families reuniting, grandparents meeting grandchildren, people belatedly going on honeymoon, says Weiss, speaking from Heathrow as transatlantic leisure flights resume after 600 days of the US border being shut down for UK nationals. Weiss says this morning’s parallel takeoff with British Airways at 8.50am took a lot of organising. And in a nod to concerns over environmental impact of transatlantic flights, Weiss says both airlines are using A350-1000s, the most fuel-efficient planes in their fleets. The competition will not be who gets their quickest, but rather who gets there on time with the most efficient use of fuel. Looking ahead, Weiss says that demand will be unpredictable for a bit, but Virgin Atlantic is already seeing very strong demand for Christmas, Easter, and next summer. And this week is ‘absolutely full’. Business travel will follow, he insists, despite the boom in video-conferencing tools since the move to homeworking, with signs that small and medium-sized firms are travelling again. Q: But what about the climate damage caused by international travel? Two A350s just took off simultaneously to take passengers to the US, in the middle of the Cop26 talks in Glasgow. What can passengers do to be more environmentally aware? Weiss says aviation ‘needs to do its part’. Airlines have committed to become net-zero by 2050, -- but he admits that’s a long way away. So Virgin is taking steps like using younger planes (68% of its fleets are next-generation jets which are more fuel-efficient). And Weiss suggests that travellers need to be conscious about the issue too, saying: The day trip to Brussels, the day trip to New York may be not the best use of time. But combining leisure and business into a longer trip is the thing to do. And on the pandemic, Weiss says that the successful vaccination development, high vaccination rates and new treatments coming online gives him confidence that we are moving forwards not backwards. It’s a testament to scientists, governments, and the NHS that we are in this position now. There were clear skies and a bright new dawn at London Heathrow for its biggest customers, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, who took off simultaneously in a show of extraordinary solidarity on Monday morning, flying west with planes fully loaded with passengers and revenues rolling in as the US finally opened its borders to foreign visitors again. Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham, who is aboard BA’s flight, reports. For both airlines, US markets constitute the biggest part of their business – almost 40% for BA, with six flights scheduled today to New York JFK, alone while 10 of 21 Virgin flights taking off today are for America. A few Americans have travelled the transatlantic throughout, and more since August when the UK and EU relaxed restrictions for incoming, quarantined visitors. But it is more than 600 days since the airlines have been able to sell into their biggest market, crucial as they seek to recover from the pandemic. Speaking before the flight, Virgin chief executive Shai Weiss described it as “a tipping point”. Plenty of other flights were taking off from Heathrow Terminal 5 – if roughly half the number of two years ago - but there was only one destination in town. To underline the significance for anyone who missed it, the BA check-in, the cabins and even the air bridge from the gate to the plane festooned with American flags. The planes took to the skies just after 8.50am – using their most fuel-efficient models, A350s, after both airlines having retired their famous 747 jumbos early as a cost-saving measure during the pandemic. BA flight 001 took off on the northern runway, with Virgin flight VS3 rising into the air exactly in parallel. BA chief executive Sean Doyle told passengers over the tannoy: “This is a real moment of celebration. I know how much today means to you – some have not seen your loved ones for two years, others have not been able to do business.” He also told them that flight BA001 was powered by a blend of 35% sustainable aviation fuel [SAF] – the largest mix used yet on a commercial flight, while remaining emissions would be offset, via wind and solar power projects. “In the years ahead,” Doyle said, “we envisage all our long haul flights will be powered by SAFs.” It was a reminder that aviation still has plenty of challenges ahead. For now, though, some optimism has returned. Friends and family were some of the first to book to fill planes this week, the airlines said, with planes across Virgin’s US departures 98% full till Wednesday. Doyle said there had been a significant bookings too from corporate customers and small businesses, giving lie to the idea that business travel was dead. Bankers in particular had booked to fly back, boosting the revenues from premium cabins. But holidaymakers have also filled the front ends of the planes, according to BA Holidays managing director Claire Bentley: “People are upgrading, treating themselves.” City breaks had generally not been sought after during the pandemic, for those who did try to get away despite the testing requirements and travel restrictions, she said. The US east coast’s biggest city has long been its best seller though and is coming back fast: “New York is in a category of its own.” Here’s a picture of the parallel takeoff, via Twitter user Andrew McConnell: And they’re off! The first British Airways and Virgin Atlantic transatlantic flights carrying leisure travellers to the US since the border closures of March 2020 have taken off. As planned, they left Heathrow in a simultaneous departure from parallel runways, heading for New York’s JFK airport. Here’s a video feed from Heathrow of the takeoff.....starting right now.... BA and Virgin’s jets are lined up, ready for their simultaneous takeoff to New York... There are expected to be few if any empty seats on many of the international flights to the US from London, Paris and elsewhere on Monday, and passenger volume is expected to remain high in the coming weeks, Reuters predicts. Bindiya Patel was one of those intending to be on the first New York-bound BA flight leaving Heathrow this morning. Patel, from south London, was so excited at the prospect of being able to finally meet her nephew in New York that she could not sleep. “I think we might just start crying,” she told Reuters on Monday. Airlines, which have warned there will likely be long queues at first, will check vaccination documentation for international travellers as they currently do for COVID-19 test results. Delta said that in the six weeks since the U.S reopening was announced it had seen a 450% increase in international point-of-sale bookings versus the six weeks prior to the announcement, though most experts believe that corporate travel will lag the recovery in leisure travel. More here: Reuters: Travellers head to the United States as flights reopen Sean Doyle, BA’s chief executive, and Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive, have put aside their usual rivalry to pose for the cameras at Heathrow today, before their joint take-off. Before today’s flights, both CEOs have spoken about how the resumption of flights was a moment to celebrate. Sean Doyle, BA’s chief executive, said: “We’re setting aside rivalry and for the first time ever, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic aircraft will be seen taking off together to mark the vital importance of the transatlantic corridor. “Transatlantic connectivity is vital for the UK’s economic recovery, which is why we’ve been calling for the safe reopening of the UK-US travel corridor for such a long time. We must now look forward with optimism, get trade and tourism back on track, and allow friends and families to connect once again.” Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive, said: “Today is a time for celebration, not rivalry. The US has been our heartland for more than 37 years and we are simply not Virgin without the Atlantic.” The restrictions lifting today have effectively halted tourism and non-essential travel from 33 countries, including the UK, most of Europe and China, Kevin T. Dugan writes. They separated families and loved ones, with thousands missing out on birthdays, holidays – and in the case of the British tennis star Emma Raducanu’s parents – a US Open final. Now all visitors with a WHO-approved vaccination (which includes AstraZeneca) will be allowed to visit the US. Visitors with passports from any country where fewer than 10% of the country’s population has been vaccinated will also be allowed. Virgin Atlantic say bookings to the US, largely to New York, have surged 600% since the announcement was made. Delta Air Lines’ CEO, Ed Bastian, has predicted an “onslaught of travel all at once”, in November with queues likely at airports. Hotel prices in New York are also returning to normal levels after a summer where discounts abounded. Tourism industry experts expect this surge to last for a while. Tim Hentschel, HotelPlanner’s co-founder and CEO, told the Guardian. “The pent-up demand from overseas to visit the US will remain strong for at least several years.” Some form of travel ban has been in place since the start of 2020, Donald Trump issued the first proclamation that stopped most travellers from China visiting the US – with the list of banned countries quickly expanding. Land crossings from Mexico and Canada were also banned, although there were exemptions for green cards and some work visas. For many, that ban has only worsened the toll of the pandemic, further isolating people as family members fell ill or life teetered on the edge of what was manageable... Here’s the full story. Meanwhile in the cryptocurrency world, bitcoin rallied toward its all-time high on Monday and ether has climbed to a fresh record. Bitcoin is over 6% overnight to reach $66,357, approaching the previous record around $67,000 set on October 20. Ether - which underpins the ethereum network - has risen to a fresh record at a record top of $4,767.55 on Coindesk. Reuters says that “momentum, flows, favourable news and inflation fears” are all lifting crypto assets: Ether is up around 59% since the start of October and bitcoin about 51% as investors have cheered last month’s launch of a U.S. futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund and sought exposure to an asset class sometimes regarded as an inflation hedge. Falling real yields, as traders brace for inflation, adds to the attractiveness of assets such as gold and cryptocurrencies which do not pay a coupon, said Kyle Rodda, analyst at broker IG Markets, adding that the mood in the sector has also been good. “Financial institutions want to be a part of it, regulators don’t want to clamp down on it too much,” he said. “We’re almost past the inflection point, where it’s part of the system and its going to be very, very hard to extricate it.” In recent weeks, Australia’s biggest bank has said it will offer crypto trading to retail customers, Singaporean authorities have sounded positive on the asset class and spillover from a positive mood in stocks has also lent support.

That is up 21% compared with October, but remains 49% down on the pre-pandemic levels of November 2019. Around 3.8 million British nationals visited the US every year prior to the pandemic, according to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. A survey of 2,000 UK consumers commissioned by travel trade organisation Abta suggested that the US is only behind Spain in the foreign destinations that holidaymakers say they plan to visit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After more than 600 days, flights from the UK to the US are resuming today as the White House lifted its travel restrictions for fully vaccinated international air and land border travelers. In a major boost to the travel sector, thousands of travellers will set off on transatlantic flights from Britain, many for long-awaited reunions with family and friends that haven’t been possible since the pandemic began. To mark the occasion, rival airlines British Airways and Virgin Atlantic will operate a synchronised departure from Heathrow this morning to celebrate the end of the travel ban. Their aircraft will take off from parallel runways at the west London airport at 8.30am before flying to New York JFK, where there could be emotional scenes as people are reunited. Fully vaccinated travellers from dozens of other countries such as Ireland, the 26 Schengen nations in Europe, China, India and South Africa can also enter the US from Monday. The bosses of Virgin and BA said it was a “pivotal moment” for the battered industry, with both airlines having registered enormous losses and shed thousands of staff during 20 months of restricted travel. My colleague Gwyn Topham explains: The transatlantic corridor has in recent years accounted for the majority of Virgin and BA profits, and the airlines said the reopening of the US borders to foreign travellers, announced in late September by the Biden administration, would be a significant boost for the industry. Before the pandemic, 22 million people a year travelled between the two countries, along with 900,000 tonnes of cargo. Vaccinated US visitors have been able to travel to Britain since the summer, when the UK lifted quarantine restrictions, boosting passenger numbers, but the airlines are now increasing schedules and there are full planes this week for the first time. With both airlines deeply damaged by the pandemic – BA’s owner, IAG, is expecting losses of €7.3bn over 2020 and 2021, and Virgin has been on the brink of collapse – the pair will put on a rare show of unity after decades of bitter rivalry. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said it was a “historic event” and “marks a significant moment for the aviation sector”.

It also warned of long-term uncertainties in the market considered a “great hope” by miners. The report, released on Friday, came as the resources minister, Matt Canavan, prepared to visit India to spruik the Australian resources sector. He argued India has an “astonishing” appetite for Australian thermal coal that could support “three to four new Adani-sized coalmines”. But those comments appeared at odds with the conclusions of the government’s economic advisers: that while India and southeast Asia were seen by the resources industry as a “bright light” that could help sustain Australian thermal coalminers as industrialised nations pivot away from fossil fuels, the outlook in India was “finely balanced and uncertain”. “While India is one of the great hopes for thermal coal exporters, alongside southeast Asia, it also presents significant risk,” the first paragraph of the report said. “If India’s thermal coal imports decline, there could be substantial implications for seaborne markets.” These uncertainties were largely out of the control of Australian miners and policymakers. This month India announced a plan to cut its coal imports by a third, counting on an increase in domestic production and in renewable energy output. The growth of its domestic coalmining sector, and an increase in the uptake of renewables, were among the uncertainties cited by the chief economist’s report. “In the long term, the outlook for thermal coal usage in India depends heavily on the prospects for other energy sources, particularly the pace of expansion in renewable generation in India,” the report said. “India has set itself ambitious renewable energy targets. “The pace of India’s coal production growth will be the key driver of its future thermal coal import needs.” The report’s suggestion that thermal coal exports from Australia to India would increase threefold – cited by other news sources as evidence that Indian demand could “supercharge the opening of Queensland’s Galilee basin” – was based solely on the predicted increase from the under-construction Adani Carmichael coalmine. Demand for thermal coal is falling in north Asia – the destination for most Australian exports – and Europe and North America, and it is broadly expected this decline will continue in the coming decades. As demand slows, particularly in China, the benchmark thermal coal price has sunk to a three-year low: US$61 a tonne. The resources sector has repeatedly relied on International Energy Agency (IEA) predictions of growing energy demand for thermal coal in India and southeast Asia to offset reduced amounts sent to traditional export markets. The argument being pushed by advocates of the thermal coal sector, that growth in these new markets could support new mines – or a new coal basin – ignores the more dramatic shifts away from coal in developed economies, analysts said. Tim Buckley, the director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said: “The hope was that India and southeast Asia might provide something of a cushion [for the thermal coal industry] on the way down. But this isn’t a gentle slide to oblivion.” Buckley said solar power in India was three times cheaper than the assumptions used in the chief economist’s report, based on outdated IEA predictions. “They’re underestimating the importance of low-cost renewable energy,” he said. “Growth of thermal coal demand in India is financially challenged by the fact renewable energy is 30% cheaper, so what bank in their right mind would finance a new coal-fired power plant?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/15/almost-half-of-australian-big-business-moving-to-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T18:00:36Z","webTitle":"Almost half of Australian big business moving to renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/15/almost-half-of-australian-big-business-moving-to-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/15/almost-half-of-australian-big-business-moving-to-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Almost half of Australian big business moving to renewables","bodyText":"Almost half of Australia’s large businesses are actively transitioning to cheaper renewable energy, including many going off the grid by building their own generators and battery storage, as power bills threaten their bottom line. A new report by the Climate Council details the increased speed of a business-led transition to renewables as power bills have increased. The average household and small-business energy bill is more than 80% higher than a decade ago. Gas prices have increased threefold in five years. Sign up to receive the top stories every morning Many businesses – including 46% of large operations – have responded by seeking green alternatives. The Climate Council report, released on Tuesday, said the capacity of Australian businesses to generate their own solar power had doubled in less than two years. Business owners report making their investment back through cost savings in less than five years. The general manager of AustChilli at Bundaberg, Ian Gaffel, said the decision to invest in solar panels was a “no-brainer”. AustChilli employs more than 100 people in the agriculture and food manufacturing process. The business initially built a 100kW solar system and about 18 months ago added an additional 200kW. Solar now accounts for about a quarter of the business’s power usage. “We looked for many years at the idea before jumping in a few years ago,” Gaffel said. “We’re a growing business so as we’ve grown the energy we’re using goes up.” “My role is on the financial side and from the numbers it was a very easy decision. “It takes away that unknown of ‘what’s the power bill going to do next’. For us to be able to get some stability … and generate energy that won’t be subject to those fluctuations. Anybody who has the ability to spend on capital investment, it’s a no-brainer.” Gaffel said the cost savings gave the business more confidence and certainty when deciding to expand and hire more employees. The next step for the business will likely be battery storage, which will further decrease its reliance on the energy grid. The story is being repeated across the country, particularly in the manufacturing industry, where increased power bills have squeezed profits. The Melbourne-based Carlton &amp; United Breweries is moving towards 100% renewable energy. The company is adding a rooftop solar installation and has signed an agreement with a solar farm near Mildura to provide most of the brewery’s power needs for the next 12 years. Sun Metals, which runs an power-intensive zinc refinery near Townsville, is one of Queensland’s biggest energy consumers. To help justify a planned $300m expansion, the business is building a massive solar farm that will produce one third of its energy needs. The refinery will be the largest single-site consumer of renewables in the country. Greg Bourne, who is a member of the Climate Council and an energy expert, said businesses who transitioned to renewable energy to cut costs and take control of their power bills were also “playing a crucial role in transitioning the nation away from ageing, polluting and unreliable fossil fuels”. “This report shows that the rising cost of energy is the number one concern for Australian businesses over the next decade, so it’s no surprise that a variety of businesses … are all turning to affordable renewable energy and storage solutions,” he said. “This is a worldwide transition, with businesses around the globe taking advantage of the investment opportunities associated with renewable energy, with 131 of the world’s largest companies on their way to being powered by 100% renewables.” The Clean Energy Regulator said last week the government’s 2020 renewable energy target had effectively been met by projects that have been built, commissioned, or are under construction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/jul/11/electric-cars-could-form-battery-hubs-to-store-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-10T23:01:40Z","webTitle":"Electric cars could form battery hubs to store renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/11/electric-cars-could-form-battery-hubs-to-store-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/jul/11/electric-cars-could-form-battery-hubs-to-store-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Electric cars could form battery hubs to store renewable energy","bodyText":"A fleet of 35m electric vehicles could help the UK reach its net-zero carbon target by forming large battery hubs to store renewable energy, according to the country’s energy system operator. National Grid predicts that by 2050 millions of electric cars will use wind and solar power to charge up within minutes to act as battery packs for when the grid needs more energy. The grid operator’s long-range energy forecasts predict that smart charging systems will use algorithms to help cars balance demand and supply on the grid, while making the most of renewable energy and saving customers money. It found that the plug-in car fleet could hold a fifth of the electricity produced by the UK’s solar panels, which it predicts will quadruple over the same period. This scenario would make the UK’s ambitious target to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 achievable because it helps cut carbon from the energy and transport sectors, according to the report. Kayte O’Neill, National Grid’s head of strategy, added that electric vehicles will make the energy system more flexible and help bring down costs for consumers too. The forecast is one of five future scenarios envisaged by National Grid to help policymakers and the energy industry shape the future energy mix. In all scenarios the operator predicts electric vehicles will become the most popular form of transport between 2030 and the early 2040s. It also predicts that many more homes and communities will generate their own electricity through solar panels or micro windpower projects. There are fewer than 200,000 electric vehicles on UK roads, meaning the ambitious plug-in car forecast would require a major acceleration of plans for car charging and a step change in customer behaviour. The report said immediate action is required across the electricity, gas, heat and transport sectors “at a significantly greater scale than assumed in any of our core scenarios” if the UK hopes to meet its net-zero target. National Grid’s report also predicts that a net-zero target will require that homes use at least a third less energy for heating than at present and shift away from using natural gas in boilers and radiators. By 2050 at least 7m hybrid heat pumps, which partly rely on renewable energy, should be installed. The UK’s gas system should also be run on hydrogen, rather than typical methane-rich gas to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The warning comes in the same week that the government’s official climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, criticised ministers for delivering only one of the 25 emissions-cutting policies it had considered vital for 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/jul/23/680m-of-uk-foreign-aid-spent-of-fossil-fuel-projects-study","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-23T06:00:36Z","webTitle":"£680m of UK foreign aid spent on fossil fuel projects – study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/23/680m-of-uk-foreign-aid-spent-of-fossil-fuel-projects-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/jul/23/680m-of-uk-foreign-aid-spent-of-fossil-fuel-projects-study","fields":{"headline":"£680m of UK foreign aid spent on fossil fuel projects – study","bodyText":"The British government has spent £680m of its foreign aid budget on fossil fuel projects since 2010, according to analysis that highlights the UK’s failure to align diplomatic, trade and aid policies with the goals of the Paris climate agreement. Britain allocated more overseas development cash to oil and gas in the two years after signing the 2015 agreement than it had in the previous five, according to the study commissioned by the Catholic development agency Cafod and carried out by the Overseas Development Institute. Although the UK also increased support for renewables, Cafod said the continued support for carbon-intensive energy in middle-income countries was diverting resources that should be used to help poor communities gain access to electricity from wind and solar power. “The UK wants to be a leader on climate change, so it’s shocking that UK aid money is still being spent on fossil fuels overseas,” said Sarah Wykes, Cafod’s lead analyst on climate change and energy. “At a time when we are reducing the UK’s own reliance on fossil fuels, why are we spending billions of pounds saddling poorer nations with outdated technologies that will cause more climate damage? The whole point of development aid is to improve the lives of people living in poverty. The government needs to align its aid spending with its climate goals and urgently commit to ending all new aid for fossil fuels.” In recent months the UK parliament has declared a climate emergency and the government has announced plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Next year it is expected Britain will host a United Nations climate summit, where nations will try to draw up more ambitious plans to limit further global heating. But the Cafod study shows these efforts are not reflected in the government’s development policies. From 2010-17 the UK provided £7.8bn in financial support to foreign energy projects through a mixture of overseas development assistance, export credit guarantees and other official funding flows. The report says 60% of this total went on fossil fuels. Most of this came in the form of export credit guarantees by UK Export Finance. An earlier analysis by DeSmog UK, an investigative environmental journalism outlet, found an elevenfold increase in UK Export Finance support for overseas fossil fuel projects last year, including oil and gas operations in Oman, Kuwait and Brazil. The Department for International Development stressed that it has provided 17 million people with access to clean energy, but recognised the need to shift further from fossil fuels. “We need to do more if we are going to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate,” a government spokesman said. “As the prime minister announced at the G20 last month, in future we will look for the greenest way to deliver UK aid. Developing countries will be hardest hit by climate change. We cannot eradicate poverty without also protecting the environment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/sep/03/john-kerry-says-we-cant-leave-climate-emergency-to-neanderthals-in-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-03T05:50:58Z","webTitle":"John Kerry says we can't leave climate emergency to 'neanderthals' in power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/03/john-kerry-says-we-cant-leave-climate-emergency-to-neanderthals-in-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/sep/03/john-kerry-says-we-cant-leave-climate-emergency-to-neanderthals-in-power","fields":{"headline":"John Kerry says we can't leave climate emergency to 'neanderthals' in power","bodyText":"The former US secretary of state John Kerry has warned that humanity risks marching off a cliff unless governments take immediate action to fight the climate emergency. In a keynote address to the Global Table food and agriculture conference, Kerry made veiled swipes at the Australian government’s lack of climate and energy policy. He also weighed in on the heated debate about the massive Adani coalmine proposed for north Queensland. “We just can’t sit on our asses and leave the political process to neanderthals who don’t want to believe in the future,” Kerry told the audience in Melbourne. “We have a dearth of leadership, but this will turn.” The former US Democratic presidential candidate said it was not a choice between taking action on the climate emergency and securing jobs and growth. “They are not separate. And anybody who persists in putting forward that notion that you have to make the choice – you can either have jobs plus prosperity or you can protect the environment and the future. That’s a lie. “We’ve got a whole bunch of people running around trying to save the status quo – when the status quo is actually feeding a lot of jobs that don’t make sense.” He said the transition to carbon emission-neutral economies would create better jobs and noted that the fastest growing employment opportunities in the US were for solar power and wind power turbine technicians. He contrasted the growing US solar workforce of 300,000 people with the declining coal workforce of 50,000. Two years ago 75% of new electricity coming online in the US was renewable energy compared with 0.2% coal. “We have to make better choices,” Kerry said. He cast doubt over continued investment in the coal sector, acknowledging the controversy surrounding the Adani coalmine in Australia. “I got to tell you, we should not be moving to coal, we should not be encouraging coal, we should not be building infrastructure around coal,” he said to rousing applause from the audience. He talked up the future of small-generation nuclear power, citing its safe use by the US Navy. But experts have cast doubt on the technology because of cost, technical limitations and its failure to be deployed commercially anywhere in the world. Kerry said people arguing that the cost of action to fight the climate emergency was too great were not factoring in the massive storm and disaster damage bills. In 2017 the category five hurricanes Irma and Maria and the category four hurricane Harvey cost $265bn to clean up. “Wait and see what happens with Dorian,” Kerry said. He likened the money needed for climate action to the scale of the Marshall plan to rebuild Europe after the second world war. The Australian government has resisted calls to invest more cash in the UN’s Green Climate Fund. Australia has previously pledged $200m to the fund to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change and cut their own greenhouse gas emissions. “It’s to help those developing nations leapfrog the mistakes and get modern technology,” Kerry said. “We said we would put $100bn in that fund to help these smaller nations do this transition … But do you know how much money is in that fund? Less than $5bn. Come on, folks, that’s not serious.” He compared the global response to “lemmings marching off the cliff into the sea”. Kerry was critical of the Trump administration’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate change action pact but said state governors and mayors across the country were stepping up to the plate. The Global Table conference continues until Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/apr/04/australias-path-to-net-zero-emissions-lies-in-small-stimulus-friendly-steps","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-03T21:54:20Z","webTitle":"Australia’s path to net-zero emissions lies in rapid, stimulus-friendly steps","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/04/australias-path-to-net-zero-emissions-lies-in-small-stimulus-friendly-steps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/apr/04/australias-path-to-net-zero-emissions-lies-in-small-stimulus-friendly-steps","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s path to net-zero emissions lies in rapid, stimulus-friendly steps","bodyText":"Nearly two years ago, ClimateWorks Australia set out to test whether the implied goal agreed by world leaders at the Paris climate conference – cutting greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050 – was still possible in Australia. They weren’t certain it would be. They were pleasantly surprised by the result. “We found not only is it not yet out of reach in Australia, but it can be achieved using technologies that are mostly already mature and available,” says Anna Skarbek, the chief executive of the not-for-profit that was established in 2009 to fill a gap between climate research and action. Net-zero emissions targets have been adopted by 121 countries responsible for a quarter of CO2, asset owners worth $4tn and an expanding list of major companies. The Morrison government is yet to join them, having promised a long-term strategy later this year, but all Australia’s states and territories have net-zero goals for mid-century. ClimateWorks spent 18 months examining each part of the Australian economy in detail to consider what would be involved in getting there. The resulting report, Decarbonisation Futures, is an update of similar work in 2014. It found net-zero emissions were possible not just by mid-century but by 2035 – soon enough for Australia to play its part in an effort to limit global heating to 1.5C. The report lands as the coronavirus crisis has, in a best-case scenario, postponed 2020’s expected focus on climate change. The year-end UN meeting in Glasgow has been delayed until next year. It is considered the most important since Paris in 2015, with countries being exhorted to ramp up commitments as promised in the French capital. ClimateWorks’ analysis was completed before the pandemic hit, but Skarbek says the need to recover from the economic shock once the survival stage passes will also provide an opportunity to make the sort of investment required to respond to the climate crisis. The former will demand a substantial stimulus program. The latter requires an “all-in” approach from governments, business and individuals in what the report calls “the transformational decade” before 2030. After that, the window for Australia to do its bit towards the Paris targets and prepare for a coming global zero emissions economy may have closed. Skarbek says it means a “make or break moment” is coming. The good news, she says, is many transformational climate-friendly steps are stimulus-ready. “If we get this right, we can meet Australia’s international climate change commitments, create jobs in sustainable industries, and set ourselves up for a smoother and speedier shift to a zero-emissions economy,” she says. “If we miss the moment of the stimulus injection to also accelerate on climate, the downturn will make it even harder to do what is needed over the next decade. I do worry we might miss this chance forever if we don’t seize it now.” The report finds the progress and fall in cost of clean technology since the last analysis six years ago has been faster than expected, with renewable energy becoming cheaper than fossil fuels and the cost of batteries plunging 80% in a decade. It says much of the shift needed now could be rolled out quickly by rapid and large-scale deployment of familiar technology. It would include upgrading homes and commercial buildings to boost energy efficiency and run on solar power; building more large-scale clean energy plants and storage; installing electric vehicle charging stations; boosting the use of recycled goods in supply chains; and supporting more carbon forestry by planting and protecting trees to store CO2. “It’s a lot of relatively small transactions that get this job done,” Skarbek says. “That’s why it is stimulus-friendly.” The analysis found the difference between making cuts consistent with 1.5C and 2C of heating were noteworthy, but not always that great. The lower goal was likely to mean renewable energy providing 79% of power by 2030, compared with 73% for 2C and 48% if we continue on the current path without governments introducing further policies. On electric vehicles, a 1.5C path could require three out of every four new cars sold in 2030 being electric, compared with one out of two on a 2C path. The government has projected EVs will make up one in five new sales by then. Deployment of available tech to make rapid cuts in electricity, buildings and transport is easier than in heavy industry, agriculture and the land, but Amandine Denis-Ryan, ClimateWorks’ head of national programs, says there are emerging solutions in those areas. One may be hydrogen, which governments are backing as a potentially plentiful clean energy source for use in transport and industry, and to export. While the report acknowledges green hydrogen is likely to have a part to play, it does not assume how big that role will be, given it is a relatively new industry and there is little data to back it up. But Skarbek says it is a potential answer to two big questions: what can be done in those parts of the economy, particularly in heavy industry, that cannot easily shift to running on clean electricity? And what industries can fill the gap created by Australia’s reliance on fossil fuel exports? Denis-Ryan stresses the report reveals both what is possible and the urgency of the task. Achieving the Paris goals will require national emissions being cut in half by 2030 at the latest. “We now know we have enough technological capacity in the Australian economy to get there,” she says. “But we need to get these technologies out the door at every opportunity.” Electricity The analysis found electricity is key – getting to 100% clean energy will help clean up other parts of the economy. It suggests no significant increase in storage is needed to get from where we are today, at about 25% clean energy, to 50%. Pumped hydro and batteries are mature and available technologies for when that boost is required. Hydrogen may play a role, and demand-response programs, microgrids and inertia control technology are all considered at demonstration stage and could be rapidly scaled up to improve grid security. But the key factor determining the pace of the electricity transition is the speed at which coal and gas plants are closed. The analysis suggests over-building renewable energy to 200% capacity – double what the country needs – could be more cost-effective than building to 100%, and would spark new clean export opportunities. Buildings As with electricity, the technology for zero-emissions building already exists. It would involve improving energy efficiency through insulation and draught sealing and by installing LED lighting, solar hot water and efficient heating, cooling and appliances. It could mean the introduction of passive house design standards to conserve energy, the use of electrochromic windows that allow owners to control the amount of light and heat that passes through them, and smart systems that optimise when and how power is used. But much of it would be driven by a shift to clean energy, replacing gas-fired heating and cooking with heat pumps and induction stovetops. Transport Transport is not as easy to tackle as electricity and buildings, but the analysis found it could reach near zero emissions by 2050 through improving travel practices (using more electrified mass public transport and video-conferencing for business), shifting to electric vehicles and replacing fossil fuels with biofuels, and possibly renewable hydrogen and ammonia. Industry Industrial emissions have been rising rapidly in Australia, effectively cancelling out reductions in electricity generation and drought-affected agriculture before the coronavirus pandemic. They are harder to cut and would leave considerable “residual” emissions by 2050 based on existing technology. Improved efficiency, fast-tracking a circular economy in which metals, plastics and timber are recycled and reused and 3D printing plays a bigger role, electrifying mines and steel operations where possible, and shifting to renewable fuels are (to varying degrees) available solutions that could lead to deep cuts. Agriculture Immediate cuts are possible through better use of energy, including onsite renewables at farms, substituting some meat products for plants and better management of waste and fertiliser. Other changes such as using vaccines to limit methane from livestock, and shifting to lab-grown meat, are emerging technologies and need greater support for rapid rollout. Forestry Reaching net-zero emissions in the medium-term would involve expanding use of forests to store carbon to offset the sector where, based on today’s technology, the complete eradication of CO2 is not yet possible. But the report warns this is a temporary solution. The country cannot reforest land forever, and trees are vulnerable to bushfires, drought and heatwaves, which are exacerbated by climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/apr/28/tuesday-briefing-virus-puts-brake-on-housing-market","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-28T05:32:46Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Virus puts brake on housing market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/tuesday-briefing-virus-puts-brake-on-housing-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/apr/28/tuesday-briefing-virus-puts-brake-on-housing-market","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: Virus puts brake on housing market","bodyText":"Top story: Trump blames China again Hello, Warren Murray here with one part of your morning ritual. Almost 400,000 home sales worth a total of £82bn have been put on hold as a result of lockdown, according a property website. Zoopla says 373,000 sales have stalled since the end of March when ministers told people to delay their home moves if possible, and social distancing rules made valuations and viewings impossible. Zoopla says the market is “in suspended animation” and demand from new buyers has fallen by 70%. As a result it expects the number of sales over the course of the year to be half of 2019’s figure. Donald Trump has renewed his attacks on China, saying his administration is conducting “serious investigations” into Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and suggesting he would seek damages for the US. Over the weekend the president swore off giving daily briefings following media coverage of his suggestion that people might inject disinfectant. It didn’t last, with Trump returning to the podium on Monday to say: “We’re doing very serious investigations ... We believe it could have been stopped at the source.” After being saved by the NHS from his “invisible mugger”, Boris Johnson has made his highly anticipated but ultimately low-key return to 10 Downing Street and the political centre stage. He spoke directly to those pushing for an end to the lockdown sooner rather than later, saying it would risk a second spike of infections and a “new wave of death”. Ministers meanwhile have held a series of high-level meetings with trade unions and business leaders amid concerns that millions of people will be too fearful to return to work as pressure intensifies on the government to publish a path out of the national lockdown. New Zealand has ended its strictest lockdown phase and entered Level 3, with 400,000 Kiwis returning to work, takeaways open, and fishing, surfing and swimming permitted. Around the world more than 3,041,700 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19, according to the Johns Hopkins Tracker, and at least 211,167 have died.

The UK’s energy system has not used coal-fired plants for the last 436 hours, according to National Grid data, the longest uninterrupted period since 1882. It has happened partly because of a collapse in demand for electricity during the coronavirus lockdown and because of greater use of solar power. The UK’s previous record was set on 4 June 2019. All but four of the UK’s coal power plants have shut in advance of a government ban on coal generation from 2025. Since 2012 the average carbon intensity of the grid – the emissions required to produce one kilowatt hour of energy – has declined by more than two-thirds, from 507g of CO2 to 161g. * * * UFO footage released – The Pentagon has released three declassified videos that show US navy pilots encountering “unexplained aerial phenomena” and exchanging excited radio chatter. The videos had been circulating in unauthorised form as far back as 2007. The defence department said it released the footage to “to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real or whether or not there is more to the videos”. “After a thorough review, the department has determined that the authorized release of these unclassified videos does not reveal any sensitive capabilities or systems, and does not impinge on any subsequent investigations of military air space incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena.” The videos show what pilots saw during training flights in 2004 and 2015. The former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, from Nevada, tweeted that what has been released “only scratches the surface of research and materials available”. * * * Millions displaced before virus hit – A total of 50.8 million people around the world were recorded as internally displaced in 2019, forced from their homes by conflict and disaster. This is the highest number ever, and 10 million more than in 2018. The figures come from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Norway. The most displacements were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa amid violence in the Sahel and conflict in Somalia and South Sudan. Natural disasters in south and east Asia and the Pacific also displaced millions. Alexandra Bilak, the IDMC director, said it was too early to assess the full impact of coronavirus on efforts to address displacement. “If we’re about to plunge into a recession, of course it’s going to have an impact on the generosity of donor governments,” she said. “It’s going to be a really bad situation for everybody.” * * * Zoom call scandal – The Financial Times reporter Mark Di Stefano has been suspended after the Independent and the Evening Standard accused him of listening in on sensitive Zoom meetings held by senior managers telling staff about salary cuts and furloughs. In each case Di Stefano, a prolific tweeter with more than 100,000 followers, broke the news of the meetings on Twitter at the same time as staff were being informed. Related stories were subsequently published on the FT website and live blog. The FT has declined to comment. Coronavirus Extra After a string of studies that highlight the possible link between air pollution and Covid-19 deaths, Ian Sample hears from Prof Anna Hansell about the complicated relationship between pollution, health and infection with Sars-CoV-2.

Sport Efforts will intensify this week to find a way to complete the Premier League season, after the government declared its desire to see football back “as soon as possible”. Liverpool have postponed the expansion of the Anfield Road stand by at least 12 months because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The England and Wales Cricket Board has been urged to open up the Hundred to private investment – including equity stakes for counties and even Indian Premier League team owners – in response to the coronavirus crisis. Umar Akmal has been banned from all cricket for three years after the Pakistan batsman failed to report details of corrupt approaches made to him in two separate incidents. Formula One Group is likely to provide the financial backing to enable the British Grand Prix to go ahead behind closed doors this year.

The papers “PM: We’re moving to second phase of battle” – the Times today says Boris Johnson will detail a limited relaxation of lockdown rules, including the reopening of shops selling non-essential items and allowing small family visits – while schools will stay shut until June. The Guardian has “No 10 in talks to allay public fears over end to lockdown”. Others seem keen to drum up a narrative that lockdown is nearly over. “Time to fire up engines, says PM”. Well, he didn’t really say that, Telegraph – it was more along the lines that the engines will be fired up when it is safe to do so. “Not much longer”, enthuses the Mirror, while the Sun has “Turning the tide” – which seems more accurate – under a strapline that gasps with relief: “Boris back at last”. “Hope in sight: talks this week on easing UK lockdown” – can’t really fault the i there. The Express reminds us of the minute’s silence at 11am for NHS workers who have lost their lives: “In memory of their sacrifice”. The Metro leads with “£60,000 for families of lost heroes” – on the payments to those left behind. The Mail remains prosecutorial in its coverage: “Doctors’ PPE desperation” – it adds that “Failure to stockpile gowns and visors dates back 11 years”. We will close with the FT: “Sunak commits to shield economy from ‘cold turkey’ jobless surge” – employment support payments will be wound down rather than cut off abruptly.

RWE will close the Aberthaw B power station in south Wales at the end of March 2020 after half a century generating electricity from coal. The energy company, which runs one of the largest portfolios of gas power plants, said it had been clear for some time that the UK was a challenging market for coal generators. The UK used coal for less than 5% of its electricity last year, and went without coal-generated power altogether for over a week earlier this year, which was the longest coal-free period since the Industrial Revolution. Coal has been driven out of the electricity system due to rising taxes on carbon emissions, and will be banned by the government from 2025 to help the UK meet its climate targets. The shutdown of Aberthaw B comes after SSE said in June it would close the Fiddler’s Ferry coal plant near Warrington in Cheshire by the end of March 2020 because it cannot compete with the economics of gas and renewable energy. EDF Energy said in February that it would shutter the Cottam coal plant in September. The string of shutdowns means that by next spring just four coal plants will remain in the UK: the West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar plants in Nottinghamshire, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and two generation units at the Drax site in North Yorkshire, which are earmarked for conversion to burn gas. Roger Miesen, the chief executive of RWE’s generation business, said: “This is a difficult time for everyone at Aberthaw power station. However, market conditions made this decision necessary.” He added the company would complete a consultation process with the 170 people directly employed by the plant in the coming months. The Unite trade union called for an urgent meeting with the company to explain why the plant will close earlier than the expected 2021 shutdown. “The reasons given for the closure are economic – the plant has rarely run over the last few months,” said Kelvin Mawer, a regional officer at Unite. “However, the decision to close has come a lot earlier than expected.” Tom Glover, RWE’s UK country chair, said: “For nearly 50 years the plant has played an invaluable role in helping to secure the energy supplies across the UK electricity system and we are very proud of its flexibility and resilience.” The decline of coal in the UK’s energy mix has left space for the growth of renewable energy sources, which generated a third of all electricity used last year. The government’s official annual energy report revealed that low-carbon electricity – which includes nuclear power and renewables – was used to generate more than half of the electricity used in the UK for the first time last year. Doug Parr, the chief scientist and policy director at Greenpeace UK, said the shutdown of Aberthaw should encourage more government support for renewables to help meet the UK’s energy needs. Greenpeace has often criticised the government for blocking onshore windfarms from competing for government subsidies against other energy technologies after the Conservative manifesto ruled out more windfarms for England. Parr said ministers should “take the brakes off wind and solar power, which will be doing all the heavy lifting in the job of getting the UK to a clean power system”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2019/oct/02/turbots-testicles-and-true-tories-johnsons-speech-unpacked","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-02T13:52:56Z","webTitle":"Fish puns and testicles: the strangest moments from Johnson's speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/turbots-testicles-and-true-tories-johnsons-speech-unpacked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2019/oct/02/turbots-testicles-and-true-tories-johnsons-speech-unpacked","fields":{"headline":"Fish puns and testicles: the strangest moments from Johnson's speech","bodyText":"With Theresa May’s legacy of dancing, coughing, being handed a P45 and having letters fall off a promotional board behind her, Boris Johnson had a low hurdle to clear in his first speech to Conservative party conference as prime minister. Here are seven times he failed the task. Kangaroo testicles for Bercow Johnson may well have been the first British prime minister to use the words “kangaroo testicle” in a conference speech. In a segment in which he bemoaned people having more control over voting on celebrity reality shows than they did with parliament, he suggested that “if parliament were a reality TV show the whole lot of us would have been voted out of the jungle by now”. But, he added: “At least we could have watched the Speaker being forced to eat a kangaroo testicle”. In 2017, Johnson’s own father, Stanley, appeared in the ITV show I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here!, declaring before he went into the jungle that he did not “know that a lamb’s testicle is different from kangaroo testicle”. Konstantin Chernenko – who? Johnson is well known for his classical references, but it was the 1980s cold war era he plundered for his speech. Suggesting that the Scottish National party was trying to drag Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, unwillingly towards No 10, he cited the example of Konstantin Chernenko. He also suggested people look it up. A severely ill Chernenko was elected to succeed Yuri Andropov as head of the Soviet Union, and lasted only 13 months, during which time he could frequently not attend official functions. After his death, in 1985, he was succeeded by Mikhail Gorbachev. Mother knows best After a few weeks during which Johnson has had some difficulty with his family – his brother resigning, his sister suggesting there might be other motives behind Brexit – he revealed that his mother had voted to leave the EU. He suggested she was the origin of his one nation Toryism: “My mother taught me to believe strongly in the equal importance, the equal dignity, the equal worth of every human being on the planet.” Sajid Javid applauds himself Johnson dropped a quick unscripted “thank you, Saj” in the direction of the former home secretary and now chancellor, when he referenced the Conservatives’ plans to reinstate the 20,000 police officer jobs axed during the previous 10 years. This led to the awkward sight of Javid furiously applauding himself in the audience. Pulling the skin off a rice pudding In a section addressing the UK’s energy usage, Johnson said there were some days when wind and solar power were delivering more than half of the UK’s energy needs. He explained this was in defiance of the sceptics who had once said that “wind farms couldn’t pull the skin off a rice pudding”. The source of that quote? One Mr B Johnson in 2013. He also cited the pioneering work of the nuclear fusion research team at Culham, Oxfordshire. He was quieter about the fact that the work had been partly funded by Euratom, which Johnson has committed to leave by 31 October. Bus nut SEO strikes again Fans of the conspiracy theory that Boris Johnson keeps saying things like “model of restraint” or that he makes model buses to take control of the Google search results for “boris johnson model” or “boris johnson bus” got another boost today. Describing himself as a “bus nut”, Johnson trotted out the bus-making anecdote again as he announced an ambition to improve bus services. Corbyn in space If Bercow was going to end up eating kangaroo testicles, a worse fate awaited Jeremy Corbyn. In a section on planned space ports, Johnson suggested there was one “communist cosmonaut” he would like to “coax into the cockpit”, and later suggested figuratively, if not literally, putting the Labour leader into orbit. He also at one point claimed that Corbyn wanted to abolish the British armed forces, a rather inaccurate reading of Corbyn’s 2012 speech, which said: “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if every politician around the world, instead of taking pride in the size of their armed forces, did what Costa Rica have done and abolished their army, and took pride in the fact they don’t have an army.” Fish puns galore “You could see that one coming,” said Johnson as he floundered his way through a pun-laden routine, arguing that despite having “names like Salmond and Sturgeon” the SNP did not want to take control of Scottish fishing. “We want to turbo-charge the Scottish fishing sector; they would allow Brussels to charge for our turbot,” he said. Still, what with the kangaroo anatomy references earlier, at least his speechwriter avoided using the word pollocks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/mar/21/australia-politics-live-climate-change-global-warming-josh-wilson-aukus-nuclear-submarines-russia-china-xi-jinping-vaping-essential-poll-tiktok-social-media","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-21T07:38:23Z","webTitle":"PM condemns salutes at rally – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/21/australia-politics-live-climate-change-global-warming-josh-wilson-aukus-nuclear-submarines-russia-china-xi-jinping-vaping-essential-poll-tiktok-social-media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/21/australia-politics-live-climate-change-global-warming-josh-wilson-aukus-nuclear-submarines-russia-china-xi-jinping-vaping-essential-poll-tiktok-social-media","fields":{"headline":"PM condemns salutes at rally – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re going to wrap up the live blog now. Here’s what made the news today: The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has condemned people using Nazi salutes at an anti-trans protest in Melbourne on Saturday. Tasmania announced plans to follow Victoria in banning the salute. After a two-hour partyroom meeting, the Victorian opposition leader, John Pesutto, said he believes his Liberal colleagues understand his bid to expel first-term MP Moira Deeming from the parliamentary party room ahead of the vote on Monday. The anti-trans activist Kellie Jay Keen was drowned out by counter-protesters at an event in Hobart. The Coalition appears on the verge of backflipping on its opposition to the Referendum Machinery Act changes, with senior members including the leader, Peter Dutton, now favouring doing a deal with the government and supporting the amendments. Senator Jacqui Lambie says she thinks the government could deal with a “broken promise” on the stage-three tax cuts by playing the public straight. The Reserve Bank of Australia board meeting minutes from 7 March reveal the board will consider whether to pause rate hikes at the next meeting early next month.

Health experts criticise National party’s views on vaping Public health experts and doctors have roundly criticised the Nationals’ proposed vaping reforms, after the party’s leader, David Littleproud, said retailers should be allowed to dispense nicotine vaping products, but that sales should be limited to people 18 and over, and attractive packaging marketed to children should be banned. The Public Health Association of Australia CEO, Adj Prof Terry Slevin, said by being the only major political party in Australia that takes tobacco industry money – “at least $276,062 between 2015-16 and 2021-22 from Philip Morris Ltd, the Nationals have ensured its views on vaping are worse than irrelevant”. “It invites the community, and any serious policymakers, to see its pronouncements on tobacco and vaping to be likely to be influenced by the industry which seeks to continue to profit from ill health and nicotine addiction,” he said. Asked by Guardian Australia if he had met with tobacco and vaping industry representatives and lobbyists recently, Littleproud said: “We’ve met with everybody.” Asked if he had met with Australia’s leading tobacco control experts and public health experts, Littleproud said: “There’s a doctor, I can’t remember his name, that’s made representation to us. “But this isn’t about medicine,” he said. “This is about regulation.” Asked if big tobacco and the retailers they represent are experts in regulation, Littleproud responded: “I think they are.” In response to allegations tobacco companies are influencing Nationals policy and big tobacco donations are part of that influence, Littleproud said: “That’s a pure, petty political statement. “If they [public health experts] don’t want to engage in a constructive way, in an adult way about protecting children, then unfortunately, they’ve talked themselves out of the debate,” he said. He added that he was not aware of the situation in New Zealand where vaping laws that allow retailers to sell to people age 18 and above had led to an increase in youth vaping rates. “I’m not going to get caught up in what other countries do; the psychology and culture are different,” he said. “Each country is different.” Varroa mite cases on NSW Central Coast prompt mandatory monitoring of beehives in Sydney Fresh cases of Varroa mite infestation in eastern NSW have prompted mandatory monitoring of beehives in Sydney for the first time since the outbreak began, AAP reports. The potentially devastating mite was detected in six new hives across four locations including Mooney Mooney on the Central Coast, directly north of Sydney, authorities revealed on Tuesday. It takes the total number of infested premises to 137. An eradication zone, within which all beehives must be destroyed, now applies to Sydney’s northernmost tip of Palm Beach, according to a map on the Department of Primary Industries website. New rules also apply to any hives within a broadened surveillance zone, where officials will monitor and conduct inspections to reduce spread. The new surveillance zone reaches as far south as Hornsby in Sydney’s north, and extends to Long Reef on the coast. Other infestations were detected in Clarence Town, Mitchells Flat and Booral, which are all in the vicinity of Newcastle where the original outbreak was detected in June last year. The department’s Varroa mite response state coordinator, Chris Anderson, said the new sites have low mite loads, suggesting they are very recent infestations. The recent detection on the Central Coast, however, has meant DPI is now concentrating its Varroa response surveillance activities into the northern suburbs of Sydney, to ensure the infestation is localised and that there is no mite population in the area. DPI has also had to extend the eradication (red) zone west of Stanhope, and west of Bulahdelah, following the new detections on the mid-north coast. Republican movement to have male and female co-chairs to better reflect values The Australian Republican Movement has announced after a special general meeting that the organisation’s constitution has been changed to adopt male and female co-chairs. The co-chairs will be the Olympic gold medalist and former senator Nova Peris along side the former chair, Craig Foster. Meredith Doig was elected deputy chair. Peris said the change “reflects the value system of the ARM and the movement, one calling for access, inclusion and equality for all Australians in our constitution”. The ARM believes deeply in reflecting both the cultural diversity of contemporary Australia along with deep respect for its First Nations in our institutions as part of the unifying vision of a truly inclusive, reconciled and multicultural Australia. Queensland roadmap to low emissions ‘inadequate’, conservationists say A Queensland conservationist has slammed the state government’s so-called “low emissions agriculture roadmap”, describing it as “a terrible disappointment”. The roadmap reiterates the state government’s existing commitment to a 30% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050 - a benchmark that critics say lags far behind other states. The director of the Queensland Conservation Council, Dave Copeman, said the roadmap was “inadequate”, considering the significant proportion of emissions produced by the agriculture and land use sector. This roadmap has no targets for emissions reductions for a fifth of Queensland’s emissions. The fact that it came out on the same day as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a synthesis report detailing ‘a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all’ shows that when it comes to agriculture, the Queensland government is actively avoiding taking climate action seriously. Copeman also pointed out that Meat and Livestock Australia had committed to reaching carbon neutrality for the entire industry for 2030 about three years ago. “Minister [Mark] Furner is actively avoiding reiterating these targets and instead condemning Queensland to a future of increased extreme weather, which will be felt by farmers the most,” he said. The minister for agricultural industry development, Mark Furner, said the roadmap “will help Queensland agribusinesses thrive while they reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” Furner said the aim of the roadmap was to provide a “smooth” and “structured” transition “while minimising dramatic changes”. “But this is not a set and forget approach – we will keep refining the roadmap as over time we develop even more emissions reductions solutions,” he said. Libby Coker says she supports Aukus after raising questions in caucus The Labor backbencher Libby Coker has clarified she supports Aukus, after raising questions about the program during this morning’s caucus meeting. Coker said: The Aukus plan is important for our security, it responds to the challenging times we face and it will create thousands of jobs for Australian workers. It has my support. Victorian government raises trans flag following weekend protest Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has unveiled the trans flag flying above the offices of the Victorian government following the anti-trans protest that took place on the steps of parliament on Saturday. ABC members of media union call off strike planned for tomorrow ABC members of the media union have called off a strike planned for Wednesday but members of the Community and Public Sector Union will still walk off the job for two hours. Journalists who belong to the Media, Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance called off industrial action after management agreed to address their concerns about career progression and gender and diversity issues. MEAA and CPSU members were planning to strike for two hours on Wednesday. This is the second time in recent weeks a strike has been averted. However, members of the CPSU, which represents ABC staff including editorial staff in the content-making divisions, will go ahead. The MEAA media director, Cassie Derrick, said the prospect of a strike had focused the minds of management. The new offer provides pay rises totalling 11% over three years, backdated to October 1 last year, plus a $1,500 sign-on bonus. Management has also agreed to conduct a transparent audit of the gender and [culturally and linguistically diverse] pay gap, to fix the broken buyout system, and to put in place a new pathway for career progression for early and mid-career journalists. Australia’s freedom of information backlog revealed Evidence given to the federal court by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner shows that, as of last week, it was yet to resolve 587 FOI review requests submitted in 2020 or earlier. Forty-two of those reviews were lodged in 2018, half a decade ago. Another 220 were lodged in 2019. The remainder, 325, were submitted in 2020. Of the 325 lodged in 2020, about 80% have still not even been allocated to a reviewer within the OAIC. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has condemned the presence of people doing Nazi salutes at the anti-trans rally in Melbourne on Saturday. Albanese told Nova 100 Radio: People should be able to disagree without having really hostile, nasty relations. In Melbourne on the weekend we saw an anti-trans rally, which is really disrespectful of who people are, and then it was joined by a bunch of people who were essentially doing Nazi salutes and slogans ... That of course should be condemned by all Australians. There is no place in Australia for Nazi salutes, and people basically paying tribute to Nazis, who were responsible for the Holocaust. I sometimes think that politics needs to be civil and we need to learn from history. That’s why I condemn the actions there. [I don’t know] why people would attend an anti-trans rally in order to promote division – we saw from the whole Pride festival in Sydney, I think Sydney was enriched by that, it was celebrating diversity in Australia. That’s a good thing. Here’s our full report on the machinations of the Victorian Liberals over what to do about Moira Deeming. South Australian health authorities say six people have used the state’s new assisted dying laws to end their lives AAP reports six people have ended their lives using South Australia’s new voluntary assisted dying laws, authorities have confirmed The new laws came into operation six weeks ago after 17 attempts over more than 25 years to get legislation through state parliament. SA Health reported on Tuesday that 32 people had since made an initial request as part of the process. Among those, 11 permits had been issued allowing people to access the necessary medication. SA Health said at least six people had died after being administered or self-administering the medication. The assisted dying system includes a provision that people wishing to die must be a South Australian resident for at least 12 months. A terminal diagnosis and a life expectancy of less than six months, or 12 months for a person with a neurodegenerative disease, must be confirmed for a patient to access the procedure. The laws also require patients to show they have decision-making capacity and are capable of informed consent, and to undergo an assessment by two independent medical practitioners. They must have their request verified by independent witnesses and be experiencing intolerable suffering that cannot be relieved. A patient will be required to make three separate requests, including one in writing. SA Health also confirmed that 44 doctors had so far completed the mandatory voluntary assisted dying training, while a further 54 had registered to do so. The in-flight food wars Australians taking to the skies are still being slugged with stubbornly high airfares, but rather than dramatically lowering prices to attract customers, carriers are jostling for positions in the latest battleground in the aviation wars – the best inflight meal service. Qantas, which is still riding the wave of its record half-yearly profit last month, appears to be keeping the party going with Italian caviar. On Tuesday it unveiled its plans for “new dishes and larger portions across cabins”, and lots of seafood, even for those in economy. Celeb chef Neil Perry is still directing Qantas’ menus, which on international routes features Calvisius caviar, Queensland spanner crab and seared Glacier 51 toothfish for those in first class, “more substantial second” meals on long-haul Asia flights for business customers, and Cajun prawns for economy passengers. On domestic routes, Qantas has vowed to keep vegetarian options across its network even for economy passengers, following the uproar it caused when it reduced its offerings last year. The flying kangaroo’s appeal to hungry travellers follows the intervention of Rex’s (formerly Regional Express) deputy chairman, John Sharp, in the carrier’s menu. Sharp, a former Nationals MP, reportedly directed the airline to reintroduce scones with strawberry jam and clotted cream modelled on a Country Women’s Association recipe to the business class morning tea service. Pork schnitzel will also return to the business class menu, at Sharp’s request. “If you go to the pub or the RSL, these are very popular things. Nice comfort food,” Sharp told the Financial Review. “Whereas Qantas will have celebrity chefs, at huge cost, behind its catering, we don’t have anything like that. We’ll provide food that we know people like. It doesn’t read as well as the fancy words that are on the Qantas menu, but it’s really good, popular food and people like it.” Appealing to another demographic entirely is Bonza. When the budget carrier launched in January, its menu lived up to the “bogan airline” branding it is trying to project, with its trademark $5.50 “snag in a bag” selling out on early flights. Crikey editor-in-chief ‘made redundant’ The managing editor of Private Media and editor-in-chief of Crikey, Peter Fray, has been made redundant but will continue to assist the media company in its defence of the Lachlan Murdoch matter. Murdoch is suing Crikey for defamation and the trial is set down for October. Private Media’s CEO, Will Hayward, said Fray, a former editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald, had made a “huge and positive” contribution to the company in his three-year tenure. Fray said it had been an honour to work with and for the staff at Private Media and its contributors. “I have every expectation that Private Media will build on the hard work of recent years,” he said. “I wish everyone great success.” In November Fray apologised after he heckled the Gold Walkley winners during their acceptance speech at the gala journalism awards ceremony. He was stood down from Private Media following the incident and has been on extended leave. As the afternoon winds down, I will hand you over to Josh Taylor to take in the remainder of the day’s news. I will be back early tomorrow morning for more fun and games as this last parliament fortnight before the budget descends into what looks like organised chaos. Labor is still trying to get its legislation through the Senate, but so far no one is budging. But as we have said, these negotiations are slow – nothing happens and then everything does. Take care of you. Labor quiet on ominous IPCC climate report There has not been the sense of urgency from the Labor government that you would expect in response to this report. However, if it was the Labor opposition, you could just imagine how many words would have already been said on it. Chris Bowen has acknowledged it – as an opportunity to discuss the safeguards legislation. Here is a former Labor minister on the IPCC report: Dutton: Dreyfus’ attack is egregious breach of standards of decency Following QT, Peter Dutton claimed to have been misrepresented and gave a personal explanation against Mark Dreyfus’s accusations during question time: During question time today, the attorney general launched what in my judgment is an unprecedented and completely unfounded attack. And on a topic … with the highest sensitivity. I mean, if there was some foundation to his claim, if there was some shred of truth or credibility to what he had said then I would be happy to take the criticism, but it is the complete opposite … of what I believe in, of what I’ve practiced my entire life. I’ve been to many Holocaust museums and I find it one of the most emotionally difficult issues to deal with. When you read through the history and see the consequence even on people have Jewish faith today, and that somebody of the attorney general’s standing would seek to use this issue to his political advantage, I think reflects very poorly on him. And I bring that to your attention because I find it the most egregious breach of the standing orders, and the standards of decency in this parliament. Dan Tehan then tries to make a personal explanation on behalf of the entire Coalition, which he is given some time for, but not a lot, because personal explanations are for when you have been personally misrepresented, not for defending entire party rooms. Victorian Liberals leader says ‘vital’ party expel Moira Deeming Victorian opposition leader John Pesutto says he believes his Liberal colleagues understand his bid to expel first-term MP Moira Deeming from the parliamentary party room. On Tuesday morning, a bid to delay the vote over her future failed. Liberal MPs will on Monday decide whether Deeming should be expelled from the parliamentary party, after she attended a rally headlined by the British anti-transgender activist Kellie-Jay Keen where neo-Nazis were photographed performing the Nazi salute. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday afternoon, Pesuttto said it was vital the party dealt with the matter: I can say that they [colleagues] can understand why I feel it necessary to take these steps. Pesutto refused to be drawn on the future of his leadership if the bid to expel Deeming from the party room was unsuccessful. Deeming has vowed to fight the bid to expel her and says she has done nothing wrong. Both the shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, and the Victorian Liberal senator Sarah Henderson have demanded immediate fealty to Aukus after reports three Labor MPs had raised questions about the deal. Apparently, everyone is supposed to just accept a world-changing security and defence pact and the $386bn-over-30-years price tag, no questions asked, because … reasons. Today’s matter of public importance: Coalition attack lines The chamber moved on to the matter of public importance (a debate topic chosen by non-government members which is usually along the lines of “why is this government so terrible at being a government”) Today’s topic chosen by the Coalition: “The prime minister’s broken promise to cut energy bills by $275”. (They are missing the “by 2025” there.) But it seems dates might be a little troubling today – the motion has the date of 9 March. You know, a couple of weeks ago. I was a whole different person then. Paul Fletcher owns up to the error and the chamber moves on, but not before a few Coalition MPs send little grumbling messages to us in blog land about the mistake. Seems not all is happy in opposition land. PM and opposition leader pay tribute to Rabbitohs great John Sattler Anthony Albanese ends question time. He then takes a moment of indulgence to offer condolences over the death of South Sydney legend John Sattler. Albanese does not need a speechwriter for this one: One of my deeply cherished momentoes is, and I found when I was moving house after last May, was my autographed book with a signature from John Sattler [from] 1970. When he went – as many sportspeople do – went to the local schools, St Joseph’s Camperdown, to present trophies, as those people do – you’ve got to remember, Mr Speaker, these people were paid almost nothing. They worked full-time, they had to work so hard. But he was greatly respected. He was deeply loved and he will be long remembered. I pay my sympathy as well to his family, including Scott Sattler, who followed in his footsteps and took a memorable tackle of course in the grand final for Penrith those years ago. I pay tribute to him today. And to a legend who bled red and green, or more accurately, cardinal and myrtle. Peter Dutton also pays his respects. Day of apology on forced adoptions ‘was a proud day for this parliament’: Dutton Peter Dutton speaks on indulgence: I want to associate the Coalition with the fine words of the prime minister. It was a proud day for this parliament that we were able to stop, to pause, to apologise and recognise and reflect on the history, the impact it had on generations of Australians, many of whom will still suffer today with those scars. The impacts on their own relationships, their own children, and their psychological impact just can’t be underestimated, and the work, as the prime minister points out, of many people in this parliament, but including prime minister Gillard as well as minister Macklin and Steve Irons … the then Scott Morrison, later to be prime minister – and many others who were involved in making sure the parliament dealt with this in a respectful way. There’s many who are still involved in that fight. And still seeking to make a connection and it is – it was a torture for them ongoing. We really respect those and we’ll have more to say on the topic in the parliament tomorrow. PM recognises 10-year anniversary of apology to those affected by forced adoptions Question time ends with a dixer on the 10th anniversary of the apology to those affected by forced adoptions. Anthony Albanese: Well, 10 years ago today on behalf of the government and the people of Australia, prime minister Julia Gillard said sorry to all those affected by forced adoptions. Tonight there will be a commemorative dinner at the National Portrait Gallery for those affected by these experiences. And tomorrow, the Minister for Social Services will deliver a statement in the chamber. Mr Speaker, the national apology offered on 21 March 2013 was an honest, humble, and long overdue acknowledgment of the harm and loss and grief and trauma inflicted on mothers separated from their children and children separated from their mothers. It hailed as we do today those affected, who fought so hard for the justice they were due. And it recognised as we do today those who did not live to see the truth told. Mr Speaker, prime minister Gillard’s speech also dealt with what drove and allowed that separation. In Julia’s words, holding the mirror to ourselves. Reflecting on the imagined moral superiority, that inflicted its judgment and cruelty on vulnerable people. Today, again, we remember their suffering and loss. We reflect on a culture that enabled and facilitated the practice of denying mothers even a single moment with the baby they had brought into the world. As prime minister Gillard said, they did not see their baby’s face, they couldn’t hear his or her first cries. They could not give their own baby a name. And this is not ancient history. Not some distant tower from the vanished past. The Australians affected are with us still, from two generations: mothers who, through the years, paused in quiet moments to think of a child who will be taking her first steps, or waving at the gate for his first day of school, or beaming proudly on graduation day; and children who were left uncertain as to how their path on life’s journey began. Mr Speaker, today, a decade on, we pay tribute to all those who, in the face of decades of callous indifference, demanded that the people of Australia apologise for the harm done in their name. We remember those whose lives were cut short, who did not live to witness that moment of healing. We salute the leadership of Julia Gillard and the advocacy of Jenny Macklin and those such as Steve Irons, who played such an important role in those events of 10 years ago. And we vow to heed the lessons of this chapter, in our nation’s history, to reach for empathy, humility, and humanity, before we leap to judgment. And to remember that strength in leadership is not defined simply by the exercise of power, strength is about accountability and telling the truth, even when that truth isn’t comfortable or hard to bear. Long may Australia remember this anniversary, that will be commemorated this evening with the dinner, and then we in the parliament tomorrow will commemorate it across both sides of this chamber. But long may we honour those who, even though it was so difficult for them, gave us one of the finest moments in this parliament’s history. Michelle Rowland says new funding opened to fix regional and rural mobile black spots Helen Haines has the next question and Milton Dick is still trying to settle down the chamber after the blowup over the last one. He says the next person to interject will be booted. The MPs settle down, but not happily. Haines: My constituents battle with poor phone reception every day. Last weekend, people attended the motor festival and struggled to get access. An emergency coordinator said if there was an emergency, what would we have done? Can you guarantee that with the mobile black spot program that opened yesterday, critical black spots in regional and rural Australia like this will be fixed? Michelle Rowland: I thank the member for Indi for her question and she of course is a very strong advocate in terms of ensuring that her constituents have equitable levels of communications as compared to their metropolitan cousins. And the member raises two very critical issues – the first is in terms of public health and safety, when it comes to communications. And that of course is paramount, as more and more people rely on mobile communications, it’s never been more important. Secondly, in terms of the tourism and other small and microbusiness opportunities that the best mobile services and also broadband services of course can provide. And I’m aware she is acutely interested in these issues. I’m very pleased to inform her, as she rightly points out, yesterday applications opened for two new funding programs of $150 million of federal co-investments, that includes for mobile black spots. Irrespective of where you live … everyone deserves the best accesses to communication services. So in particular, in relation to the member’s question, the mobile black spot and regional connectivity grants unleash new opportunities for mobile infrastructure in remote and very remote parts of Australia, particularly – as I’m sure many other members will be interested in – First Nations communities, because they offer additional financial solutions targeting these very underserved areas. This is in response to feedback that previous schemes did not provide enough incentive for this. So the guidelines that we consulted on from December last year to February this year really sought to improve a number of those elements that had been lacking in previous rounds. Applications are open until 31 May, and I encourage mobile network operators, communities, and other interested parties, including all members of this place, with rural and regional representation, to work together during what we call the application development period, to devise multi carrier solutions. One of the real frustrations in regional Australia is the patchwork of coverage depending on carrier. Under the previous rounds, under the former government, only 8% of the mobile black spot program towers actually provided support to more than one carrier. We have changed the incentives in the guidelines, so that this is substantially improved. The guidelines in this round emphasise that support for multi-carrier outcomes to ensure that communities receive the maximum benefit from that public funding. And these programs of course provide part of the most significant regional telecommunications investment packages since the inception of the NBN, and the Albanese government’s better connectivity plan for regional and rural Australia providing more than $1.1 billion to regional communities and I look forward to the member’s full participation in this program. Anti-trans event in Hobart drowned out by peaceful protesters Kellie Jay Keen has not had a great time in Hobart, where peaceful protesters drowned out her messages. The “national tour” is continuing and is meant to hit out the front of the Canberra parliament on Thursday, putting the onus on MPs to speak up right on their doorstop. There are fears within the moderate wings of the Coalition that some of the usual suspects (they mean the Senate mostly) will try to make a point by attending the rally. It’s all a bit of a mess, really. Ooft. Peter Dutton is furious as he takes to his feet. He has asked to speak on indulgence, but you can almost taste how angry he is. Dutton: I want to join with the attorney general in the remarks that he’s made so far as they go to condemnation of any use of Nazi symbols of the salute, of any glorification of that period of history. I would support any legislation in this parliament that you choose to move, noting you have not chosen to move any legislation … to make illegal in our country the display of any aspect of Nazi glorification. I have been in this place for 22 years, you can look at my history in any comment I made in making sure we never repeat the mistakes of history, especially during that period. And the slaughter – the slaughter of Jews and the treatment by the Nazis of people during the second world war, the treatment today of people of the Jewish faith is an abomination. It is equally condemned that it would be used for political purposes in this place, it is a very poor reflection on you, if I might say. As minister for home affairs and as the minister for defence, as a member of the national security committee, I supported every decision – in fact, encouraged, to the nth degree – the director general of Asio to use every resource at his disposal to make sure that those who seek to propagate this to be prosecuted under the law. And I won’t take a morals lecture from that man [Dreyfus] or indeed, that one [Anthony Albanese] He should get up and make a statement himself. Dreyfus accuses Dutton of ‘complete silence’ over Nazi rally and Moira Deeming If the prime minister has made a statement on the neo-Nazi salutes on the stairs of the Victorian parliament, during anti-trans rights activist Kellie Jay Keen’s “rally” I have missed it. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, makes a statement though, through a dixer. Josh Burns asks: My question is to the attorney general. Why is it important to condemn public displays of right-wing extremism and Nazi symbolism? Dreyfus: I thank the member for Macnamara for his question. I acknowledge his recent statements on this matter. What we saw on the steps of the Victorian parliament, on the weekend, was abhorrent. There is no place in Australian society for public displays of Nazi symbols or the Nazi salute. These are markers of some of the darkest days in world history, of ghettos, of deportations, and mass murder that touched my own family. Six million Jews perished in the Holocaust. We must never ever forget. And thousands of Australian service men and women died fighting the Nazi regime. Sadly, the sort of behaviour we saw on the weekend and its accompanying antisemitism is on the rise in Australia, and around the world. The Victorian government was swift in its response, the Premier condemned the behaviour of a group of cowardly black-clad men who travelled to Melbourne’s CBD seeking notoriety. The Victorian Attorney-General pledged to reform Victorian law to ban displays of the Nazi salute. And when it was revealed that Victorian Liberal MP Moira Deeming had attended the protest, the Victorian opposition leader announced he would move to expel Moira Deeming from the Liberal Party. What did we have from those opposite? In particular, their leader? Complete silence, Mr Speaker. We all know that bigotry and hatred breed in silence. There are interjections from the opposition. Paul Karp hears Melissa Price say “what for” when Dreyfus speaks of expelling Deeming and “what did she do wrong?” Dan Tehan has a point of order: Point of order. What the attorneygeneral has said is absolutely false. It is not a point of order. Dreyfus continues: The leader of the opposition has failed to join his Victorian counterpart and [taken] action to expel Moira Deeming from the party. He failed to condemn the display of the Nazi salute. Why? What is so hard about this? Who is the opposition leader afraid of offending here? Maybe it’s Senator Antic, who said in the Senate yesterday that Moira Deeming did nothing wrong. For the leader of a party of government to not even condemn the public use of the Nazi salute is astonishing and it’s shameful. The leader of the opposition is the most senior Liberal in Australia. Moira Deeming is one of his own and he’s been silent and done nothing. This speaks volumes about the leadership qualities of the leader of the opposition. And Australians will take note. Independent MP Zali Steggall gets the next crossbench question: Methane is 80 times more potent in capturing heat CO2 in the first 20 years. Yet Australia doesn’t enforce international best practice when it comes to measure of capture. Will you support international best practice as I have proposed in the safeguard mechanism. In the light of the dire and clear warning in the latest IPCC report we’re on track to catastrophic warming? Chris Bowen: I thank the honourable member for her question. And indeed, the IPCC report today does call for urgent, substantial and sustained emissions reduction, methane and all the carbon gases, all of them. That’s exactly what the government intends to do. To lock in...(the opposition interjects) Honourable members opposite may not like reducing emissions, but that’s what the Australian people have voted for and that’s what the world demands, Mr Speaker. That’s what the world demands and what future generations demand and that’s exactly what we’ll do. Because, Mr Speaker, what the IPCC report today reminds us is there’s agency and urgency. There’s still time to hold the world as close as possible to 1.5 degrees, but we don’t have long, we must act. And this week the Parliament can act. Because in 100 days the safeguard mechanism reforms can be in place if the Parliament approves it. This is the most important opportunity we have, 205 million tonnes of emissions removed from the atmosphere. I know the honourable members have raised fossil fuels and resource. Today as we speak, emissions from fossil fuel facilities are 73 million tonnes a year. Business as usual with no reforms, they’re projected to grow to 83 million tonnes a year. But if the reforms pass, it will be net 52 million tonnes, Mr Speaker. That’s the choice the Parliament has. 83 million or 52 million. That’s the choice the Parliament has this week and next week. I will say this, last year the Parliament passed the government’s climate change act. And I thank members of the cross bench, all of them who supported it. And in the other place. This was important. Someone honourable members opposite say 43 is not enough. I understand that and respect that. I respect their point of view. I thank them for coming together in goodwill to pass that. But know this - our projections are very clear. If the safeguard mechanism reforms are not passed, 43% will not be met. Our projections show it will be 35%, Mr Speaker. So if honourable members are going to call for higher targets, they are obliged to vote for action to get those targets achieved, Mr Speaker. That’s the obligation on the members, you can’t call for higher targets and then... Milton Dick tells him to get back to the question Bowen: I want to see all carbon emissions reduced. I want to see the safeguards mechanism passed. There won’t be any constraints on methane if it doesn’t pass. The honourable member is correct, methane is a very important gas for us to measure and work with industry to see emissions reduced. That’s very important. If there’s good faith suggestions I have and will continue to listen to them. But the most important thing is that these reforms pass or it will be business as usual and business as usual is not acceptable. Albanese quotes Dutton in response to cost of living question Karen INCENSED Andrews has the next question. The former home affairs minister (or at least one of them) is slowly perfecting the art of being VERY incensed every time she steps up to the microphone. The character development has been subtle, but real ones know. I refer to a constituent who had to take a second job and cancel his children’s swimming lessons as his mortgage repayments are expected to almost double. He says that rising grocery, energy and other price increases are a massive stress on top of the anticipated rate rise. Where is the government’s promised plan to ease cost of living? Anthony Albanese, who seems to have gotten a full night’s sleep given that every opposition MP gets the little treat of a personal sledge, says: Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for her question. And I thank her for her interview on Sky, I think it was – it usually is … where the member blamed me for the fact that two people were appointed in her portfolio without letting her know while she was the Minister for Home Affairs. While she was the Minister for Home Affairs. I say to the member, hang in there. You never know what might happen. I say in terms of interest rates, that – and the cost of living, that the member asked for – I know she’s very loyal to the leader of the opposition*, I will quote him: ‘Nobody wants to see interest rates go up but it’s a reality of a world where there’s inflation. I think Australians understand that. There’s a lot of pressure, upward pressure.’ That’s what the leader of the opposition said at that point in time. So, obviously he had the confidence of the prime minister at that point in time. On the occasion, he was right in a moment of honest reflection as to what was happening in the economy. We understand there’s pressures on … cost of living. We understand that. That’s why the member for McPherson should have voted for the energy price relief, should have supported the fee-free Tafe plan, should have supported the cut to pharmaceutical costs, should have supported the measures this government is doing to take pressure off the cost of living. *I think this is a small dig to Queensland politics from 2009 when Dutton tried to switch to the seat of McPherson after the sitting member retired, but was beaten for preselection by Andrews. Catherine King highlights history of ‘rorting’ in reply to question over wait for regions fund guidelines Former, former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack gets a question – what a day! My question is to the [minister] for regional development, local government and territories. It’s been 10 months since the federal election and five months since the budget. Why haven’t local councils be given the eligibility criteria for Labor’s growing regions fund? Is this another broken promise to Australians? Catherine King: Thanks very much to the shadow minister for his question. I know, like all regional Australians, we are very keen to represent our regions. As you know, the growing regions program is part of this government’s measures of integrity and bringing integrity back into the grants program after years and years of pork barrelling and rorting on the part of the former government. So, we’re taking our time to make sure that the guidelines are the best they can possibly be. We’re undertaking consultation currently with the regional development sector and I will have more to say about the announcement and opening of the program shortly. This is why staff usually phonetically sound out names and places: PM refers to Paul Fletcher as ‘wambulance’ In a dixer about the safeguard mechanism, Anthony Albanese says: Business wants certainty. And that’s why they want the safeguard mechanism to be carried. How do we do that? We need the mechanism that was in fact put in place originally by the former government. But not only are they so committed to saying no to everything and becoming a no-alition, they’re saying no to their own policies. Paul Fletcher steps up to have that addressed, but Milton Dick is already on it: I will ask the prime minister to refer to the Coalition as the Coalition. Albanese points to Fletcher: The wambulance raced up there. Milton Dick threatens to eject Angus Taylor after pressing on inflation question And now we get to Angus Taylor who asks the prime minister (there is one last dramatic groan from a committed member of the Labor backbench, but the caucus seems to have abandoned this little bit of performance art. It has been 10 months today. It’s enough.) Taylor: Can the prime minister confirm around half of fixed-rate mortgages will end this year? With these interest rate rises, an Australian family with a $500,000 mortgage will need to find an extra $920 every month just to keep up with repayments. Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor? Anthony Albanese: I thank the member for Hume for his question. Question four. As predicted. [He is referencing that the Coalition does its questions in the same order of MPs nearly every QT.] The member asks about interest rates. And a number – and a number of questions today and yesterday, and previous sitting weeks, I’m asked about what happened … – as if the circumstances changed completely before the election and after the election. But this is what his leader, his leader said before the election: ‘We know where these pressures are coming on. We know the pressures of rising cost of living, the pressures on interest rates are coming from not just the war in Ukraine, that’s caused an energy price shock, the likes of which we have not seen for many decades. But secondly, the disruptions to supply chains, now that’s coming from the pandemic. We’re still feeling the effects of the rather extraordinary economic times that we’re living in.’ That was the member for Cook, just before the election, less than a month before the election. But the member would have Australians believe, watching this, that it was all hunky dory, there was no inflation, there was no supply chain issues, until there was a change of government. But it’s just not true. It’s just not true, as he himself said as recently as last September. Where he spoke about interest rates bucking decades of downward trends, and spoke about the inflationary environment. But he says one thing in here and a different thing … Taylor gets up and Dick says the PM’s answer is in order before Taylor starts: Yeah, relevance. The question was very specific, why do Australians pay more under Labor? Tony Burke is up on his feet almost before Taylor finishes speaking: Mr Speaker, just a point of order, it’s a deliberate abuse. An absolute deliberate abuse … If you want to specify where you think something is not being relevant, you specify where you think … Simply running a slogan for a second time … Taylor is told he’ll be booted if it happens again. Albanese: Thanks, Mr Speaker. And yesterday the member for Hume said that, said that half of mortgages would - would change. Today, he’s just all over the shop. And the truth … is that the changes to interest rates began on their watch. The inflationary … The inflationary pressures had been there in the economy for a period of time, building up, due to, as the former prime minister said, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and also - and also the supply chain issues that emerged from the pandemic. They just want to wish those away. But you can’t just wish these things away. You need to act on them. And that’s why my government is acting on them. Michelle Rowland: Labor considering options for online gambling changes We go back to rah-rah Aukus (20,000 jobs really doesn’t seem like much, does it?) and then it is to the crossbench where Rebekha Sharkie asks Michelle Rowland: Australians lose more than $25 billion a year to gambling. This harm is exacerbated by the use of credit cards for online gambling, meaning that Australians are gambling with borrowed money. When will you ban credit card use in online gambling? Rowland: I thank the member for her question and acknowledge her ongoing advocacy in this area. The focus of the Albanese government, as with all kinds of harms in this area, is harm minimisation. That’s why we are taking an evidence-based approach to by the most reliable evidence as it arises through the current House of Representatives standing committee inquiry into these very issues. I would point out to the member that in addition to the issue of credit cards which has been considered widely, and also has been the subject of several inquiries, we are currently considering the options that are available. We have long engaged with the banking sector, with various advocates and including our regulators, in terms of what measures can be taken for amendments in this area, which will provide the necessary levels of harm minimisation. I expect to say more on that very soon. But I wish to assure the member not only are we are very alive to this, we’re implementing the recommendations and that framework that is currently there in relation to consumer protections. … We’ve consistently revised advertising measures come into place. I’m working very closely, including with my colleagues and the minister for social services, who has shared responsibility in this area, including my colleagues in relation to Treasury matters as they relate to banks, to bring about meaningful change in this area to ensure the harm minimisation objects are well realised. We’ll have more to say on this very soon and I look forward to engaging with her as we take this forward. After some more rah-rah Aukus, we get to Sussan Ley: Can the prime minister advise the house of the following, what the interest rate was 10 months ago, compared to today, how much the average household electricity bill was... Mr Speaker, the member for Sydney is shrieking so loudly I cannot hear. Milton Dick has had enough and borrows some of Karen Andrews’ incensed energy to tell the chamber to shut it. Ley starts again: My question is to the prime minister. Can the prime minister advise the House of the following: what the interest rate was 10 months ago, compared to today, how much the average household electricity bill was, 10 months ago, compared to today. And, what the rate of inflation was, 10 months ago, compared to today. Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor? Anthony Albanese: Well, I almost feel like channelling the member for Melbourne at this point in time*. It’s got to be said, Mr Speaker. Because, the childishness of those opposite just show day after day their incapacity to be a genuine alternative government for the country. Because, the fact is, the fact is – that inflation is a global phenomenon. That has led to an increase in costs, including – which began on their watch. Began on their watch. With the first of the interest rate increases. And, since then, of course, we continue to have the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we continue to have inflationary pressure on the economy. But those opposite, those opposite have voted against every single measure that has been aimed at providing assistance. *It’s a reference to “Google it”. They voted against the $1.5 billion in direct bill relief that we put in. Ley has a point of order, but Dick warns her it better be serious because the PM is on topic. Ley: Mr Speaker, I know numbers aren’t the prime minister’s strong suit … And she’s gone! Faster than my grandmother could throw her slipper at my father when he took his cheekiness too far, Dick sends Ley out of the chamber. The deputy leader of the opposition has abused standing orders in a most grievous way and she will leave the chamber under 94(a). The prime minister will be heard in silence. Albanese: It would be a wasted one hour for the deputy leader because she can’t call caucus members against this bloke while they’re all in here. Dick has his metaphorical slipper in his hand as he tells the PM to get back to the question. Albanese: What this government have been doing is taking measures to put downward pressure on inflation. And the member asked a question about inflation some months ago, when they were in office. And I would ask them to give consideration as to whether the March budget they handed down was inflationary or deflationary. Did it contribute more cash into the economy, or less cash into the economy? Did it facilitate higher interest rates, or lower interest rates? Because what they did – what they did in the lead-up to an election – when they were so desperate, when they were so desperate, is promise a whole range of measures that all ended in May. Many of them – many of the measures they put in place, many of the measures they put in place ended on June 30 or next year on June 30. Ahh, he is out of time. The chamber seems very rowdy today, so hold on. Peter Dutton opens proceedings: My question is to the prime minister. The prime minister stated before the last election, and I quote, ‘If I’m given the great honour of holding high office as prime minister, I won’t seek to blame anyone else.’ Will the prime minister accept responsibility and admit he has broken his promise to provide cheaper mortgages and cut power bills by $275 per year, a promise he made on 97 occasions? Anthony Albanese: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Those opposite won’t take responsibility for anything they did when they were in government. Nothing. The fact is there was … there was a price increase for energy scheduled – scheduled – by those opposite; not only did they not take responsibility for it, they hid it. They hid it through a special regulation to make sure that Australian people can’t find out. Couldn’t find out. What others have said about energy … is this: the business council of Australia … (Dutton interjects) … Mr Speaker, he’s at it again. He’s at it again. He was supposed to be nice Peter. But he can’t survive ‘til five past two without resorting to the old boofhead. Ahhh, we are back to “boofhead”. Good times. Dutton: All I interjected was that can anyone trust a word this man says? Albanese: In between the interjections, the interjections from the leader of the opposition, he then stands up and asks a different question. A different question. Whilst speaking about integrity and responsibility and taking into account what people say. He can’t keep his word from one minute past two to two minutes past two. That’s what we just saw. That’s what we just saw from the leader of the opposition. But I’m asked about responsibility. The shadow minister opposite for home affairs had something to say about responsibility during the week. She was asked about the fact that they not only had one minister sworn in to her portfolio, she had another as well, because the member for Cook put in extra. She said this: … it’s not OK to behave in the way that a former prime minister and others have been, in relation to keeping information a secret. So far, so good. Karen Andrews is back to being incensed: Maybe he can move on and answer the question. That is not a point of order. Milton Dick is in a mood. He has no time for this today. The member for McPherson is a long term member of parliament. It’s the first question. The prime minister is in order. This behaviour continues, people will be asked to leave the chamber immediately without warning. Albanese: [She then said] ‘I think it’s just extraordinary.’ And it’s all stacking up so far – the shadow minister is pretty right – then she said, ‘However, I think it’s very disappointing that this information is coming to light now.’ That’s what she had to say. Then it comes to the responsibility bit: ‘And it does reflect very poorly on prime minister Albanese.’ So, [the former] prime minister appoints not one but two people in her portfolio, and it reflects badly on me. That says everything. That says everything about your incapacity to take responsibility for anything. He is out of time. Coalition on brink of pursuing deal with Labor on referendum changes as majority of partyroom in favour of bill The Coalition appears on the verge of backflipping on its opposition to the Referendum Machinery Act changes, with senior members including the leader, Peter Dutton, now favouring doing a deal with the government and supporting the amendments. Dutton and shadow special minister of state, Jane Hume, who have been meeting with SMOS Don Farrell, told the Coalition partyroom today that they were still in negotiations. But it’s understood the Coalition’s starting position in those negotiations is now in favour of an agreement. Several members spoke for and against the bill today in the meeting. Guardian Australia has been told that the majority were in favour. A partyroom spokesperson said a conclusion wasn’t reached, but that the leadership would take the discussions into consideration – and the partyroom might meet again on the matter. It’s understood that the partyroom noted that, if the Coalition doesn’t achieve an outcome with the government on the bill, that the opposition might get none of their preferred outcomes because Labor can deal with the Greens instead. One suggestion, potentially to be canvassed in coming amendments, would be a parliamentary committee to design the official information pamphlet. The negotiations continue and the bill - which was earlier expected to pass sometime today - might drag on into the night or tomorrow. Elsewhere in the meeting, Dutton signalled the Coalition would keep talking up about cost of living pressures, claiming these issues would get worse before they get better. Dutton accused the government of “knowingly deceiving” Australians before the election. Nationals leader David Littleproud talked about his party’s calls to change laws around vaping, making it easier for adults to obtain the products (as a tool to quit smoking) and harder for children. Andrew Charlton questions Dutton’s absence from NSW election campaigning The final 90-second statement before question time was Labor’s Andrew Charlton doing a bit on Peter Dutton and the opposition frontbench not campaigning for the NSW Liberals in Sydney, ahead of the state election this weekend. Charlton was speaking about the changes of “seasons” and watching regions turn “a lovely shade of red”. Labor was in hysterics (but honestly, this is a group of people who get excited over the word “boofhead” so not sure how much of a measure that is) and Charlton looked very proud of himself. But I am begging every politician who can remember the 90s to please update your pop culture references. Charlton finishes with a joke that he hears NSW Tourism is about to hire Lara Bingle to ask “Where the bloody hell are you?” of Dutton. It’s Lara Worthington now, and that ad campaign was released in 2006. In one more year, it could vote. Let it go. Liberal backbencher gives statement on being kicked off YouTube Over in the house, Liberal backbencher Russell Broadbent has given a 90-second statement on being booted off YouTube. Broadbent said he was quoting ABS mortality figures but that was enough to have him turfed off the platform. So I say to YouTube – why are you censoring an Australian parliamentarian for just reasonable remarks about ABS figures in this country? I mean, it’s totally unacceptable that an international company comes in here, you’ve genuinely upload a three minute speech on deaths in Australia, on mortality rates in Australia and you get kicked off. It’s unbelievable. Royal commission into Murdoch media influence would ‘stand up for truth and decency’, says Sarah Hanson-Young Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young is calling for more political support for a royal commission into the Murdoch family’s media influence. Hanson-Young will give notice in the Senate of the introduction of a Greens bill to establish a royal commission into the Murdoch media empire and the control and influence they have over Australian democracy. No one in politics is safe from the wrath of the Murdoch machine – that’s why this must be a multiparty effort to stand up for truth and decency in our democracy. Only an inquiry with the powers of a royal commission can get to the bottom of the issues in the Murdoch empire and media concentration in Australia. In the last few weeks, we have seen the power of legal proceedings in the US to help bring the truth about the culture and values of Fox News to light. But both the Labor government and the Coalition have said no to any sort of royal commission, so it is unlikely to get anywhere Coalition mulling support for changes to rules governing referendum The Coalition is reconsidering its position to oppose the Referendum Machinery amendments, with negotiations still ongoing with the government as some opposition members say they’d rather that Labor get their support than the Greens. The opposition partyroom met today, and a big focus of the meeting was about the machinery act, or the rules governing the referendum. The Coalition opposed the changes in the lower house this month, but a backbench push could see that position changed in the Senate. It’s understood that several members spoke both for and against supporting the bill. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, gave an update on the negotiations with the government, and said he wanted to see a resolution that was the best outcome for a fair campaign. It’s understood some speakers encouraged the Coalition to support the changes with their own amendments, noting that the government could instead negotiate with the Greens if the opposition refused to play ball. Negotiations with special minister of state, Don Farrell, went long into the night yesterday. The government, which was confident that the bill would be passed by the Senate today, are a little less hopeful right now – don’t forget that any major amendments in the Senate will have to go back to the House for a second vote before the bill is completed. It’s still short of Coalition support for the machinery bill, and we’re told there wasn’t any major debate on the referendum question itself today – but stay tuned. We are sliding towards question time so make sure you grab yourself something nice to get through it. Carbon markets have important role to play in decarbonisation, says Kerry Schott Over at the National Press Club, chair of the Carbon Market Institute, Dr Kerry Schott is speaking. Which should make the government happy, given they are still in negotiations for the safeguard mechanism, which will rely on carbon credits. That’s another nice little circle there. Schott finishes with: A safeguard mechanism isn’t going to fix everything. It is one piece of legislation, it is a relatively slender bill; it just simply introduces the safeguard mechanism and credits, mechanisms that are already there, but not without any credits for doing better than an emissions intensity target, and no real ability to trade and nothing to encourage people who are below it to get cracking. So it is very important that this relatively slender bill gets through. And I think rather than try and second-guess everything at the moment, which in a sort of policy move, you don’t know very much about, is the sort of path filled with dead ends. Please wait until 2026/27 and wait a little bit earlier, have a look at the tracking and see how it is going, make any adjustments that are needed, but at least we will have the policy in place and we can be moving forward, and industry can have some certainty about what is going to happen. And finally, I should say, as the chair of the Carbon Market Institute, carbon markets are really important, they have an important role to play they have an important role to play in the transition, and they will continue to have an important role to play for those hard to abate missions in the future. So Chris Bowen should be happy with that. But this is all happening in the shadow of the IPCC report which is sounding the absolute final alarm on the need to cut actual emissions, which carbon credits don’t do. They just offset emissions. Meanwhile, in Tasmania: Albanese says he can’t understand ‘why anyone would vote against’ housing plan The Housing Australia Future Fund was also discussed in the Labor caucus meeting. Anthony Albanese told the meeting that it was “beyond comprehension why anyone would vote against” the bill – a reference to ructions from the Greens that they might oppose it. The Greens position has some support from the rest of the crossbench who believe it doesn’t go far enough, and from the construction union, but Jacqui Lambie has indicated her party will not oppose the bill. Guardian Australia understands the Greens party room didn’t discuss the bill today, and will instead discuss it on Thursday after further meetings between Max Chandler-Mather and the housing minister, Julie Collins. Collins was asked whether delay could harm support for veterans’ housing. She responded the future fund bill is not the only thing the government is doing for them, but “any delays will delay additional housing” for that group. Government ‘will not stand’ for marketing vaping to children In Labor caucus the health minister, Mark Butler, was asked about the Nationals’ attempt to soften the laws on vaping. Butler said that vaping had exploded in the last five years, and the government needs to push back against the view it is benign. “It is not, it is directly marketed to kids,” he said. Butler acknowledged that there is a major black market developing. He noted the Nationals’ proposal is along the same lines as has been sought by the tobacco industry. The government is working on a suite of measures with state and territory governments. He said: The industry has found a new way to develop a generation of nicotine addicts and we will not stand for it. Michelle Ananda-Rajah rejects suggestions she is opposed to Aukus pact Further to questions raised about Aukus in the Labor caucus today, one MP – new member Michelle Ananda-Rajah – has pushed back at suggestions she raised opposition to the submarine pact. Ananda-Rajah, the new MP for Higgins, told Guardian Australia: “I fully support the government’s announced Aukus plan.” We understand she asked a question and was satisfied with the answer. As Paul reported earlier, there were questions raised in the party room meeting about how the $348bn deal will be funded, Australia’s relationship with the US and how to respond to questions about sovereignty, and about human capital and workforce. Ananda-Rajah’s office wouldn’t confirm which question she asked. PM responds to questions about Aukus submarine acquisition Anthony Albanese also fielded three questions from Labor MPs about the Aukus submarine acquisition, including from Michelle Ananda-Rajah and Libby Coker: 1. How the nuclear submarine purchase will be funded. 2. Relationship with the United States, and how to respond to people questioning whether Australia will have sovereignty over the submarines. 3. The third, from a supporter of Aukus, related to human capital and whether workforce could be taken away from the rest of the economy Albanese said that the $9bn over the next four years is fully offset (Karp: this is because it includes $3bn of cuts to be outlined after the defence strategic review), and that defence spending is need to be above 2% of GDP, and that Aukus will be less than 10% of the defence budget. He cited secondary benefits for manufacturing and jobs. Albanese said when an Australian flag is on the piece of equipment “Australia is in control”. He said that Australia has had an alliance with the US since John Curtin, and there are “very few” pieces of equipment that are entirely designed and built in Australia – but that has no impact on our sovereignty. On workforce, Albanese said that governments needed to defend the country, but would also deal with all Australia’s national priorities. *A previous version of this post listed Josh Wilson as raising one of the questions in the caucus meeting. Wilson was not one of the MPs asking questions this morning. The motion to suspend standing orders vote has been delayed until later in the day. The chamber moves on with its business. Parliament has moral responsibility to vote for emission reduction policies ‘even if they aren’t perfect’, Bowen says Back in the chamber, Chris Bowen says if parliamentarians want emissions reduction, they have a moral responsibility to vote for policies for emissions reduction “even if they aren’t perfect”. He says parliamentarians can not criticise the government for not lowering emissions if they vote against emission reduction policies. “That’s the choice before the parliament,” he says. “ … I feel some confidence the parliament won’t squander that opportunity”. ‘The government’s housing plan will see the crisis get worse,’ Greens say Meanwhile, on Labor’s housing future fund, the Greens’ Max Chandler-Mather says there are still massive concerns it will do what it’s supposed to do: It’s not just the Greens and the Senate crossbench who think the government’s housing plan will see the crisis get worse. Last weekend the Greens went out knocking on thousands of doors around the country to chat with people who are copping massive rent and mortgage hikes, asking them what they think about the fact Labor wants to spend $368 billion on nuclear subs, but can’t find an extra cent for renters or invest even $5 billion in public and affordable housing. The feedback from over 80% of the conversations we had across the country was crystal clear: The Greens should not support Labor’s plan that does nothing for renters, and will make the crisis worse, until Labor is willing to make substantial changes that include direct investment in more public housing and a national plan for renters. The vast majority of people don’t want Labor to gamble $10 billion of public money on the stock market, what they want is billions of dollars invested directly in building public and affordable housing, and a national plan for renters that includes caps on rents. We spoke to lifelong Labor voters willing to sign our petition calling on Labor to accept the Greens demands to invest $5 billion in public and affordable housing every year, we spoke to single mums already contemplating homelessness because they couldn’t afford any more rent increases, we spoke to thousands of people all insisting that the Greens refuse to pass Labor’s bill until they agree to the Greens demands. PM speaks on Indigenous voice in Labor caucus The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, spoke about the preparations for the voice referendum in Labor caucus today. Albanese illustrated the difficulties, citing three pieces of history: 1. There has been no successful referendum in 50 years. 2. Only 20% of proposals put by Labor to referenda had been carried. 3. Historically, there has been no successful referendum without bipartisanship. As part of making sure Labor can get the referendum over the line, it needs to “minimise scare campaigns”, he said. Albanese didn’t elaborate what that was a reference to – but it is highly significant in the context of a government decision on whether to add words to its proposed change specifying that parliament can determine the legal effect of the voice’s representations. Albanese is meeting the working group today, ahead of the referendum bill being introduced to parliament next week. The comment tends to indicate that even if making that change cannot win bipartisan support from the Coalition it could help allay some people’s concerns that the voice will result in excessive constitutional litigation or a feter on executive decision-making. Government refuses to support suspending standing orders to debate the IPCC report Chris Bowen is now speaking on why the government is not supporting the motion to suspend standing orders to debate the IPCC report. It seems to be because of the safeguards mechanism – he is saying that is in front of the parliament and that is where the parliament can act. Bob Katter is against the motion to suspend standing orders, but for the planet. He’s talking about crushing up silicon because it has something to do with solar power. He wants to see emissions reduced (I think) but doesn’t want to see the coal industry closed down. And now he’s angry about gas being given away. It’s giving “uncle by marriage is invited to Christmas” vibes. Larissa Waters has moved the same motion in the Senate. It doesn’t have the government’s support there, so it won’t pass in the House either. Greens react to IPCC report The motion Adam Bandt has moved: That the House: (1)notes the release of the sixth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change synthesis report on the escalating climate emergency; (2)notes the statement by the UN Secretary-General that there can be no new coal, oil and gas projects and Australia and other developed countries must phase out coal by 2030; and (3)calls on the Government to heed the call of the IPCC and the UN Secretary-General and stop approving new coal and gas projects. The Greens are moving to suspend standing orders in both chambers to discuss the IPCC report. Adam Bandt in the House says the first step in fixing the problem is to “stop making the problem worse”. Nasa ‘should fly an Australian astronaut’ Nasa’s head, Bill Nelson, says the US space agency “should fly an Australian astronaut”. “I’ll be going to Canberra this afternoon, and Pam and I will be meeting with the deputy prime minister (Richard Marles) and I hope if he’s back from the US, the prime minister (Anthony Albanese), to advocate exactly that,” he said. Nelson and deputy administrator, Pam Melroy, are in Australia for meetings about the US and Australia’s cooperation on space missions. This morning in Adelaide, they joined Australian Space Agency head, Enrico Palermo, to announce a new national Indigenous space academy. First Nations students will be able to apply for postings to Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California as part of a joint program with Monash University. Monash professor, Chris Lawrence, said he encouraged young Indigenous women to get involved. He said: I certainly want to see an Indigenous Australian female astronaut. That’s really what this program is about, and that’s what my ambition is, is to help find those people. He said First Nations people used the stars to navigate the landscape, engineering to create boomerangs, and data science in their storytelling. “Indigenous Australians are the first scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians,” he said. Melroy said: It’s particularly important that as we go out into the solar system, that we go as humanity. It’s critically important to us that we have the lens, the viewpoint and the stories in the history of all of humanity. Also discussed in the Labor caucus meeting: Government needs to ‘minimise scare campaigns’ on Indigenous voice, PM tells Labor caucus The Labor caucus meeting has ended – Paul Karp is at the briefing: The Reserve Bank minutes for the 7 March meeting have been released this morning, and while they provide insights into the board’s decision to raise its key interest rate for a 10th consecutive meeting, they are a bit dated. For one thing, we already had governor Philip Lowe’s debriefing the day after that rate hike, telling us a pause in rate hikes was getting closer. And of course, we’ve had three banks fail in the US since, including the Silicon Valley Bank, and this weekend’s forced absorption of failing Credit Suisse bank by its larger Swiss rival UBS. Markets may have steadied in the past day or so – pending something else surprising turning up. Investors, in fact, reckon there’s a one-in-three chance that the RBA will cut its cash rate 25 basis points on 4 April to 3.35%. Even so, the RBA minutes are worth noting, including the board members’ anticipation that the March rise was not the last one. [M]embers observed that further tightening of monetary policy would likely be required to ensure that inflation returns to target and that the current period of high inflation is only temporary,” the minutes show. Notably, they viewed the jobless rate remained around a 50-year low (and fell again in February), and that firms were operating close to full capacity amid strong business conditions. Productivity, meanwhile, had been stagnant for three years. The word “pause” didn’t appear in the commentary accompanying the 7 March decision but it does make a debut in the minutes. Members agreed to reconsider the case for a pause at the following meeting, recognising that pausing would allow additional time to reassess the outlook for the economy,” the minutes show. However, “at what point it will be appropriate to pause will be determined by the data and the Board’s assessment of the outlook”, so don’t bank on it just yet. Interestingly, the board took time out to address the issue of whether firms were using their market power to push up prices, as the Guardian reported here. Recent trends in company profits had attracted some public attention as a potential driver of high prices domestically,” it said. “Members noted that the national accounts showed that the mining sector accounted for most of the increase in company profits over the preceding few years, with profits in the non-mining sector being little changed as a share of total income.” The European Central Bank has lately raised its own concerns about inflation derived from excessive profits, so the issue is probably one to keep a beady eye on. Pesutto likely to succeed in his push to expel Deeming from the party room, Victorian Liberal sources say Just got confirmation from two MPs that at that lengthy Liberal party room meeting this morning there was a vote to put off next Monday’s Moira Deeming expulsion motion indefinitely. It was moved by MPs Brad Battin and Richard Riordan and defeated, 18 votes to 11. Liberal sources close to opposition leader John Pesutto have suggested the vote indicates he will succeed in his push to expel Deeming from the party room next week. Others are a bit more sceptical, arguing there are some conservative MPs who want the vote to go ahead only to vote it down. In any event, it’s interesting given Pesutto won the leadership against Battin by just one vote. The bells are ringing and the parliament sitting is about to begin. Here we go. Victorian Liberal leader, John Pesutto, has just emerged after a lengthy party room meeting following his decision to move a motion to expel Moira Deeming: I will say that the discussions we have inside are always robust, but they’re civil, they’re passionate. He’s asked about Liberal MP Ryan Smith, who told ABC Radio Melbourne earlier this morning he was not convinced that the 15 pages of evidence Pesutto has compiled has proven the allegations Pesutto has levelled at Deeming in relation to her attendance at an anti-trans rally at which neo-Nazi activists were present. On Ryan’s comments, Pesutto said: The main thing is that the party room deals with it. Ryan is a member of the party room, he’s entitled to have a view. Asked if the if will step down as leader if he loses Monday’s vote to expel Deeming, he replies: “This is an important issue to deal with. I’m confident that the party that understands why I’ve done this and that I have not taken the action lightly. But I do respect the process and Ryan is entitled to review like every member of the party. I’m going to let him have that. I’ll speak to you a bit more later on.” Deeming left the party room before Pesutto and did not respond to questions. Tasmania plans on following Victoria’s lead in banning the Nazi salute. AAP reports: The state government was coincidentally planning to table legislation this week that would ban the display of Nazi symbols in public. Attorney general Elise Archer said immediate action would be taken to amend the bill and incorporate the changes. It was deeply concerning to see the abhorrent actions of a group of protesters in Melbourne over the weekend and we do not want that in Tasmania,” she said. The use of the Nazi salute is offensive, distressing and a breach of our community and moral standards. I want everyone in our community to feel safe from these disturbing displays whether it be Nazi symbols or saluting, as they can cause hate and fear. I believe these reforms will be nation-leading and will build on our commitment to create a more caring community for all Tasmanians.” UK anti-transgender activist Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull’s “tour” of Australia continues with plans to speak outside the Tasmanian parliament in Hobart. Equality Tasmania has planned a concurrent sit-in outside Parliament House, with hundreds of people registering their attendance on Facebook. 80% of Labor voters want legislation that makes big corporations cut their pollution GetUp has commissioned polling on the safeguards mechanism and found that 80% of Labor voters want the legislation to require big corporations to actually cut their pollution (not just offset it through carbon credits). Key polling results: 61.6% of Australians think the Albanese government should work with the Greens and independents to make sure the laws require corporations to make genuine cuts to pollution. 80.3% of Labor voters agree. 65.5% of Australians think the Albanese government should not subsidise fracking in the NT with public funds, and should review all fossil fuel subsidies in the next federal budget. Labor leads the two-party-preferred vote with 53% The CEO of GetUp, Larissa Baldwin-Roberts, says the government needs to work with the crossbench to improve the legislation so Australians have faith in it. Parliamentary Friends of Clean Investment to hold launch event tonight Parliamentary friends groups are springing up all over the place – David Pocock, Karen Grogan and Andrew Bragg are coming together for a Parliamentary Friends of Clean Investment. The new Friendship group will provide a non-partisan forum for MPs and Senators to engage with institutional investors and companies that are accelerating the transition to net zero, identify legislative and regulatory opportunities to accelerate investment in cleaner technology and infrastructure, develop a greater understanding of the role of capital in accelerating the energy transition, and host events that showcase net zero investment opportunities. Supported by Investor Group of Climate Change (IGCC) and the Financial Services Council (FSC), the launch event tonight will include conversations with six super fund Chief Investment Officers, who are custodians of $1 trillion on behalf of 5 million Australians. ‘Labor must be more ambitious on social housing,’ says CFMEU The CFMEU also thinks the government could go further in its housing fund ambitions. Jacqui Lambie is in favour of the legislation, but she is concerned it doesn’t go far enough or will lead to enough social housing being built and so is negotiating for more. The CFMEU has similar concerns. Incoming CFMEU national secretary Zach Smith said the Labor government needed to go further in its ambition or risk the fund failing: Australia is in the grips of one of the most serious housing crises in our history so what’s on the table simply doesn’t cut it. Labor must be more ambitious on social housing. The future fund proposal needs its funding to be dramatically increased if we’re going to go anywhere near meeting the skyrocketing need for housing. This is a golden nation-building opportunity. We need to ensure this fund has strict requirements to train Australian apprentices and use high-quality locally manufactured materials. A more ambitious investment is a massive long-term opportunity for Australian jobs and industry but it needs to come with a commitment on local procurement and training. It’s absolutely crucial these houses are built by fairly paid workers who are protected by the very best safety standards. A housing future fund is a massive chance to build a stronger construction industry through top-notch jobs, skills, safety and local procurement. The government should be listening to the Senate crossbench – David Pocock and Jacqui Lambie are two of the most sensible voices in this debate. Meeting of Victorian Liberal party room takes more than two hours Antipoverty Centre questions need for cross-party group examining poverty There are a lot of “parliamentary friends” groups – which are research or study groups featuring politicians from across different political parties coming together to learn more about particular issues. A new one has been established to look at poverty. The Antipoverty Centre, which advocates for those living in poverty through the lens of people experiencing poverty, fear it being “yet another group that will do more to serve people who don’t understand our lives than us”. The group says it is time that people living in poverty were given the space to lead the conversations: We do not need more lip service to so-called lived experience, or organisations that profit from poverty selecting who gets to speak to politicians on our behalf. As the only social policy group led by unemployed people, it is frustrating that we have again been excluded in favour of wealthy people who do not understand our lives. It is the responsibility of all MPs who join this group to ensure that we and other organisations led by people in poverty have our voices prioritised in its work. People in poverty are experts and we are best placed to know what we need, and what you can do to support us. Greens senator David Shoebridge, along with Bridget Archer, Andrew Wilkie and Helen Haines, are co-hosting an event in parliament in about 30 minutes looking at the ramifications of the Iraq invasion, 20 years on from when the “Coalition of the willing” defied the UN and declared war on Iraq. The event will also look at current circumstances and whether or not we have learned anything from Iraq. The speakers include Abeer Abdulazeez, an independent Iraqi Australian journalist, and Dean Yates, a former Reuters Baghdad bureau chief whose Iraqi colleagues were killed in an attack by a US Apache helicopter, which was captured in the Collateral Murder video leaked by whistleblower Chelsea Manning. Details on how to zoom in, are here. Effective regulation needed to avoid domestic gas shortfall – Brakey And what does Brakey suggest governments do? Hit the gas trigger when it has to. One tool the Australian government has available to address the potential of a shortfall in the near term is the Australian domestic gas security mechanism [ADGSM]. As you know, the government has recently been consulting on changes to the ADGSM, providing the minister for resources greater flexibility in when and for how long to enact the mechanism. Effective regulatory tools, such as the ADGSM, as well as the heads of agreement and industry code of conduct, are needed to improve the way the market works and avoid a domestic shortfall. This is partly due to the commercial incentives at play; while LNG producers have capacity to supply more gas domestically, they also have the ability to divert that gas into the export markets as additional or spot sales. This has seen high prices in recent years that, at times, have substantially exceeded the cost of production. ‘Australia relies on producers making the required gas available’ – Brakey ACCC commissioner, Anna Brakey, continued: In times of tight global supply of gas, the security of supply has been impacted in a range of countries. Ahead of Europe’s last winter we saw calls for residents to reduce their electricity usage and discussions of the potential consequences of electricity outages due to a shortage of gas-powered generation. While Australia does not suffer the same harsh winters as much of Europe, this is clearly a situation we must aim to avoid. As you are no doubt aware, the ACCC collects data under notice from industry on their forecast supply and export demand and combines this with the AEMO demand forecast. These numbers change as we get closer to the period in question and there is more certainty. When we release our next report in coming weeks we will include updated supply and demand data. Over recent years, producers have committed additional gas to the domestic market over time to avoid the predicted shortfall. The options available to meet demand in the short term are otherwise limited. Australia relies on producers making the required gas available. Since mid last year, LNG producers have told us they collectively expect to export 88PJ of their 146PJ of uncontracted gas. This leaves 58PJ of uncontracted gas without the expectation of export, which, if it is produced and brought to market, would leave sufficient gas to address the risk of a shortfall. But it is not just for producers to prevent the shortfall. Governments also have a role in ensuring sufficient gas supply both immediately and over the longer term. LNG producers need to sell more gas domestically to ensure supply, ACCC boss says The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) commissioner, Anna Brakey, has given a speech about the domestic gas outlook for 2023 which I am going to include, in part, here. Brakey was talking about the issues with supply. The main takeaway is that the supply is there, but it is not being quarantined for the domestic market: Our last gas inquiry report, published in January 2023, found that the east coast gas market had sufficient supply if LNG producers were to contract an additional 30PJ of their uncontracted gas this year. However, if the Queensland LNG producers exported all of their uncontracted gas the domestic market would be 30PJ short. We were pleased that this figure was an improvement in the outlook since our report of July last year, which had predicted a shortfall of 56PJ if the LNG producers exported all their uncontracted gas. Yet at the time of our January report, the domestic market still required gas contracts for 2023 and beyond. There was also great uncertainty about the level of demand and production, representing a key risk that there would not be adequate supply of gas in 2023. The uncertainty around the level of demand in 2023 largely relates to the demand for gas-powered generation, which is critically dependent on the prevailing weather, and on the conditions in the electricity market, making it difficult to forecast. If the gas demand in the electricity sector increases above average or expected levels, the risks of a domestic gas shortfall across the board obviously increases. The variability in gas required for electricity is likely to increase as it takes on a greater role in firming generation during the transition to renewable energy. The variance and uncertainty of these predictions is evident when you look at AEMO’s [Australian Energy Market Operator] predictions from July last year. It highlighted that higher than-average demand for gas-powered generation could result in a domestic gas shortfall as high as 109PJ in 2023. This gas would likely be required from LNG producers. AEMO’s latest projections from March this year are slightly improved. They identified that there could be a supply shortfall of 33PJ in 2023, if the upper bound of expected gas-powered generation is required. This will still need LNG producers to sell more domestic gas. Party room Tuesday! Being a Tuesday, it is party room meeting day – so all the MPs are contained in their various party rooms discussing where they will take/vote upcoming legislation. We will bring you the outcomes of those meetings very soon. The parliament doesn’t start sitting until midday to allow for the meetings, so there is a few hours before things start getting down to business. ‘It’s just wrong’: Andrews on people protesting against trans rights The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says an anti-transgender rally held over the weekend was a “hateful event long before” neo-Nazis performed the salute at the demonstration. Liberal MP Moira Deeming has vowed to fight an attempt by the opposition leader, John Pesutto, to expel her from the parliamentary party room after she attended a rally on Saturday which she claimed was crashed by neo-Nazis. Deeming, who attended the rally in support of British anti-transgender activist Kellie-Jay Keen, said on Monday she had done nothing wrong. Andrews said the anti-transgender protest, held on the steps of state parliament, was not aligned with the views of mainstream Victorians: That rally was a nasty, hateful event, long before anyone did the Nazi salute. Why would you make it harder for trans Victorians? … It’s just wrong.” The Victorian opposition leader, John Pesutto, has accused Liberal MP Moira Deeming of “conducting activities in a manner likely to bring discredit on the parliament or the parliamentary party” in a letter warning her of his move to expel her from the party room. In the letter of motion, provided to Guardian Australia on Tuesday, Pesutto informed Deeming he would be calling a special meeting of the Victorian Liberal party room to hold a vote next Monday to expel her. He points to two key claims: (a) on 19 March 2023 and on days prior organising, promoting and attending a rally where Kellie-Jay Keen (also known as Posie Parker), was the principal speaker in circumstances where Ms Keen was known to be publicly associated with far right-wing extremist groups including neo-Nazi activists … (b) on 19 March 2023, meeting with and publishing a video with Kellie-Jay Keen, Katherine Deeves and Angie Jones, and that Angie Jones, on that day posted on Twitter words that, in the mind of any reasonable and lay observer, made association with Nazis including on 4.41pm by posting the words ‘Nazis and women want to get rid of paedo filth. Why don’t you.’ Attached to the letter, which is co-signed by deputy Liberal leader, David Southwick, and the leader and deputy leaders in the upper house, Georgie Crozier and Matthew Bach, is a dossier of “evidence” supporting the allegation. Pesutto writes that Deeming will be “given an opportunity to explain your conduct” before the vote. Deeming has vowed to fight the expulsion and says she’s done nothing wrong. She arrived at Tuesday’s party room meeting flanked by MPs Chris Crewther, David Hodgett, Ann-Marie Hermans, Bill Tilley and former opposition leader Matthew Guy. Deeming has been asked for comment. What is behind the latest fish kill event? This is absolutely heartbreaking for these communities, to see this happen once again. Graham Readfearn examines why fish are dying in their millions along the lower part of the Darling-Baaka River, and its impact on the people around Menindee: For tens of kilometres, millions of dead fish are floating in slicks along parts of the lower Darling-Baaka River, turning the water green and leaving a putrid smell around the small New South Wales town of Menindee. The scenes come just four years after the area witnessed a series of mass fish kills with millions of native fish perishing, prompting an independent inquiry. So what’s behind this current event? How and why did it happen, and could anything be done to stop it happening again? Other high-emitting countries need to ‘undertake more action’ – Simon Birmingham Liberal senator Simon Birmingham has responded to the IPCC report – he says it is important that all countries work to change the dial, and one country alone can’t do much to change the outcome. Australia is an advanced developed economy and so we have a leading role to play, setting an example and helping to drive technological changes in helping to ensure that we are providing the type of example to the rest of the world, but doing it realistically as well, understanding the limitations of what can be achieved, the implications for our economy and actually what other countries are doing. Of course, we have roles to play diplomatically too, but we also live in a highly contested world with enormous geopolitical challenges. And so, the reality, though, is that we need all countries, whatever their differences, to recognise the messages from the IPCC report and to be willing to engage and respond to them. But we should speak honestly in this country about the challenges in other high emitting, high growth countries and the need to get them to undertake more action, just as we have the debates about the domestic landscape and what we do here. Kevin Rudd is now Australia’s ambassador to the US, so he had to step back from his role at the Australians for a Murdoch Royal Commission – Malcolm Turnbull has taken his place. Greenpeace urges government to ‘follow the light’ of Pacific islands on climate action Greenpeace Australia has responded to the IPCC report – as you would expect they are urging in the strongest terms possible that the government respond. The group’s Pacific adviser, Shiva Gounden, said the Australian government could find inspiration in how the Pacific islands responded: 1.5C is still alive – but our last possible path to reach it is lit by those on the frontlines of the climate crisis. We must follow their light to survive. Pacific island nations suffer the worst impacts of the climate crisis, such as the recent devastation wreaked by twin Category 4 cyclones Judy and Kevin, but have historically contributed the least. This final report is resoundingly clear on the scale of the crisis facing the Pacific and the urgency needed, with low-lying coastal areas already reaching the limits of adaptation. The peoples of the Pacific continue to confront the devastating reality of the climate crisis with hope, determination and courage. But we do more than deal with the consequences. These proud people know that our lands and ways of living are worth saving – and have the conviction and plan to do so. Pacific island nations demonstrate global climate leadership from the frontline. The world must stand with them, starting with voting yes at the UN general assembly next week on Vanuatu’s landmark bid to prevent climate harm through the world’s highest court. Safeguard mechanism will ‘make biggest sizeable bite into carbon emissions’ in over a decade – Shorten So will the government adopt the recommendation from the UN to become net zero by 2040 or indeed 2035 – 10 to 15 years earlier than the 2050 goal? Bill Shorten says probably not: Well, we’ve got our policy settings. I’m not going to change them here. But what I do know is that if we can pass the safeguards mechanism legislation, we can make sure that industry has certainty to invest going forward. But we can make the biggest sizeable bite into our carbon emissions that the country has seen in over a decade. The Australian people don’t want us, you know, the Greens and Labor and the Liberals all finger pointing. They just want us to get on with business. They just want to get us on with the process of modifying our operations so that we can take real action on climate. I think this week could be very exciting and I think that the IPCC report just reminds us that we have an opportunity to not make the mistakes that happened in 2009 and not to squander the future. IPCC report shows ‘why we need to pass the important laws in parliament this week’ – Shorten Bill Shorten was on Sky News responding to the IPCC report: Well, the IPCC report is important, but I’m not sure it’s telling us anything that the government hasn’t already been thinking about for a while. I think there is a good challenge in it, though. It says that it is possible to keep global temperatures within an increase of 1.5C. And you know, this week what it shows is that the parliament of Australia, after 14 years of wasted opportunity, has got the chance to take out 205 cubic million tonnes of carbon emissions. So, the challenge is there, I think the IPCC is a reminder of why we need to pass the important laws we’ve got in parliament this week because together we can actually give a better, hand on a better future to our kids than the one we’ve currently got. The IPCC report makes for some very grim reading. These aren’t the conclusion of advocates, but scientists, who have determined we are on our last chance. ACT independent senator David Pocock told ABC RN Breakfast that there could not be “a more stark warning” and that we have a “moral duty” to act, particularly for Pacific nations and future generations. He also doesn’t think the Greens are being unreasonable when it comes to their “no new coal or gas” demand as part of the safeguard’s legislation. He says that yes, Australia needs climate policy, but it needs “climate policy that works”. When was the last time you were able to disconnect completely from work? As in, no emails, no phone calls, no last minute “can you check this” or calls to jump in an online meeting after hours? The Greens have introduced the “right to disconnect” bill which would amend the Fair Work Act to legislate the right for workers to not answer emails, calls or other messages after contracted hours unless they are paid to do so (availability allowance etc) or its an emergency. That’s after the senate work and care inquiry chaired by Greens senator Barbara Pocock recommended ways to modernise Australia’s working conditions. Adam Bandt, who introduced the private member’s bill, said workers had the right to switch off: Technology has seen work creep into personal time. If you’re not getting paid for it, you should be able to ignore the work texts and emails that arrive after hours. Switching off and disconnecting from work is vital for your health and work-life balance. Pocock, the Greens employment spokesperson, said Australian work conditions had not kept pace with the changing environment. Most of our working arrangements were put in place when households typically consisted of a male breadwinner with a female working to maintain a home and provide care for the family. Those arrangements are clearly out of date and we need to recognise that households are now run with at least two working adults who are increasingly sharing household and caring duties in addition to their working lives. … Availability creep, where workers feel they have to be available to answer emails all the time is harming their physical and mental health. Poor sleep, stress, burnout, degraded relationships and distracted carers are some of the consequences of workers feeling they should be available at all hours. Peter Dutton should ‘condemn’ Nazi protests – Peter Khalil Peter Khalil continued: We’ve also had a lot of commentary and different accounts of the event, I reckon with any political demonstration or protests, it’s important to go back to the first principles, why are you there? And if you’re there for a vision for a fairer and more just society, if you’re you’re an activist in that respect, great. But if you’re there for the opposite, there’s a big question mark, and if your attempt at civil dialogue is attracting neo-Nazis, to your protest, there certainly needs to be a reassessment of the approach. Now I know John Pesutto, the Victorian Liberal leader is taking a leadership position here and seeking to ban the MP that was involved in that rally. And that’s something that he’s doing. I would hope that the federal Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, also shows the same level of leadership and condemns that type of behaviour condemns the Nazis. Remember, you know, he’s a former defence minister, there were 40,000 Australians who died in world war two fighting fascism and fighting the Nazis. People died to actually give us the country that we’re living in today effectively, that generation which not many of them left, so I would hope that he comes down and condemns this unequivocally and supports his colleague in the Victorian Liberal party. Addressing far-right extremism starts with education, Labor MP Peter Khalil says The chair of parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, Labor MP Peter Khalil, also had a chat to Patricia Karvelas about the far right after what happened in Melbourne over the weekend: Often, the rise of the far right occurs when there … might be issues around inequality or socioeconomic issues. People are manipulated in the community. Let’s not forget what they are trying to do here. They are picking in this case, that was targeting the trans community. They pick out minorities to attack, they try and sow division and hatred and fear of the other. That is their ideological playbook. We should be aware of that and the way that they try and manipulate and get oxygen in their actions and trying to manipulate the community. We need to address that now. The security intelligence agencies play a role in that but more broadly, as a society, we have to address some of those underlying issues and it starts with education. Of course, it starts with people at a younger age, not being captured by or radicalised by these types of groups. There’s a lot of work being done by the federal government across not just a security intelligence agency, but I know across the entire government, because this is actually fundamental to our social cohesion. As a nation. We talk a lot Patricia about, you know, multiculturalism and the diversity of our nation as a strength and that’s all very, very true. But there are those who would seek to divide us based on our ethnicity, based on our identity, based on our sexual orientation. And that is the contest that is going on now and unfortunately, there has been a rise of these groups, particularly over the last 5 to 10 years. Lambie wants more action now to improve lives of First Nations people On the referendum machinery act, Jacqui Lambie says she hopes the bill can pass without too much more argument because she thinks there is already too much division out there. But she also thinks that there are things which can be done now to improve the lives of Indigenous people now. My point is right now you could be putting in things now that could be making a difference. That’s what you’ll hear in my speech. And there is no reason for you to wait and not to do what we’ve seen to be very successful in the past in these Indigenous communities that’s worked. And there was some really good opportunities that have been working over the years in those communities that could have been put back into place today. And that would show me that you’re actually serious about not just listening to the voice, of making the voice work, but you could show start showing that today. So that is what you’re going to hear in my speech today. … Just because we’ve had one government to another and said this is not working or whatever. The other my other problem is simply this – there is a lot of money there are billions and billions of dollars going out there to these Indigenous communities, there is too many shopfronts out there. I’ve seen this the whole time I’ve been running around over the last six or seven years of seeing the shopfronts, seriously, it’s not money that they need, you need to get this sorted out, because what you’re doing is you’re putting out money and it’s not presenting positive results. ‘It will be the Greens’ fault’ if safeguard mechanism falls over – Lambie The Tasmanian senator is also very sick of the fight over the safeguard mechanism. She thinks it is a start and it is a “perfect opportunity” for a start and if it falls over “it will be the Greens fault”. When it comes to the safeguards, I simply think there’s we need to starting point and the Greens I’m sick and tired of them getting your starting point – you have that big balance of power for the next two years. This is your starting point and you keep working on it, on decreasing those emissions, keep putting up bills, keep doing deals with the Labor government and keep reducing it that way. But if you don’t have a starting point here, we haven’t got the magic starter. We’re not going anywhere. We don’t even have a starting point and I think that’s really, really disappointing. My other issue obviously, is that we have manufacturing out there that just at this point in time cannot reduce its emissions by 4.9%. They cannot do that because the technology has not been invented. So we really need to make sure that if we want manufacturing to continue in this country we want to grow on that we have to accommodate for that. There’s no doubt about that. Look, they can continue their fight over coal and gas, but can the Greens please for goodness sakes, if you know if that’s what you’re standing on and you don’t get anything through it all then we’re back to where we started. We’ve got nothing, not even a starter point. We’ve got to have a starting point, we’ve got to look serious. I am worried that it’s gonna fall over it’ll be the Greens fault. You need to starting point this is your opportunity to get a starting point so we can keep working on reducing those emissions as we’re going along. That’s how it works up here. We just keep chipping away at them. But we need to start a point and I think this is a good start point. Jacqui Lambie says she thinks the government could deal with a “broken promise” on the stage-three tax cuts by playing the public straight. I think when people know that there’s people out there on enough money like me, and we’re getting a tax cut and don’t get one I don’t think the public’s really going to worry about it too much. That’s what I think. And I think they’ll be saying ‘good on you.’ It’s about time we started paying out and helping others less fortunate. Lambie on stage-three tax cuts: high income earners ‘shouldn’t be so greedy’ Also Jacqui Lambie doesn’t want the stage-three tax cuts – as a senator, her six figure wage would be one of those that benefits and she is saying “no thank you”. And she thinks most other people should say no thank you too, for the betterment of the country. People like me, people like me, do not need a tax cut, I can assure you, so please don’t give me one because I don’t want one and anybody else that’s in the situation that I am shouldn’t be so greedy. And now we’ve got to pass it on to those blokes [earning under $120,000] We’ve got to pay it forward. That’s what we need to be doing. And that’s that’s where Australia should be. And if it means that some of that money is redirected into those submarines or into anything else that we need for the future. I just think we need to cut those tax cuts right back. Jacqui Lambie expresses concerns over housing fund costing Over on ABC RN Breakfast, Jacqui Lambie is speaking about what it would take for her and Tammy Tyrrell to vote for the housing fund. Lambie says she supports the bill, but thinks it can be better – because she has concerns over whether houses would actually be built in how it stands now. We are worried about the $500m annual cap on disbursements to the fund because the way that we’re working out if you look at the next five years is that that that is only going to build it the amount of houses that you need to and I’m sorry, the house that you need to build is only is gonna end up about $80,000 per house. That’s the first problem that they have right now. We are worried also with the inflation on what that $500m looks like in the next nine or 10 years. That’s your other issue. So we are concerned about that. We’ve also asked for upgrades, upgrades and repairs in remote Indigenous communities … So we actually haven’t asked for a lot but we do want them to explain to us out of the money. How come we’re working it out that something’s going to end up about $80,000 a house and where’s the rest of money coming from, so that is a real worry for us. Nationals should follow security advice on social media – Littleproud And following Daniel Hurst’s update on Clare O’Neil accepting a report from security agencies on TikTok on government phones, David Littleproud has found a unity ticket. Yeah, I think obviously we’ve got to take the advice of our intelligence agencies. And that advice is becoming stronger and stronger. I think it’s unwise to have a TikTok account on your government held phone. We’ve got to understand the world we live in and the risk of having these phones as members of parliament, the privileged position we have, does pose to our national security. So I think it is important that the government takes that advice and if that’s the advice we should act swiftly on it. I would be very disappointed if any members of my National party didn’t adhere to any advice given by a security agency on social media, particularly TikTok. Littleproud says safeguard mechanism will force companies to buy offsets And here is David Littleproud on why they are voting no on the safeguard legislation: We need to find a pathway. There’s no linear pathway to net zero by 2050. The safeguards mechanism, this is about companies adopting technology to reduce their emissions. And so, the technology at the moment hasn’t been created. So what they’re saying, forcing companies to do, to go and buy offsets they’re going to pass on to you, the Australian consumer. Technology will solve this. We’re confident in that. The Nationals have been at the forefront of this, whether it be their biodiversity stewardship program, to … have sensible solutions that don’t mean we have to build 28,000km of new transmission lines. I think people on the land will participate. That’s what the National party want them to do, because they’re the stewards of the land. (The business community is actually in favour of the safeguards legislation, which was originally Coalition policy. Make of that what you will.) Littleproud says Labor’s housing fund ‘is costly and doesn’t go to heart of issue’ The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, was on ABC TV Breakfast explaining why the Coalition was voting no on so much legislation. On the housing fund: Well, just so Australians appreciate, this isn’t $10bn going to housing. This is the Australian taxpayer borrowing $10bn, paying an interest rate on that and hoping … they’ll reinvest back into social housing. I commend the government for trying to tackle this. Let’s look at this. This is a failure of state governments in particular. This is their bailiwick. The fact we tried to put in 3,000 homes when we’re in government, not commenting the government for trying, it’s just the mechanism they’re putting in place is costly and doesn’t go to the heart of the issue. And what it is also go is incentivise the states the walk away from their responsibilities they failed to undertake. And also with respect to planning. So also about supply. The state and local governments have the planning pen. Let’s have some commonsense solutions about lifting supply. In some cities it’s about going up, not necessarily out, if you want to live in the city that comes at the cost of density but you’re more than welcome to join us in the regions. Indigenous space academy, space salads and lunar rovers on show for Nasa The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) administrator, Bill Nelson, and the deputy administrator, Pamela Melroy, are in Adelaide today and Canberra later this week. The Australian Space Agency head, Enrico Palermo, said it was a “jam packed agenda … an important moment to show the nation the strength of the partnership between our two agencies”. He said the new academy will see five undergraduate or postgraduate students travel to Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. “We’re proud to have a brand and DNA that is built on the tens of thousands of years of First Nations astronomy and science,” Palermo said. The Nasa visit, the first from an administrator since 2014, included a visit to the international team creating space food and medicine at the University of Adelaide. The team has picked plants that can be grown on Mars to provide a complete, nutritional plant-based diet for astronauts. They have created a “space salad” of soya beans, poppy seeds, barley, ale, peanuts, sunflower seeds and sweet potatoes. The industry and science minister, Ed Husic, announced grants for two programs to design semi-autonomous rovers, using knowledge drawn from remote mining. The rovers will be part of Nasa’s Moon to Mars mission, and will be designed by two separate consortiums. “The rover will collect lunar soil known as regolith from the moon and deliver it o a Nasa payload, which will attempt to extract oxygen from the sample,” Husic said. Nelson said he was excited to work with Australia on the mission. “It’s cooperation like this that will enable Nasa and our international partners to uncover more discoveries. In this new era of space exploration, every advancement is not an achievement for one country – but for all of humanity,” he said. A very big thank you to Martin for starting us off this morning. We’ll switch to politics now with the safeguards mechanism, referendum machinery and housing future fund all taking centre stage from a legislation point of view, while Aukus continues to bubble away – and all of it under the shadow of the “final warning” from the IPCC report. Good times. You’ve got Amy Remeikis and the Canberra team with you. Ready? The federal government has confirmed it has received a review into the use of social media apps – including TikTok – on government devices. Last year the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, asked her department to review the cybersecurity implications of all forms of social media on government devices. This includes but is not limited to TikTok, whose parent company is the Chinese firm ByteDance. To date, some government departments or agencies have banned their employees from using TikTok on their work devices, but there is not a uniform policy – and the Coalition has recently stepped up its calls for clarity. Last night a spokesperson for O’Neil said in a brief statement: The government has received the review and is considering its recommendations. We are working to undo the years of inaction under the previous government, who failed to act or even provide advice about these issues as they developed. Labor MP ‘not convinced we can adequately deal with the non-proliferation risks’ of Aukus Daniel continues: Let’s bring you some more details about the Labor MP Josh Wilson’s concerns about Aukus. He also used his speech to parliament last night to raise fears about the precedent set by Australia relying on the US and the UK to acquire nuclear-powered submarines: I’m not yet convinced that we can adequately deal with the non-proliferation risks involved in what is a novel arrangement by which a non nuclear weapons state under the [non-proliferation treaty] comes to acquire weapons-grade material … There is no particular reason to expect the Aukus arrangement will be the only one of its kind. Wilson – while expressing his concerns about in the present tense – also took aim at the former defence minister Peter Dutton. Wilson had previously asked questions about some of these issues in a treaties committee hearing in 2021. Wilson said: For having the temerity to ask legitimate questions about those non-proliferation issues the now opposition leader referred to me in this place as ‘Comrade Wilson’. It’s an irony that the opposition leader, for all his self-styled tough guy patriotism, appears to not understand the fundamental difference between a liberal democracy and other systems in which asking perfectly reasonable questions is not only forbidden but has dire consequences. Wilson said the quality assurance mechanism in Australia’s system of government was contestability. He said it was important to always have a “rigorous and challenging conversation” about defence and security matters: The Aukus agreement, arrived at with some characteristically questionable secrecy by the former government and some strange ministerial arrangements, is not a sports team of which we have all suddenly become life members. It is a significant partnership with two of our most important and closest allies – but it will only be effective if we do our job as parliamentarians which is to look closely and to ask questions in order to guard against risk. I could be proved wrong about some of my concerns – perhaps they’re ill-founded in a way that I don’t perceive – and I can live with that. But I would be wrong already if I wasn’t prepared to identify and voice those concerns, which are based on work I’ve done consistently on some of these issues in this place since I was first elected. As promised, here’s our defence correspondent Daniel Hurst on those comments by Labor MP Josh Wilson. A federal Labor MP has broken ranks over Aukus, saying he is not convinced Australia should pursue nuclear-powered submarines. Wilson, the member for Fremantle, also said the cost and timeframes were likely to blow out. Wilson said he was “concerned about the question of nuclear waste” given that “we haven’t yet managed a storage solution for low-level waste after 40 years and more than $50m”. Wilson is the first member of the federal Labor caucus to go public with concerns since the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced the more detailed plans in San Diego last week. To date, the Labor caucus has been pretty disciplined, leaving it to some union leaders and former ministers – along with the former PM Paul Keating – to raise concerns. The Greens have strongly opposed Aukus. Wilson, while careful to avoid direct attacks on the government, told parliament last night it was “the plain hard reality” that “with an undertaking of this scale, complexity, cost and duration, there remain considerable risks and uncertainty”. He said Australia would be buying Virginia class submarines from the US in the 2030s “at a time when their own production schedule has been under pressure” before the Australian-built “SSN Aukus” submarines would be ready: But we know from both Collins and the French project, building submarines inevitably takes longer and costs more than anticipated. While I support the work of the government, I’m not completely convinced that nuclear-propelled submarines are the only or best answer to our strategic needs. Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be bringing you the main overnight breaking stories before Amy gets fired up shortly. Climate is one of the topics dominating the news this morning after scientists have delivered a “final warning” on the climate crisis, as rising greenhouse gas emissions push the world to the brink of irrevocable damage that only swift action can avert. At home, a poll conducted in four inner-city seats shows a majority of voters support a ban on new fossil fuel projects and don’t think big polluters should be able to use offsets for greenhouse emissions. Defence is another big focus with public support for the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine deal declining, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. Only a quarter think the subs are good value, while 40% of respondents said the submarine partnership would make Australia more secure, down four points since November. Only one in five voters said China was a “threat to be confronted”, which is interesting in light of Xi Jinping’s arrival in Moscow overnight where he pledged that Russia and China would “stand guard” to protect the world order. Speaking of submarines, federal Labor MP Josh Wilson has become the first to break ranks with the leadership by expressing doubts about the $368bn project. The member for Fremantle said he was not convinced Australia should pursue nuclear-powered submarines and also warned that the cost and timeframes were likely to blow out. We’ve got full details about what he said coming up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2019/jul/29/indias-strongman-pm-modi-to-appear-on-bear-grylls-man-vs-wild","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-29T14:58:24Z","webTitle":"India's strongman PM: Modi to appear on Bear Grylls' Man vs Wild","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jul/29/indias-strongman-pm-modi-to-appear-on-bear-grylls-man-vs-wild","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2019/jul/29/indias-strongman-pm-modi-to-appear-on-bear-grylls-man-vs-wild","fields":{"headline":"India's strongman PM: Modi to appear on Bear Grylls' Man vs Wild","bodyText":"India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, will appear with Bear Grylls in a wilderness survival television programme, the latest in a series of Putin-style media appearances in which the 68-year-old leader projects himself as a man of action and a champion of the environment. A trailer for the programme, Man vs Wild, which will air in India on 12 August, shows the two men cutting through forests, sniffing animal dung and floating down a river on a makeshift raft. In one scene, Modi holds an improvised spear and tells Grylls: “I’ll hold this for you.” The programme is the latest of Modi’s choreographed media appearances where the strongman leader casts himself as the a symbol of masculinity, strength and robust health – a pitch that appeals to his party’s nationalist voter base. “He is the alpha-male. He will not lose even a single opportunity to project himself as the man with the 56-inch chest,” said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of a biography on Modi, referring to a claim Modi made on his campaign trail in 2014. In recent months, Modi has bolstered that superhuman image – appearing in images that show him meditating in a Himalayan cave and doing early morning yoga exercises. “He wants to be seen as the biggest and most popular globally-accepted political leader from India ever. He wants to have iconic status globally.” Promoting the trailer for the programme, Modi tweeted: “India – where you find lush green forests, diverse wildlife, beautiful mountains and mighty rivers. Watching this programme will make you want to visit different parts of India and add to discourse of environmental conservation.” The programme previously caused controversy in India after the Indian Express reported that Modi was likely to have been filming with Bear Grylls on the day of a terror attack in the disputed region of Kashmir, when extremists from neighbouring Pakistan killed dozens of Indian armed security personnel and almost prompted military conflict. Some reports suggest Modi delayed taking action after the attack because he was in the wilderness filming with Grylls, but this has not been confirmed. “We know how important it was to him to feature in this show,” Mukhopadhyay said. The appearance with Bear Grylls will also bolster Modi’s image as a protector of India’s environment. Bhavreen Kandhari, an Extinction Rebellion activist in India, said Modi’s pro-business, pro-development government contributes to India’s environmental destruction. She ridiculed the UN’s decision to award Modi the title of Champion of the Earth in 2018. “I am standing in the most polluted city in the world,” she said, speaking over the phone from New Delhi. “My children’s lungs are black. There is no day when I don’t get calls about trees being cut down. There is absolute devastation.” Modi’s government has made international commitments to increasing India’s solar power production, but has also given the green light to controversial mining and infrastructure projects that will result in deforestation and environmental issues. In June, images from a giant landfill site went viral after it was reported that a mountain of garbage was set to climb higher than the Taj Mahal. On Monday, as he announced the results of a tiger census, which showed the number of Bengal tigers in the wild had risen, Modi said: “I feel it is possible to strike a healthy balance between development and environment. Our country is one where for thousands of years there have been teachings of co-existence [with nature].”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/jun/27/uks-biggest-carbon-capture-project-is-step-change-on-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-26T23:01:28Z","webTitle":"UK's biggest carbon capture project is step-change on emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/uks-biggest-carbon-capture-project-is-step-change-on-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/jun/27/uks-biggest-carbon-capture-project-is-step-change-on-emissions","fields":{"headline":"UK's biggest carbon capture project is step-change on emissions","bodyText":"The UK’s biggest carbon capture project will soon block thousands of tonnes of factory emissions from contributing to the climate crisis, by using them to help make the chemicals found in antacid, eyedrops and Pot Noodle. Within two years a chemical plant in Cheshire could keep 40,000 tonnes of carbon from the air every year, or the equivalent of removing 22,000 cars from the UK’s roads. The plant’s owners, a division of the Indian-owned Tata conglomerate, will then use the captured carbon to make the chemicals found in glass, baking soda or even medicine. The project is a step-change in the UK’s battle to cut carbon emissions from heavy industry and will capture more than 100 times the carbon dioxide trapped by an existing trial at the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire. The plans are backed by the government, which has agreed to give Tata Chemicals Europe a £4.2m grant towards the £16.7m cost of the project. Drax will receive a £5m government grant for a pilot, which could keep up to 16m tonnes of carbon from the air by the mid-2020s. In total the government plans to spend £26m to spur nine carbon capture projects which are “essential” if the UK hopes to reach its goal of cutting carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050. It is also spending £170m to create a net zero carbon “industrial cluster” in the UK by 2040. Carbon capture effectively traps the emissions from power plants or factory flues before they enter the atmosphere and contribute to global heating. The trapped carbon dioxide could be piped into permanent underground storage facilities, but it can also be purified to make products. Tata plans to refine the carbon emissions to make a high-grade liquid version of carbon dioxide which will help make sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda. The company is the only UK-based maker of baking soda which is in high demand by the pharmaceutical sector to help treat conditions from heartburn to kidney disease. It is also found in ear and eye drops. Tata is also the only company in the UK which produces soda ash, or sodium carbonate, which is used to make detergents, lemon sherbet power and glass. Martin Ashcroft, head of Tata Chemicals Europe, said the “hugely exciting” project would help to “reduce our carbon emissions, whilst securing supplies of a critical raw material”. Tata also owns one of India’s biggest energy companies and has promised to end investment in coal plants to focus of wind and solar power. Chris Skidmore, the minister for energy and clean growth, said: “Cutting edge technology to capture carbon will cut emissions as we work towards a net zero economy, while creating new jobs – a key part of our modern industrial strategy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2019/oct/18/haus-of-dizzy-its-a-way-to-wear-our-voices-on-the-body-part-that-listens","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-17T17:00:38Z","webTitle":"Haus of Dizzy: 'It's a way to wear our voices on the body part that listens'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/oct/18/haus-of-dizzy-its-a-way-to-wear-our-voices-on-the-body-part-that-listens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2019/oct/18/haus-of-dizzy-its-a-way-to-wear-our-voices-on-the-body-part-that-listens","fields":{"headline":"Haus of Dizzy: 'It's a way to wear our voices on the body part that listens'","bodyText":"There’s something called the Haus of Dizzy nod. When you’re wearing a piece by jewellery designer Kristy Dickinson, you get recognised by other members of her cabal. Actually, you get noticed by pretty much everybody. Enormous acrylic accessories promoting Aboriginality and inclusive values tend to make a statement – at the demonstration, at the club, on the red carpet, on the streets of Newtown or West End or Fitzroy. This is activism by cuteness. “My friends always say Haus of Dizzy is just Kristy spewed up in earring form,” Dickinson says. So, inside her head there’s room for treaty, trans pride flags, 90s hip-hop, dinosaurs, teen fashion dolls and smashing the patriarchy. Her slogan pieces rep environmental campaigns (“Stop Adani”), feminism (“The Future is Intersectional”), gay rights (“Love is Love”) and sweary mantras (“Fancy as Fuck”). Plus there’s her Indigenous Pride range with First Nations flag hearts, “Faboriginal” hoops and “Deadly” necklaces. “I just want to give pride to my people,” Dickinson says. “But in a cool, shiny way.” Top End Wedding actor Miranda Tapsell is a well-known fan. “Aboriginal culture isn’t considered trendy or cool in this country, so it’s great to subvert it to the truth,” Tapsell says. “Non-Indigenous people see me in my Haus of Dizzy earrings and they know where it’s at. Also, every Blak person stops you to say, ‘Is that Haus of Dizzy?’ It really gets us celebrating one another.” Haus of Dizzy pieces are designed to make the wearer feel something: pride, power, confidence. Or sexy and assertive, Dickinson says. “I get so many customers who say, ‘When I put these earrings on I feel so good and I make so many friends.’ I had one customer who bought some ‘Fuck Off’ bamboo hoops. Next week she came back and said, ‘Oh my God! I wore those earrings out, I felt so hot and I had free drinks all night. And two marriage proposals!’” Dickinson is a proud Wiradjuri woman. As a child, connecting to culture meant time with her nan and her glamorous, accessory-loving mum, or heading off to Dubbo for holidays with the extended family. “Going up to the country when I was little and talking to my aunties, sitting up at the kitchen table and hearing them all yarning around, that was my connection to my Aboriginality,” Dickinson says. But she also remembers getting teased for being Aboriginal, and crying when her mother tried to make her dress in black, yellow and red for a school flag costume day. It’s one of those childhood memories that still makes Dickinson cringe. “I just wish I could go back and shake that little girl and go, ‘Be proud of who you are and make your mum proud. Don’t ever be ashamed of who you are.’” Or maybe she should say: “Hey little Kristy – I make jewellery that remixes the best bits of our childhood, and adds in some stuff that was missing first time around.” Wentworth star Rarriwuy Hick is another devotee, and sees Dickinson’s work as empowerment: “Being an Indigenous woman and knowing what some of our daily obstacles can be, Kristy has used those struggles to empower us. But I don’t see her just doing this for Indigenous women. She’s doing it for the queer community, trans women, all women. It’s a way to wear our voices on the body part that listens.” Haus of Dizzy has a part-time assistant and an intern helping out now, but for most of the time since its 2015 launch the brand has been a solo operation. All pieces start with Dickinson’s designs. They’re laser cut using solar power then hand-painted and assembled in her Melbourne studio. In the early days, Dickinson mainly sold at markets – now it’s online and through stockists like GOMA, Melbourne Museum and (soon) The Iconic. You’ll still see her stall at Aboriginal events, though. And she makes time to run jewellery workshops at youth detention centres and domestic violence support centres. Dickinson talks a lot about instilling confidence in Indigenous children. As the daughter of a single mother, she says she never thought of owning a business. Dickinson financed it all herself – no loans, no grants – and hopes to be a role model for young people in her community. But if Dickinson is a symbol, then so is the stuff she makes. She tells the story of one tiny Haus of Dizzy fan who won’t go to school without her “Deadly” necklace on. So Dickinson and Hammonds are also working together on Dizzy Chicks, a brand new children’s range with stickers, clothing, merch and accessories. So far they’re working on six cute brown girl characters with individual personalities. A bit like an Indigenous Spice Girls. “It’s something I didn’t have when I was little,” Dickinson says. And then she laughs when asked how much Haus of Dizzy is really about feeding her inner child. “All of it!” she screams."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/live/2020/jun/17/hsbc-to-push-ahead-with-35000-job-cuts-covid-19-uk-inflation-eases-for-fourth-month-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-17T14:05:20Z","webTitle":"Global stocks extend rally as UK inflation eases - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jun/17/hsbc-to-push-ahead-with-35000-job-cuts-covid-19-uk-inflation-eases-for-fourth-month-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2020/jun/17/hsbc-to-push-ahead-with-35000-job-cuts-covid-19-uk-inflation-eases-for-fourth-month-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Global stocks extend rally as UK inflation eases - as it happened","bodyText":"Global stocks are extending their rally on hopes of a swift recovery from the Covid-19 crisis, but gains are limited by fears over a second wave, after an increase in infections in several US states and in Beijing. On Wall Street: S&amp;P 500 up 0.16% at 3,129 Dow Jones up 0.1% at 26,316 Nasdaq up 0.5% at 9,944 In Europe: UK’s FTSE 100 up 0.56% at 6,277 Germany’s Dax up 0.49% at 12,375 France’s CAC 40 up 0.89% at 4,996 Italy’s FTSE MiB down 0.01% at 19,623 Oil prices are heading lower, with Brent crude down 0.78% at $40.64 a barrel and US light crude falling 1.17% to $37.93. The Opec oil cartel forecast a gradual recovery in global demand for oil in its monthly report today. It estimates demand will drop by 6.4m barrels per day (bpd) in the second half of 2020, less than the 11.9m bpd decline in the first six months of the year when many economies around the world came to a virtual standstill because of Covid-19. UK inflation eased for a fourth month to 0.5% in May, a two-year low, as oil and petrol prices tumbled, along with toys and games, while food prices rose. The US released disappointing data on housing starts and building permits, suggesting the recovery in the housing market is slower than expected. HSBC has revived a plan put on hold three months ago to cut 35,000 jobs worldwide. One of Britain’s biggest mortgage lenders, Nationwide, is to triple the minimum deposit that first-time buyers must put down from Thursday (not immediately, as reported earlier).

Housebuilders will need government support such as a simplified planning system, similar to action taken after the financial crisis, argued Berkeley Group. With this, we are closing for today. We’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you for reading and stay safe! -JK The opening bell has rung on Wall Street, and stocks have opened cautiously higher. Dow Jones up 49 points, or 0.19%, at 26,339 S&amp;P 500 up 8.5 points, or 0.27%, at 3,133 Nasdaq up 45 points, or 0.46%, at 9,940 Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Capital Economics, tweets: The number of new US houses started in May rose 4.3% to 974,000, according to data from the US Commerce Department – less than the £1.1m expected. In April, housing starts fell 26.4% during the Covid-19 lockdown. The number of housing permits granted rose 14.4% to 1.2m in May vs a 21.4% drop in April. The figures suggest the housing market is recovering more slowly from the coronavirus crisis than expected. One of Britain’s biggest mortgage lenders, Nationwide, has tripled the minimum deposit that first-time buyers must put down as it braces itself for falling house prices and the possible return of ‘negative equity,’ writes Patrick Collinson. Nationwide said it will immediately withdraw all its new loan deals where the first-time buyer only puts up a 5% deposit, and set a new minimum deposit of 15%. The rise represents a dramatic increase in the amount that buyers will now have to save to buy the average home. According to Nationwide’s own house price index, the average UK house price is £218,902 – which means that a buyer will now have to stump up a minimum deposit of at least £32,835 compared to £10,945 before. Britain’s longest streak without generating coal-fired electricity came to an end last night after the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire fired up one of its coal power units, writes the Guardian’s energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose. The power plant’s post-maintenance test run scuppered a consecutive coal-free stretch of 67 days, 22 hours and 55 minutes, according to National Grid’s energy system operator division. Britain’s energy system last month recorded its first fortnight without generating electricity from coal since 1882, when one of the world’s first coal plants opened at Holborn in London. The record stretched to almost 68 days amid a boom in solar power due to the brighter than usual start to summer, and comes only two years after Britain’s first coal-free day since the Industrial Revolution. Following the brief spell of coal generation last night the British coal-free streak stood at just over 8 hours by late morning. At the same time Britain used gas-fired power for over two-thirds of the electricity generated domestically, in part due to lower than average wind power output which made up 1% of energy generation. Meanwhile, solar power made up 11% of the electricity generation mix, nuclear power contributed 15%, and biomass made up 8% of GB generation. In the latest coronavirus news, the Russian president Vladimir Putin has had three airport-style disinfectant tunnels built for him at his residence and at the Kremlin; and New Zealand cancelled exemptions from quarantine for compassionate reasons, after two women who had flown in from Britain to see a dying relative tested positive after they had been released on compassionate grounds. Authorities are now trying to trace 320 close contacts of the pair. More on our coronavirus live blog: More job losses: the banknote manufacturer De La Rue plans to raise £100m from investors and cut jobs at its site in north-east England as part of a turnaround plan focused on shifting to plastic notes. The company, hit by a string of recent setbacks including losing a contract to make Britain’s blue post-Brexit passports, said on Wednesday it would end banknote printing operations in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, putting 260 jobs at risk. Gateshead has also been hit by the loss of the passport contract. In the financial markets, stock markets are holding on to their gains, while oil prices are tumbling again. Brent crude is down 1.15% at $40.49 a barrel and US light crude has lost 2.1% to $37.57. US stock futures are pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later today, although traders are not expecting massive gains. They are torn between hopes of a quick economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis, boosted by yesterday’s surge in US retail sales and reports of a $1tn infrastructure spending plan, and fears of a second Covid-19 wave. Six US states including Arizona, Florida and Oklahoma saw sharp increases in new infections yesterday as lockdowns were eased. Beijing closed all schools, cancelled flights and extended movement curbs in the capital after the worst coronavirus resurgence since early February. As reported earlier, Berkeley Group, the housebuilder, said today that the housebuilding and construction industry will need government support, including a simplification of the planning process, if it is to play a leading role in helping the British economy recover from the coronavirus. Here is our full story. Britain’s financial watchdog has fined the London division of Germany’s Commerzbank £37.8m for failing to have proper controls to prevent money laundering between October 2012 and September 2017. The penalty would have been even higher – £54m – had the bank not agreed to resolve the matter at an early stage of the investigation. The Financial Conduct Authority said: Commerzbank London was aware of these weaknesses and failed to take reasonable and effective steps to fix them despite the FCA raising specific concerns about them in 2012, 2015 and 2017. The FCA executive director of enforcement and market oversight, Mark Steward, said: Commerzbank London’s failings over several years created a significant risk that financial and other crime might be undetected. Firms should recognise that AML [anti-money laundering] controls are vitally important to the integrity of the UK financial system. The watchdog found that the bank failed to: carry out timely regular due diligence checks on its clients. address long-standing weakness in its automated tool for monitoring money laundering risk on transactions for clients. For example, in 2015 Commerzbank London identified that 40 high-risk countries and 1,110 high-risk clients were missing from the tool have adequate policies and procedures in place when undertaking due diligence on clients. Germany’s flag carrier Lufthansa has warned that its €9bn bailout deal is in jeopardy. In an effort to garner support from investors, it said it might need to apply for protection from creditors if the state-backed rescue deal fails to win the backing of shareholders on 25 June. The airline issued the statement after the German billionaire Heinz Hermann Thiele – one of Germany’s richest men and Lufthansa’s biggest single shareholder – heavily criticised the rescue package, which will give the German government a 20% stake in Lufthansa and two seats on its supervisory board. In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Thiele said he had upped his stake to more than 15% and asked that alternative options be explored, suggesting that indirect state participation via the lender KfW could be an alternative to an outright government stake. He declined to say whether he would vote against the bailout package. Lufthansa’s executive board expects low attendance at its emergency meeting next Thursday, of below 50%, which would mean that two thirds of those present would need to vote in favour of the deal. The company said: In view of the latest public statements by the company’s largest single shareholder, Heinz Hermann Thiele, the board considers it possible that the stabilisation package could fail to achieve the two-thirds majority of votes cast that would be required in this case. This would mean that Deutsche Lufthansa AG would possibly have to apply for protective shield proceedings under insolvency law a few days after the annual general meeting if no other solution is found immediately. Lufthansa has also announced 22,000 job cuts as it battles for survival. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton, said: Following the benign inflation data from the UK, it was the same story in the eurozone but is not something to concern the European Central Bank. There had been signs of some inflation prior to the crisis, but they have disappeared. As with everywhere else, policy measures are potentially inflationary, but that’s a problem for the future, not now. The eurozone consumer price inflation rate for May was 0.1%, down from 0.3% in April, according to Eurostat’s final reading. Similar to the UK, the highest contribution to the inflation rate came from food and alcohol. In several countries, the annual rate is negative, for example -0.9% in Spain, indicating that prices are falling year-on-year. In Germany, the eurozone’s biggest economy, inflation is running at 0.5%. You can view the details here. Scotland’s economic output fell by a record 24% in March and April, the first weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, according to provisional GDP figures released by the Scottish government, reports our Scotland editor Severin Carrell. The interim data, which came with a warning they were subject to high levels of uncertainty, showed output dropped by 5% in March and then by 18.9% in April. This is the first time the Scottish government has produced monthly GDP estimates and suggests warnings that the lockdown has had a severe impact on the economy are correct. Its official data for the first quarter of 2020, covering the period before the lockdown fully took hold, said GDP fell by 2.5%. On Tuesday, UK data showed Scotland had the worst joblessness figures of any UK nation. The labour market survey put its unemployment rate at 4.6%, up 1.3 percentage points on a year ago compared to a 0.1 point rise for the UK as a whole, to 3.9%. Scotland’s employment rate was at 74.3% versus 76.4% for the UK. These data will strengthen demands from businesses to speed up the relaxation of Scotland’s strict lockdown regulations, adding to pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to respond. The country’s substantial tourism and hospitality industries are particularly vulnerable. Andrew Wilson, a lobbyist and pro-independence economist who advises Sturgeon, told BBC Radio Scotland that Scotland’s short term prospects were dire. He said: What’s clear to me is the UK is set to be the worst performing economy in the developed world and Scotland’s probably going to be a bit worse because of the nature of our sectors and how the virus has behaved north and south of the border.” Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish government’s economy secretary, said it was now essential Scotland’s devolved parliament had greater borrowing and financial powers to deal with the crisis, and appealed again for the UK government to extend the Brexit transition period. She said: The coronavirus pandemic is having an extremely serious impact on the economy right across the UK and - as these figures demonstrate - Scotland is no exception. Ever since the start of this crisis the Scottish government has been working tirelessly to keep businesses afloat and ensure as many people as possible keep their jobs, and we will continue to do that.” SSE shares are also trading 9% higher, at £13.84, after the energy giant announced it would spend more than £7bn over the next five years to help power the UK’s green economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, including a major onshore windfarm on Shetland. Here is our full story on Boohoo. Shares in the online fashion retailer jumped more than 9% to 425p this morning, after it reported a 45% surge in quarterly sales and snapped up the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse for £5.25m. Brexit negotiations between the UK and the European Union will enter a “hot phase” in September, according to a German government document, Reuters reports. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, suggested on Monday that an agreement could be reached in July with “a bit of oomph”. But the German government document, dated 15 June, appears to pour cold water on that idea. It says: From September the negotiations enter a hot phase. Britain is already escalating threats in Brussels, wants to settle as much as possible in the shortest possible time and hopes to achieve last-minute success in the negotiations. Europe’s main stock markets continue to push higher on economic recovery hopes. The mood in markets has also been lifted by clinical trial results yesterday that showed the steroid dexamethasone cut death rates by a third among severely ill Covid-19 patients in hospital. But fears of a second coronavirus wave persist, following an increase in Covid-19 cases in Beijing that has sparked a new travel ban in the Chinese capital, school closures and flight cancellations. Some US states have also seen higher infection rates. UK’s FTSE 100 up 0.75% at 6,289 Germany’s Dax up 0.9% at 12,429 France’s CAC 40 up 1.06% at 5,005 Italy’s FTSE MiB up 0.36% at 19,695 UK consumer price inflation fell to 0.5% in May, a four-year low, as oil prices tumbled. This has reinforced expectations that the Bank of England will respond with further economic stimulus tomorrow, by boosting its bond-buying quantitative easing programme by £100bn to £150bn. Crude oil prices have reversed earlier falls today. Brent crude is now trading almost 1% higher at $41.35 a barrel while US light crude is 0.86% ahead at $38.71. HSBC is pressing ahead with a massive redundancy programme that it put on hold three months ago because of the coronavirus pandemic. This will mean 35,000 job cuts across the bank’s 235,000 workforce. Chief executive Noel Quinn told staff in a memo, first reported by Reuters: “We could not pause the job losses indefinitely - it was always a question of ‘not if, but when’.” He said the measures first announced in February were “even more necessary today”. The continued easing in UK inflation reinforces expectations that the Bank of England will announce fresh economic stimulus at the end of its monthly meeting tomorrow at noon. The City is expecting that the central bank will boost its bond-buying quantitative easing scheme by at least £100bn, possibly £150bn. Here is our fully story: In case you are wondering what Domino’s new contact-free delivery box is -- my colleague Mark Sweney has put in a call to the company. It’s one big box to hold the whole order, rather than lots of smaller items. The Premier League resumes today after a 100-day absence because of the coronavirus pandemic, with Aston Villa v Sheffield United the first match to be played at 6pm BST. The NHS England director of mental health has warned betting companies not to exploit the return of televised football with “reckless” advertising campaigns that could cause more problem gambling while health service resources are stretched responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. The British bookmaker William Hill has raised £224m from institutional investors in a discounted stock sale, sending its shares down 4% to 133p. The company plans to use the funds to expand in the United States. The bookie is starting to reopen its betting shops gradually, as horse racing at Royal Ascot is underway (without spectators and with jockeys wearing face masks) and the Premier League restarts today, also behind closed doors. Virtual racegoers have been showing off their hats on social media as part of #StyledWithThanks, a charity appeal. The energy giant SSE is the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 this morning, with the shares jumping more than 9% to £13.85. It plans to spend more than £7bn over the next five years to help power the UK’s green economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, including a major new onshore wind farm on Shetland, writes our energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose. The company said it gave the greenlight to the £580m Viking onshore wind farm as part of its plan to spend almost £4m every day for the next five years to “spur a green economic recovery”. SSE will also move ahead as a minority partner in the £3bn Seagreen offshore wind farm spear-headed by French oil major Total, which will be the largest in Scotland. Together the projects will generate enough clean electricity to power around 1 million British homes. Alistair Phillips-Davies, SSE’s chief executive, said: “It’s easy to talk about a green recovery, but we’re putting our money where our mouth is with £7bn of low-carbon infrastructure projects that can deliver a win-win for climate and economy.” SSE also toughened its own climate targets by stretching a pledge to reduce the carbon intensity of the electricity it generates by 60% from 2018 levels by 2030, from 50% previously. Domino’s Pizza, Britain’s biggest pizza delivery company, has benefited from rising sales during the pandemic, but this boost has been wiped out by extra costs from implementing safety measures. It has had to re-route despatches to to stop two-person deliveries and invest in contact-free delivery boxes and face masks. Domino’s added: We have also seen a change in consumer purchasing behaviour and average basket composition, with a higher proportion of sides and desserts, which, whilst aiding our sales performance, has impacted our margins. As a result, the firm, a franchise of the US-based Domino’s Pizza, expects its core earnings in the first half to be slightly below last year’s. The company’s shares fell nearly 10% to 306p. New car sales in the EU suffered another sharp drop in May, with registrations down 52.3%, to 581,161 cars from 1.2m a year earlier. This was less steep than the 76.3% fall in April, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. This means car sales are down 41.5% in the first five months of this year. Double-digit declines were recorded in each of the 27 EU countries last month, although the percentage falls were less dramatic than in April. Spain posted the biggest fall among four major EU markets (-72.7%), while sales fell by roughly half in France (-50.3%), Italy (-49.6%) and Germany (-49.5%). European stock markets are rising again, as the rally of recent days continues. UK’s FTSE 100 index up 0.38% at 6,266 Germany’s Dax up 0.2% France’s CAC 40 up 0.2% Spain’s Ibex down 0.2% italy’s FTSE MiB up 0.4% Aside from the worrying spike in new Covid-19 cases in Beijing, which has prompted a new travel ban in the Chinese capital, school closures and flight cancellations, there has been some good news in the pandemic. Trial results for a steroid called dexamethasone released yesterday showed it reduced death rates by around a third among the most severe Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital. The steroid is normally used to reduce inflammation in diseases such as arthritis. UK health secretary Matt Hancock hailed the news this morning, speaking to Sky News. It does increase your chances of survival quite significantly. It is one of the best pieces of news we’ve had through this whole crisis. James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, expects headline UK inflation to stay below 1% this year, and “given the slack in the jobs market, we’d expect price pressures to stay fairly muted for some time”. He explains: The other argument that is often made in favour of inflation returning, is that governments and central banks are pumping vast amounts of cash into the system. But this is unlikely to lead to higher prices, at least in the short/medium-term. In the case of the government, its spending has so far been solely aimed at keeping firms and consumers afloat, rather than trying to stimulate demand (which by definition, is constrained by the ongoing lockdown measures). The bottom line is that inflationary pressures are likely to remain fairly muted for the time being. This, in turn, will keep the pressure on the Bank of England to maintain its current degree of stimulus, and we expect a further £150 billion of QE to be unveiled this week. Rising prices for food and non-alcoholic drinks partially offset the downward pressure from falling oil and petrol prices in May. However, the Office for National Statistics struggled to collect data because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some 74 items were unavailable to UK consumers in May, down from 90 in April. Back to the UK inflation numbers. Official figures showed the annual growth rate in consumer prices slowed to 0.5% in May as oil prices tumbled, the lowest annual rate since the Brexit vote in June 2016. ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said: The growth in consumer prices again slowed to the lowest annual rate in four years. The cost of games and toys fell back from last month’s rises, while there was a continued drop in prices at the pump in May, following the huge crude price falls seen in recent months. Outside these areas, we are seeing few significant changes to the prices in the shops. The housebuilder Berkeley Group, which focuses on London, Birmingham and the South East, has reported a 35% drop in pretax profits to £503.7m for the year to 30 April. The company called on the government to step in and support housebuilding, similar to the action taken after the global credit crunch of 2008/9. Rob Perrins, the chief executive, says: Housebuilding and construction can play a vital role in the broader economic recovery following Covid-19. This will require government support, similar to that seen following the 2008/09 financial crisis, including: the reversal of the property tax increases seen since 2014; a reduction in the bureaucracy and cost of planning; and direct investment into affordable housing. In other corporate news, the UK fashion retailer Boohoo has seen sales surge by 45% in the quarter to the end of May, as consumers turned to online shopping under the coronavirus, my colleague Mark Sweney writes. The online fashion specialist, which owns brands including Nasty Gal, Pretty Little Thing Coast and Karen Mullen, said that trading had initially been “mixed” as the UK went into lockdown. The company said that sales from the middle of March into early April fell year-on-year, as a result of the initial impact of the pandemic. However, throughout the rest of April and May its performance has been strong. Boohoo also said it was buying the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse for £5.25m. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Headline news this morning: HSBC will push ahead with 35,000 job cuts, Reuters reports, after getting hold of a memo. The bank is resuming a massive redundancy programme it had put on ice after the Covid-19 outbreak. The bank will also maintain a freeze on nearly all recruitment from outside, chief executive Noel Quinn said in the memo, which was sent to 235,000 staff worldwide. (Reuters said a spokeswoman confirmed the contents of the memo.) We could not pause the job losses indefinitely – it was always a question of ‘not if, but when’. UK consumer price inflation eased for the fourth month in a row in May and came in at an annual rate of 0.5%, as expected, according to the Office for National Statistics. That’s the lowest inflation rate since June 2016 and compares with April’s reading of 0.8%. Inflation has fallen as the coronavirus pandemic forced the government to impose a nationwide lockdown in late March and caused oil prices to tumble. Economists said this will no doubt add to the debate over whether the Bank of England might at some point be persuaded to take Bank rate below zero. Stock markets are expected to open flat after yesterday’s rally. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.56%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.2% while the Shanghai market has lost 0.18%. Beijing shut all schools again and cancelled flights after a spike in new Covid-19 cases, fuelling fears of a second wave. The UK’s FTSE 100 finished 2.9% higher at 6,242 points yesterday, and on Wall Street the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.89% while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 2.04%. Stocks were boosted by reports of a draft $1tn infrastructure spending plan from the Trump administration, targeted mainly at roads and bridges, and news of a 17.7% surge in US retail sales in May after the Covid-19 lockdown was eased. The stock market rally came despite another cautious message from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, who warned of a “long road” to recovery that will leave the US economy “well short of” where it was in February for some time. Stocks came off their highs when Powell, in his semi-annual testimony to the Senate, also said that the Fed’s corporate bond-buying programme could be tapered if the market function improves. On Monday, it was announced the Fed would start to buy individual corporate bonds. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, says: Recent data flow has offered hope of a more vigorous economic rebound than we initially thought possible. The Fed remains wary though, with a renewed wave of infections arguing for caution. As such, Powell again emphasised policy will remain ultra-loose with the potential that they could have to do more to ensure the recovery continues. He again tries to provide a reality check to the optimism in risk markets, such as equities, which are seemingly seeing only good things ahead. He warned of the risk of insolvencies, particularly in the small business sector and suggested that “until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely”. Given a vaccine appears some way off and fears over a pick-up in Covid-19 cases in several states, he is clearly sitting on the more cautious side of the fence.

Why not?","bodyText":"A new report from the US-based Energy and Policy Institute last week found that investor-owned utilities have known about climate change for nearly 50 years – and done everything in their power to stop governments from doing anything about it. From their commitment to toxic fuels to their corrosive influence on our democracy to their attempts to price-gouge ratepayers, it’s long past time to bring the reign of privately-owned electric utilities to an end. Recent findings about utilities mirror a 2015 investigation by Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times, in which reporters discovered that ExxonMobil – secretary of state Rex Tillerson’s former employer – had sponsored cutting-edge climate research as far back as the 1970s. Like Exxon, utility industry groups hired scientists to investigate the impact of carbon dioxide on the environment. Also like Exxon, they then proceeded to funnel millions into lobbying efforts and misinformation campaigns that cast doubt on those same scientists’ research. A 1988 report from the Edison Electric Institute and the industry-backed Electric Power Research Institute advised that “climate changes possible over the next 30 years may significantly affect the electric utility industry”. A year later, the country’s investor-owned utilities had become enthusiastic members of the Global Climate Coalition, an international lobbying outfit whose crowning achievement was convincing George W Bush to withdraw from the Kyoto protocol. Climate forecasts are more dire now than they were when utilities and oil companies started looking into them, and a key piece of avoiding the most severe impacts of warming is to rapidly change how we turn on our lights. Electric power currently accounts for about 35% of all of the United States’ energy-related carbon emissions. Nearly 70% of that stems from the coal-fired power plants utilities have spent millions trying to keep running. Scientists say we have a rapidly closing window of time to decarbonize the whole of our economy, a large part of which involves making huge swaths of it run off of electricity. The utilities needed to make that change happen, meanwhile, seem dead-set on doing exactly the opposite. The industry has set its sights in particular on rooftop solar. In backing campaigns to end net-metering – a policy that lets people with solar panels sell excess power back to utilities at market rates – investor-owned utilities are deliberately stymying changes that could be as good for ratepayers as they are for the environment. On this and their other political priorities, electric utilities spent more than $114.3m on lobbying in 2016. Already in 2017 that figure is up to $59.9m. What’s clear now is that the electric utility sector is broken, and its biggest and most influential firms can’t be trusted to work in the public’s best interest. Massive transformations in the electric power sector are both desperately needed and eminently possible. Updating our outmoded grid system, for instance – making it easier for customers to sell back power to their power providers – could yield fairer rates for customers and hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs. The only way to get there is to take investors’ endless thirst for short-term profits out of the equation. Of course, America’s many publicly owned utilities are in need of massive reforms, too. The sector as a whole is beholden to a series of archaic regulations written before solar and wind generation was possible. But the kind of wholesale transformation science demands of it will be virtually impossible so long as a small handful of wealthy elites are calling the shots. Dethroning the utility barons isn’t such a crazy idea. The Labour manifesto Jeremy Corbyn ran on in the last UK general election called for a “transition to a publicly owned, decentralised energy system”. In the US, we have our own examples for how to put electric utilities back under democratic control. Some of them, like our New Deal-era rural electric cooperatives, already are. And towns and cities here and around the world are moving to make power provision more low-carbon and democratic. There’s no need to stop at electric utilities, either. Since the financial crisis, people on both sides of the Atlantic feel out of control of their economic lives, saddled with both mounting debts and stagnant wages. All the while, the rich are getting richer. That so many aspects of our economy are controlled by so few people represents as much of a crisis for the planet as it does for democracy. Putting it back into public hands is an opportunity to start mending both."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/dec/05/brazil-ngos-crackdown-raids-amazon-fires","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-05T18:19:19Z","webTitle":"'Someone has declared war': Brazil activists fear crackdown after arrests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/05/brazil-ngos-crackdown-raids-amazon-fires","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/dec/05/brazil-ngos-crackdown-raids-amazon-fires","fields":{"headline":"'Someone has declared war': Brazil activists fear crackdown after arrests","bodyText":"For Brazil’s embattled civil society activists, the government’s distortion of truth has taken many forms since the ultra-right militarist Jair Bolsonaro took power at the beginning of this year. But it has hit a menacing new level after last week’s police raid on an Amazonian NGO and the arrest of four volunteer firefighters who are accused of setting alight the forest they risked their lives to protect. Even by the standards of the past 11 months, the detentions in Alter do Chão, and the confiscation of equipment at the headquarters of Saúde e Alegria, or the Health and Happiness Project, in Santarém have proved shocking for those involved – and those who fear they may be next. Until recently, Brazilian NGOs’ greatest fear was being publicly smeared by a president who has baselessly accused Greenpeace of creating oil slicks, environmentalists of starting forest fires and Leonardo DiCaprio of bankrolling the arson. Now activists worry the powers of the state are being used to criminalise their activities. “The executive has been investing in new tactics of repression,” Camila Marques from the free-speech watchdog Article 19 said during a webinar of NGOs this week. “We have never seen intelligence agencies, police and services so active in monitoring and surveillance of social movements. We are facing a scenario of arbitrary imprisonments.” The case in Santarém is seen as a bellwether. Shortly after dawn last Wednesday, half a dozen federal police armed with semi-automatic weapons showed a warrant and demanded entry to the premises of Health and Happiness Project – a long-established NGO that has worked with Prince Charles, Caritas, Coca-Cola and many other international partners. Staff turned up for work expecting to organise medical assistance, sanitation or solar power for remote forest communities – but instead found state agents examining documents and hauling off computers and files. “I was afraid at first, then angry,” said Jarine Reis, who is responsible for projects related to gender, tourism and traditional art. “I could taste the wrongness in my mouth.” Members of the group felt the raid was politically motivated – and part of a broader assault on civil society by the government of Bolsonaro. “It’s completely unacceptable in a democracy. This show of force is disproportionate. We feel violated and disrespected,” said Paulo Lima, a senior coordinator. “Unfortunately, though, at this moment in Brazil, political polarization is leading to a criminalisation of civil society.” The mood of disbelief and fear grew stronger as news came in that one of Health and Happiness’s chief logistical officers, Gustavo Fernandes, had been arrested, along with three other men. The four had set up their own volunteer fire brigade to help the authorities tackle forest blazes in Alter de Chão, one of Brazil’s beloved resort towns and a mecca for artists and nature lovers. The riverside community is also a heartland of the environmental movement in Brazil. The four men were initially denied bail and their heads were shaved. Families and friends believe they were targeted to reinforce Bolsonaro’s claim in August that environmental activists were responsible for the worst Amazonian fires in a decade – rather than his own government, which has weakened forest protections and encouraged loggers, miners and land grabbers. Bolsonaro and the environment minister, Eduardo Salles, praised the detentions. Civil police said the suspects were under investigation for arson. Local media alleged – without proof – that they started a huge fire in September so they could take photographs for fundraising from the WWF and others. But the fragility of the case was quickly apparent. Federal prosecutors challenged the validity of the investigation, saying they looked into the allegations in September and found nothing to suggest any causal link between the fires and the volunteer brigade. In a public statement, they said the evidence pointed instead to land grabbers and property speculators, who use fire to clear forest and drive up its commercial value. The case was further weakened when the suspects provided alibis that showed they were far from the fires when they started – in one case, on a plane. As doubt grew, the governor of Pará replaced the chief investigator and a judge ruled the men should be released until their court hearing. Friends of the arrested men say all four left jobs in São Paulo so they could live closer to nature in Alter do Chão and work with tourism, permaculture and forest protection. They said the founder, Daniel Gutierrez – a 36-year-old photographer and tourist operator – worked with the authorities, received training from the state fire brigade, and went out of his way to be politically neutral. “Everybody is in shock. Nobody can believe it,” said Priscila Cotta, who has known the men for several years. “Why would those who fight fires start fires? Everyone knows they devote themselves to the forest.” Others, who are reluctant to give their names due to fears of retribution, believe the raid and arrests may be linked to land speculation. Gutierrez was planning to start an organisation that would create a deforestation firewall that would prevent a sprawl of tourist resorts along the bank of the Tapajós River. Members of Health and Happiness – which has no formal links with the volunteer brigade – have not been charged with any crime, but the police confiscation of computers and files has paralysed the group’s operations, including a hospital boat that was due to carry 40 doctors and nurses and 14 tonnes of medicine and equipment to a remote community on the Arapiuns River. Other NGOs warn this could be just the start of a crackdown. With the government planning to tighten restrictions on public protests and relax regulations on the police, the space for civil society looks set to shrink. The Brazilian Association of Non-Governmental Organizations said the government was pursuing a strategy to delegitimize civil society. Amnesty International’s executive director in Brazil, Jurema Werneck, said Bolsonaro’s tactics echoed similar moves in Russia, India and Hungary. “The rhetoric of the president and other government officials creates an environment of extreme vulnerability for NGOs, activists and human rights defenders,” she said. Those already in the midst of this assault say they have been living a nightmare. “Each day seems 100 hours long, we never have time for anything, and we feel that someone has declared war on us,” said Caetano Scannavino, a co-founder of the Health and Happiness Project. But he retained faith in Brazil’s institutions to right a wrong, and expressed gratitude for the many people who have given support. “We have received huge solidarity from all sides. They can take our documents, but they cannot take our joy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/26/solar-power-breaks-uk-records-thanks-sunny-weather","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T15:09:00Z","webTitle":"Solar power breaks UK records thanks to sunny weather","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/26/solar-power-breaks-uk-records-thanks-sunny-weather","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/26/solar-power-breaks-uk-records-thanks-sunny-weather","fields":{"headline":"Solar power breaks UK records thanks to sunny weather","bodyText":"Solar power has broken new records in the UK by providing nearly a quarter of the country’s electricity needs, thanks to sunny skies and relatively low summer demand. National Grid said the thousands of photovoltaic panels on rooftops and in fields across the UK were generating 8.7GW, or 24.3% of demand at 1pm on Friday, smashing the previous high of 8.48GW earlier this month. Experts said the unprecedented share for solar energy meant about 60% of the UK’s power was low carbon, taking into account Britain’s wind farms and nuclear power stations too. That figure is normally around 50%. National Grid, which is tasked with ensuring a match between supply and demand for electricity, said it was excited but unfazed by the challenge of accommodating “significant volumes” of renewables. Duncan Burt, who manages day-to-day operation of the grid, said: “We have planned for these changes to the energy landscape and have the tools available to ensure we can balance supply and demand.” Hannah Martin, head of energy at Greenpeace, said: “Today’s new record is a reminder of what the UK could achieve if our government reversed its cuts to support for solar, and backed the clean technologies that could provide jobs, business opportunities and plentiful clean energy for decades to come.” The milestone reached on Friday is the latest in a series of records for solar, which has grown from almost nothing seven years ago to 12GW of capacity today. Last summer it provided more power than the UK’s last 10 coal-fired power stations. In April this year, Britain achieved its first-ever full working day without coal power since it started burning the fuel in 1882, thanks in part to solar energy. Solar’s rapid growth is overturning conventions for the managers of the UK’s power grid. In March, for the first time ever, the amount of electricity demanded by homes and businesses in the afternoon was lower than it was in the night, thanks to the cut in demand due to solar panels. Alastair Buckley, a solar expert at the University of Sheffield, said of the latest record: “I think it’s a positive sign. It’s free electricity today, for the consumer, and we should make the most of it.” He said that with solar continuing to be installed despite the government’s drastic subsidy cuts in 2016, further records will certainly be broken this summer and for years to come. Buckley said the grid could handle a far greater proportion of solar power than currently seen, because gas power stations could be ramped down. For National Grid, periods of high pressure bringing lovely weather to the UK like this week were: “really predictable, so easy to plan for,” Buckley said. Robert Gross of Imperial College said: “This doesn’t pose fundamental problem for the grid – many sunnier countries manage a similar proportion of solar on a much more regular basis.” Government statistics published on Thursday show that UK solar power capacity has grown from 11.3GW in April last year to 12.1GW this year, enough to power 3.8m homes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2019/nov/29/i-made-excuses-music-industry-frets-over-becoming-carbon-neutral","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-29T12:41:22Z","webTitle":"'I made excuses': music industry frets over becoming carbon neutral","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/29/i-made-excuses-music-industry-frets-over-becoming-carbon-neutral","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2019/nov/29/i-made-excuses-music-industry-frets-over-becoming-carbon-neutral","fields":{"headline":"'I made excuses': music industry frets over becoming carbon neutral","bodyText":"As they released their eighth album, Everyday Life, Coldplay announced last week that they would not be taking it on tour, instead performing the album just once on British soil at the Natural History Museum. Frontman Chris Martin expressed his concerns about the future of touring, highlighting the difficulties of reconciling flying with environmentalism and expressed a wish to see a Coldplay show run largely on solar power with no single-use plastic. Snark was instant – “Coldplay announces plan to spare planet the effects of future Coldplay concerts” ran one headline – but others lauded the move: the band’s previous tour featured 122 shows across five continents and generated £405m. Massive Attack also declared this week that “business as usual is over’’ as they begin working with the University of Manchester’s Tyndall Centre to map the carbon footprint of tours and work on a blueprint to reform the industry, a message similarly shared by Billy Bragg on his recent tour. Bragg tells me: “I looked at what I do and thought, how can I do this in a way that is more conducive to a greener way of touring?” As well as raising the issue at his shows he now limits his flights through a new touring model: Bragg is the only member of his crew to fly to the US, where he then drives from venue to venue with a small team, settling in each city for a number of shows. Chiara Badiali, from UK based music and sustainability charity Julie’s Bicycle, says “reimagining touring is probably the music industry’s biggest challenge – it will have to change”, while Lewis Jamieson, a founder member of UK climate action group Music Declares Emergency, backed Coldplay’s action. “If they can create a template for touring that is more sustainable,” says Jamieson, “they are in a position where they can drive that research more than smaller acts – something that will benefit all artists.” But gigging is more important than ever to artists in the age of streaming and rapidly declining CD sales – and especially for those who are not industry juggernauts. It was reported last week that the value of the British live music industry reached a record high of £1.1bn in 2018. Is radical change possible? Writing in the Guardian, Massive Attack’s Robert Del Naja admitted that bands won’t completely stop touring. Fay Milton, co-founder of Music Declares Emergency and member of British post-punk group Savages, agrees: “Music, playing music and sharing culture is a beautiful and amazing thing and we shouldn’t stop that altogether.” This was reiterated by Jamieson, who declared the end of live music “neither feasible nor desirable”. Bragg says: “There’s something that you can get at a gig that you can’t get online. It’s a form of communion. That feeling of not being alone, there’s not many places you can get that any more.” Milton acknowledges she contrived explanations while touring. “I was really aware that we were heading towards climate catastrophe but I made excuses because it was art and I saw it as different,” she says. “But no one really gets special dispensation. This is something we all need to do.” Milton says she doesn’t know if she’ll enjoy touring any more, without feeling the weight of it. Coldplay and Massive Attack are not the only acts to address these matters. In 2010, Drake billed his Away from Home tour as half tour, half environmental campaign, working with not-for-profit organisation Reverb to minimise the tour’s environmental impact. Reverb has since grown, working with Pink, Fleetwood Mac, Harry Styles and Maroon 5 in the last year alone, and Billie Eilish’s tour in 2020 will also be in partnership with the company. Eilish expressed her support for climate activism in a video entitled Our House Is on Fire and earlier this week wore a “No Music on a Dead Planet” T-shirt at the American Music awards – the same slogan touted by Foals at this year’s Mercury prize ceremony. Much of the efforts of Reverb and its affliated artists’ focus on actions such as limiting the use of plastic straws, providing water for reusable bottles and educational hubs around the venue – actions that align closely with Music Declares Emergency’s plan. However, far more work is needed to tackle the larger contributing factors relating to climate change and the entertainment industry. The Green Touring Network report that 34% of a tour’s carbon footprint comes from the venue itself, followed closely by audience travel (33%), with the third biggest factor being merchandise at 12%. The 1975 have addressed the merch question in an easy but somewhat radical step: “upcycling” unsold previous merchandise by applying new graphics. As well as focusing on recycling and waste reduction backstage, Mumford and Sons reported – somewhat vaguely – that they worked to reduce the carbon footprint of their recent tour. KT Tunstall took the more direct approach of planting thousands of trees, a move similarly adopted by Coldplay in 2002. But carbon offsetting was criticised by Del Naja, who said it “creates an illusion that high-carbon activities enjoyed by wealthier individuals can continue, by transferring the burden of action and sacrifice to others”. Tours will need to not generate CO2 in the first place, and there will need to be pressure from artists and promoters on venues to switch to sustainable energy sources – or face losing their business. There are more radical solutions besides, particularly regarding audience travel. Milton argues that live music “doesn’t have to be commercial or something you do on stage, it can be a lot more participatory as well. There’s a lot of interesting technology there.” MelodyVR allows fans not attending a gig to watch it via a virtual reality headset and app. “Instead of a 50-day tour, some artists prefer to do five and share it via VR,” says Anthony Matchett, MelodyVR’s CEO and founder. Another potential solution could be livestreaming performances to cinemas, as Kanye West did for the recent launch of his album Jesus Is King. Bragg resists ideas like this though, complaining that “so many people experience culture through a screen in isolation”. The passion for live music is unlikely to abate, then, for artists or audiences. The key challenge, as Jamieson says, is “to find ways of doing things better first, rather than assuming that the only way is to stop doing them”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/12/disappearing-glaciers-orangutans-and-solar-power-green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-12T15:26:08Z","webTitle":"Disappearing glaciers, orangutans and solar power – green news roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/12/disappearing-glaciers-orangutans-and-solar-power-green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/12/disappearing-glaciers-orangutans-and-solar-power-green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Disappearing glaciers, orangutans and solar power – green news roundup","bodyText":"Environment news US Glacier national park losing its glaciers with just 26 of 150 left Indian solar power prices hit record low, undercutting fossil fuels US signs treaty to protect Arctic, giving some hope for Paris agreement British embarrassment over asking for tap water in bars fuels plastic bottle waste – survey Water companies losing vast amounts through leakage, as drought fears rise Conservationists plan expedition to secret ‘Noah’s Ark’ in Sumatra Nine dead in Amazon’s worst land-related killings in decades Republicans fail to repeal methane regulations for drilling on public lands Full tilt: giant offshore wind farm opens in North Sea Worried world urges Trump not to pull out of Paris climate agreement In depth ‘Turn it off’: how technology is killing the joy of national parks The great climate silence: we are on the edge of the abyss but we ignore it | Clive Hamilton How 80 forgotten 1930s cycleways could transform UK cycling 10 selfish reasons to save elephants Multimedia The week in wildlife – in pictures Narwhals: new footage reveals possible purpose for mysterious tusk – video Life as a whale: a humpback’s view of the Antarctic – in pictures The Bornean orangutan’s world – in pictures Observer Food Monthly Awards: vote for the best ethical food project Do you know a food initiative that’s making a difference?

By mid-century greenhouse gas emissions would be slashed by 90% from 1990 levels under Spain’s draft climate change and energy transition law. To do this, the country’s social democratic government is committing to installing at least 3,000MW of wind and solar power capacity every year in the next 10 years ahead. New licences for fossil fuel drills, hydrocarbon exploitation and fracking wells, will be banned, and a fifth of the state budget will be reserved for measures that can mitigate climate change. This money will ratchet upwards from 2025. Christiana Figueres, a former executive secretary of the UN’s framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), hailed the draft Spanish law as “an excellent example of the Paris agreement”. She added: “It sets a long-term goal, provides incentives on scaling up emissions technologies and cares about a good transition for the workforce.” Under the plan, “just transition” contracts will be drawn up, similar to the £220m package announced in October, that will shut most Spanish coalmines in return for a suite of early retirement schemes, re-skilling in clean energy jobs, and environmental restoration. These deals will be partly financed by auction returns from the sale of emissions rights. The government has already scrapped a controversial “sun tax” that halted Spain’s booming renewables sector earlier this decade, and the new law will also mandate a 35% electricity share for green energy by 2030. James Watson, chief executive of the SolarPower Europe trade association, said the law was “a wake-up call to the rest of the world”. Energy efficiency will also be improved by 35% within 11 years, and government and public sector authorities will be able to lease only buildings that have almost zero energy consumption. Laurence Tubiana, chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, and former French climate envoy who helped draft the Paris accord, described the agreement as groundbreaking and inspirational. “By planning on going carbon neutral, Spain shows that the battle against climate change is deadly serious, that they are ready to step up and plan to reap the rewards of decarbonisation,” she said. However, the government’s hold on power is fragile. With just a quarter of parliamentary seats it will depend on the more leftwing Podemos and liberal Ciudadanos parties to pass the climate plan. No dates were included in the legislation for phaseouts of coal or nuclear energy, and a ban on new cars with petrol or diesel engines was delayed until 2040."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/nov/06/ross-garnaut-three-policies-will-set-australia-on-a-path-to-100-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-05T17:00:09Z","webTitle":"Ross Garnaut: three policies will set Australia on a path to 100% renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/06/ross-garnaut-three-policies-will-set-australia-on-a-path-to-100-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/nov/06/ross-garnaut-three-policies-will-set-australia-on-a-path-to-100-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Ross Garnaut: three policies will set Australia on a path to 100% renewable energy","bodyText":"Australia could set a path to 100% renewable electricity, a highly reliable grid and significantly cheaper wholesale prices than today by introducing a handful of policies consistent with the Morrison government’s election platform, the economist Ross Garnaut says. Writing in his new book, Superpower, which builds on his advice to Labor governments in 2008 and 2011 to set out a vision for a low-carbon future, Garnaut says introducing three policies that align with the government’s commitments could “increase the chances of a strong outcome”. He says embracing low-carbon opportunities could lead to a clean electricity system more than three times the existing capacity that powers a transformed economy, including electric transport and new and expanded industries in minerals smelting. “I have no doubt that intermittent renewables could meet 100% of Australia’s electricity requirements by the 2030s, with high degrees of security and reliability, and at wholesale prices much lower than experienced in Australia over the past half dozen years,” Garnaut writes. “More importantly, I now have no doubt that, with well-designed policy support, firm power in globally transformative quantities could be supplied to one or more industrial locations whenever it is required in each state, at globally competitive prices.” Garnaut’s recommendations include: Rewarding private investors who pay for new long-distance, high-voltage transmission lines, boosting the reliability and security. Fully adopting a consumer watchdog recommendation that it use the green bank, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, to underwrite smaller electricity generators to provide “firm” power supply contracts at low price. The government has embraced this in part, but the project shortlist focuses on “peaking” power rather than overall supply, and the process of choosing and underwriting the developments has been opaque. Breaking Snowy Hydro in two, so the existing generator and retailer is separate to a new body responsible for reliability. The new corporation – which Garnaut calls the Snowy Hydro Guarantee, or Sneg – would be required to ensure constant capacity to balance supply and demand across the grid. It would use the cheapest firm generation, whether from the planned “Snowy 2.0” expansion or other pumped hydro developments, batteries or demand management. Prices would have to remain below a maximum level set by the Coag energy council. Now a professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne and the chair of the advisory board to the Australian-German Energy Transition Hub, Garnaut set out the three steps in lectures before the election, conscious they were consistent with the policies of both major parties. He said an emissions trading scheme, as he previously recommended and what the mislabelled “carbon tax” would have become had it not been repealed, remained an economically and environmentally superior option but he recognised it was not feasible now or in the foreseeable future. “There’s no need to do any more than those things in the electricity sector this electoral term,” he said. “Once everyone sees that we’re on a path to more secure, reliable, lower cost power that is giving a new future to Australian industry it will introduce some momentum.” Superpower builds on the knowledge, yet to take hold in some political and media discussions, that Australia implicitly signed up to a goal of net zero global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 when it joined the 2015 Paris agreement. More than 60 countries have set targets of net zero emissions by 2050. Australia has a 2030 target of a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels but, like China and the US, has not set a longer-term target. Australia’s emissions have increased each year since 2015. Angus Taylor, the emissions reduction minister, has appointed a panel headed by Grant King, the outgoing president of the Business Council of Australia, to make quick suggestions on ways to improve the emissions reduction fund, the government’s main climate policy. Garnaut found that, even more than when his first review was published in 2008, Australia had more to lose from escalating emissions than other wealthy nations and more to gain from acting. If Australia rose to the climate challenge it would emerge as a “global superpower in energy, low carbon industry and absorption of carbon in the landscape”. He said the cost of cutting emissions had fallen “far below” what modelling suggested 11 years ago. “No other developed country has a comparable opportunity for large-scale, firm, zero-emissions power, supplied at low cost,” he said. In 2008, he found the world moving to tackle rising emissions would hurt the competitiveness of Australian industries in the short term. But the dramatic decline in the cost of renewable energy had brought forward by a decade the time when cheap wind and solar power could provide the country with an advantage in energy-intensive manufacturing. Along with the expected development of green hydrogen, it could help make Australia a natural home for expanded industries in aluminium, steel, silicon and ammonia. He said this would benefit regional centres in every state, including the Pilbara in Western Australia, the Upper Spencer Gulf in South Australia, Portland and the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, Newcastle in NSW, Townsville, Gladstone and Mackay in Queensland and parts of Tasmania. Garnaut found Australia has also barely begun to explore the extent to which it could build an industry out of capturing carbon in soils, woodlands and forests. Superpower suggests up to 1bn tonnes a year could be captured, nearly twice Australia’s annual emissions. “It is of national economic consequence that we undertake the research to define the scale of and the means of unlocking the opportunity,” he said. He said tapping that value would require creating a market. Initially, that could involve offsetting fugitive emissions, particularly from new liquefied natural gas production, which are the main reason national pollution has increased. In the longer term, credits would need to be sold on the European market (where the carbon price is currently equivalent to about A$40) and other international markets as they emerged."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/jan/17/nuclear-power-can-be-green-but-at-a-price-hitachi-toshiba-wylfa","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-01-17T13:36:53Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power can be green – but at a price","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/17/nuclear-power-can-be-green-but-at-a-price-hitachi-toshiba-wylfa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/jan/17/nuclear-power-can-be-green-but-at-a-price-hitachi-toshiba-wylfa","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power can be green – but at a price","bodyText":"All sources of electricity face the same trilemma in the 21st century: carbon emissions, continuity of supply and cost. The UK government has placed a big bet on nuclear power, but reactors meet only two of the three challenges. Nuclear power is low carbon and a secure source of electricity – but it is hugely expensive. In the era of climate change, generating power without belching out carbon emissions is vital. While building nuclear plants and fuelling them requires concrete, transport and so on, the overall emissions are similar to wind and solar power. All produce far less carbon than coal or gas-powered stations. Nuclear power also largely passes the security of supply test. The giant plants provide steady electricity, 24 hours a day. But there can be blips. The plants are incredibly complex and technical problems can cause long shutdowns. They also need vast amounts of cooling water, which causes problems when drought strikes. The ability to provide “baseload power” is not always an advantage either. Modern electricity grids with growing amounts of renewable energy need flexibility and nuclear power is anything but. Nuclear’s reputation for stability is also being challenged by the crashing cost of energy storage, through new technologies such as banks of batteries and compressed air. These can keep electricity from solar and wind power for times when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing. More interconnectors between nations would also allow greater security – the wind is usually blowing somewhere. Nuclear power’s big problem is its price tag. Building extraordinarily complicated plants and keeping them safe is extremely expensive. Solar and onshore wind power prices have plummeted in recent years and are now about one-third that of nuclear. What’s more, renewable energy’s costs continue to fall, while those for nuclear only seem to go up. The Hinkley nuclear power plant is a decade behind schedule and billions over budget. How to deal with nuclear waste in the long term is another expensive, and as yet unresolved, headache. The industry hopes “small modular reactors” could be cheaper and faster to build. But to fight global warming the world needs low carbon energy now, and no SMR is likely to be generating power in the next 10 years due to lengthy and rigorous safety checks. The UK government faces a difficult decision. It could persist with its nuclear dream, hoping that a way to finance new plants can be found and that they are then built on time and on budget. Or it can pivot towards renewable energy, storage and interconnectors, potentially with gas plants that capture and bury their carbon emissions as back-up. That would mean overturning its antipathy to onshore wind and solar power and ramping up offshore wind even further. Around the world just two nations are currently putting new nuclear plants into service: China and Russia. Overall, nuclear construction is at its lowest for a decade and global nuclear generation has been flat since 2000. Even France, that most nuclear of countries, is planning big cuts in nuclear power. If the UK persists with nuclear, it will be swimming against the international tide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/jul/14/new-uk-nuclear-funding-model-could-leave-taxpayers-liable-edf-sizewell","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-14T13:10:57Z","webTitle":"New UK nuclear funding model could leave taxpayers liable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/14/new-uk-nuclear-funding-model-could-leave-taxpayers-liable-edf-sizewell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/jul/14/new-uk-nuclear-funding-model-could-leave-taxpayers-liable-edf-sizewell","fields":{"headline":"New UK nuclear funding model could leave taxpayers liable","bodyText":"The government will set out plans to resuscitate the UK’s struggling nuclear ambitions with a new scheme which would leave taxpayers liable for rising costs or delays. The funding model, expected this week, could help bankroll the multibillion pound plans for a follow-on to EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C project in Somerset, which ministers aim to build at the Sizewell site in Suffolk. It could also resurrect the dormant plans for a £16bn new nuclear reactor at the Wylfa project in North Wales, which fell apart last year due to the high costs of nuclear construction. Government officials are expected to reveal a new financial framework based on the model being used to finance the £4.2bn Thames Tideway tunnel. Under those plans, the government has allowed the super-sewer’s developers to charge customers upfront for the project, and agreed to cover cost overruns above 30% of the budget and step in as a lender if funding dries up. The nuclear plans are expected to be unveiled before parliament’s summer recess at the end of this week, before a long-awaited energy white paper. The policy roadmap will set out the government’s plans for the energy sector as the economy moves towards the UK’s target to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050. The industry is expected to have three months to respond to an official consultation before ministers decide whether to move ahead with the scheme. Senior nuclear industry sources have told government officials and investors that the proposed finance framework, known as a regulated asset base (RAB) model, could lead to lower costs for consumers. The plans would hand developers an upfront regulated return on their investment at each new phase of the project. This could encourage more investment from infrastructure and pension funds and better borrowing terms for the developer. Government officials are under pressure to find a new way to finance nuclear projects after the National Audit Office condemned the 35-year deal to support the Hinkley Point project through energy bills at a cost of £92.50 for every megawatt-hour of electricity it produces. The average electricity price in the UK last year was between £55 and £65 per megawatt-hour. The watchdog accused ministers of putting energy bill payers on the hook for a “risky and expensive” project which offers “uncertain strategic and economic benefits”. The new financing plan has already raised concerns that applying the Tideway model to a nuclear project that costs £20bn and takes around a decade to build could leave taxpayers exposed to a far higher financial risk. Nuclear projects have suffered high-profile delays and multibillion-pound cost overruns in recent years, making them almost impossible to finance without state intervention. EDF said last month that its struggling French nuclear project at Flamanville could be delayed by another three years to repair eight faulty weldings discovered at the site. The latest delay could push Flamanville’s start date, originally in 2012, to 2022. The project was expected to cost about €3bn when construction began but the latest estimates put its cost at almost €11bn. EDF Energy has claimed the risk to taxpayers of funding its Sizewell B project would be far lower – almost by a fifth – because it is a copy of the same design for build Hinkley Point C. The Sizewell project could even be competitive with the cost of offshore wind, according to the firm, once the cost of backing up windfarms when the wind doesn’t blow is taken into account. On a standalone basis, nuclear electricity would cost more than wind and solar power projects. •This story was amended on 15 July 2019 to clarify the timing of the government’s energy white paper in the sixth paragraph"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/may/31/the-upside-two-ideas-latin-america-make-world-better","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-31T08:50:05Z","webTitle":"The little boy who started his own bank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/31/the-upside-two-ideas-latin-america-make-world-better","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/may/31/the-upside-two-ideas-latin-america-make-world-better","fields":{"headline":"The little boy who started his own bank","bodyText":"Sometimes the answer is a movement, legislation or simply money.

Luxury will pervade everything as society based on waged work becomes as much a relic as the feudal peasant ...” In the doomy world of 2019, to come across this forecast is quite a shock. Enormous optimism about humanity’s long-term future; faith in technology, and in our wise use of it; a guilt-free enthusiasm for material goods; and yet also a belief that an updated form of communism should be 21st-century society’s organising principle – these are Bastani’s main themes. The immediate temptation is to see the book as some sort of joke: a satire, or a political prank. Bastani is a rising young leftwing provocateur, co-founder of Novara Media, the slickest of the guerrilla news and opinion operations that have sprung up in Britain, amid the struggles of mainstream journalism either to properly register the failures of austerity and modern capitalism or to explain the rise of their opponents such as Jeremy Corbyn. Bastani is an effective but slippery broadcaster and online presence: always fluent and flexible, able to switch from fierce defence of Corbynism to cheekier updates on the busy British left’s latest preoccupations, from post-work to the universal basic income. Fully Automated Luxury Communism is a typical Bastani catchphrase – attention-grabbing, armoured against attack with a sparkly coating of irony – and he has been deploying it shamelessly for years in the lead-up to this publication. But is it much more than a catchphrase? In a surprisingly earnest and stiff opening section, he repeatedly lays out the book’s core argument. The world is in an unprecedented crisis – environmental, economic, social, demographic. Yet the left and the green movement’s conventional solution to it – essentially to tame humanity through regulation and self-restraint – is the opposite of what’s needed, Bastani says. Technology, guided by activist leftwing governments, should be used to intensify our “mastery” of the planet, and to extend it to places beyond. The result will not just be our world’s survival, he promises, but the creation of a new world of social justice and limitless abundance, with goods produced at almost no cost, and then freely and equally distributed. Like many futurologists, he bases his predictions on a broad-brush reading of history. So far, he claims, human society has been transformed by two epic, upper-case “Disruptions”: “the domestication of animals and crops”, and the industrial revolution. Both made possible ways of life that were previously either fantasies or simply unimaginable. A “Third Disruption” is now imminent. Some of its supposed driving forces are familiar stuff – artificial intelligence, solar power – while others sound more far fetched: the mining of asteroids to replenish Earth’s dwindling supplies of minerals; the replacement of most edible meat with synthetic flesh. The latter process, Bastani writes, will be “likely” to include “using a 3D printer to ‘print’ steaks”. It certainly makes a change from his day job sticking up for British politics’ most famous vegetarian. In fact, much of the book is light on politics, focusing instead on recent and impending technological breakthroughs, in a manner more familiar from upbeat technology magazines such as Wired than the rigorously pessimistic leftwing volumes Verso usually publishes. But Bastani writes with pace, economy and infectious enthusiasm, and he solidifies his most speculative chapters, to an extent, with some telling facts. “Global solar [power] capacity … increased by a factor of 100 between 2004 and 2014,” he points out. And later: “Luxembourg [has] already begun to create the legal frameworks for asteroid mining companies to base themselves in the Duchy.” The beginnings of the future he wants are already here. There are practical challenges still, he admits, deploying phrases such as “once the technical barriers are surmounted”. But these cautions are rare and brief. Bastani doesn’t say so explicitly, but he is really an accelerationist, one of a small but influential line of thinkers, active in Britain since the 1990s, first mainly on the right, now increasingly on the left, who believe that the best path for humanity is to go faster, in all senses. “We must grasp the opportunities of the new world,” he writes, “rather than dwell on those … social mores which are quickly moving into the slipstream of history.” It’s easy to snort at, or feel unsettled by, such moments of Lenin-goes-to-Silicon-Valley rhetoric. Bastani’s vast proposals sometimes lack the relatively human scale and rootedness in history of the schemes, similar in optimism and intent, currently being promoted by other leftists as a Green New Deal. Yet sometimes the nimbler Bastani persona lightens these pages. A clever passage uses the London “Horse Manure Crisis” of 1894, when the then huge number of horses being used in the capital led the Times to wonder whether it would become uninhabitable, to demonstrate that supposedly lethal threats to the environment can be overcome by technology with unexpected swiftness. Within a few years of the panic, motorised transport became common, the London horse population collapsed, and the threat of manure-buried streets evaporated. “A few short decades from now,” Bastani concludes, “the seemingly terminal [environmental] problems of today will appear as absurd.” You don’t have to share his confidence about that to agree with his suggestion that the apocalyptic is a mode that the media and many of its consumers slip into too easily – sometimes for commercial or psychological rather than rational reasons – and that episodes of mistaken doom-mongering are too easily forgotten. But he does concede that there is a bigger obstacle than pessimism, or “technical barriers”, to the creation of a sustainable and fair world. The problem is political: the stranglehold of short-termist corporations over most economic life and governments. It’s a predictable bogeyman for a book of this sort, but a persuasive one. As long as such capitalists dominate the development and deployment of technology, he argues, its potential to achieve higher social and environmental goals will not be realised. Even the most adventurous space exploration firms, which he at first profiles with great enthusiasm, are ultimately too unambitious and profit-driven for his liking. In his final chapters, Bastani sketches how governments and citizens could make companies act differently, and also expand the space for developing technology outside capitalism altogether. He suggests that Corbyn’s Labour party, and in particular the shadow chancellor John McDonnell and his technologically literate young advisers and proteges, are on the right path. But it’s a long haul from “growing the worker-owned economy” and establishing new British “regional investment bodies”, as the book slightly blandly summarises the McDonnell approach, to establishing the new global society Bastani envisages, with almost limitless public services and consumer commodities, all of them either free or affordable to all, and environmentally sustainable. Some readers will finish this book exhilarated and energised. Others will be unconvinced, or utterly baffled. There are more ideas crammed in here than in a whole shelf of standard politics books. And in today’s fraught world, the time to read whole shelves of politics books may have passed. • Fully Automated Luxury Communism is published by Verso (£16.99).

Burston says the One Nation leader accused him of sexual harassment on social media, via a text message to his wife, Rosalyn Burston, and during a television interview. The 74-year-old denies all allegations as entirely fabricated. Mirvac seeks to evict lessee of 10 Travelodge hotels Property developer Mirvac has launched urgent court proceedings against the lessee of 10 Travelodge hotels, seeking to evict them ahead of a scheduled sale of the properties. AAP reports that in the NSW Supreme Court lawsuit, Mirvac seeks orders that leases with Value Lodging be terminated so an acquisition of the hotels by fund manager Salter Brothers can go ahead. The leases, which began in June 2020, relate to properties in Sydney, Perth, Melbourne and Brisbane. Mirvac sought to terminate the contracts after the sale to the Salter Brothers was confirmed in July 2021. Despite being served with the notices of termination in March this year, Value Lodging refused to vacate the premises, claiming the notices were invalid and disputing the notice period given to move out. Mirvac has sought urgent declarations from the court, claiming the acquisition of the properties by Salter Brothers depends on the hotels being vacant. “(If) vacant possession of the properties is not delivered by Mirvac by 30 June 2022, Mirvac will incur financing costs, time value of money costs, direct interest costs, and opportunity costs,” wrote Mirvac’s solicitor Jonathan Light in an affidavit. As well as the declarations, Mirvac is also seeking its legal costs. The case is being heard by Justice Rowan Darke. Clive Palmer’s United Australia party spent nearly $1.5m on Google advertising on the last day of the election alone, as political parties poured millions into social media posts in the dying days of the federal campaign despite the advertising “blackout” period. Queensland coalminers in the dark about royalties increase Coalminers still don’t know how much tax they will be paying in Queensland in three weeks’ time, AAP reports. State treasurer Cameron Dick says miners will pay more tax on each tonne of coal sold, known as royalties, next financial year. He is yet to reveal the size of the hike coming in the June 21 budget. “It’ll be fair for the industry, but very importantly it’ll be fair for the people of our state,” Dick told reporters on Thursday. The Queensland Resources Council said the treasurer refused to reveal the new royalty rates in meeting with miners on Wednesday. “(That) flies in the face of Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s promise to be an open and transparent government,” the QRC told AAP in a statement on Thursday. “The coal industry is facing a rate rise in two weeks, and does not know what to expect.” The QRC has warned that a royalty hike will scare away foreign investors, but Mr Dick denies that will happen. The treasurer also insists he is still a friend of the mining industry. “But the point of being a friend, and the value of friendship, is being able to tell the truth,” Dick said. “And the truth is that these companies have been making very significant amounts of money.” The New South Wales supreme court has dismissed an application from cosmetic surgeon Joseph Ajaka for Nine’s 60 Minutes to hand over copies of a program about him. In a brief hearing Justice Stephen Rothman handed down his decision on Thursday afternoon with the words “submission dismissed” and ordered that Ajaka pay Nine’s costs. He has not yet published his reasons. On Wednesday the NSW court of appeal ruled that the supreme court did not have power to make its initial document discovery order on 13 May which said 60 Minutes should hand over a draft copy of the story. Chief Justice Andrew Bell said that legal counsel for Ajaka had conceded the orders “made by Justice Rothman on the afternoon of 13th May 2022 were not sustained by any jurisdiction in the court. Those orders must therefore be set aside”. Last month Ajaka won a court order at the eleventh hour preventing the broadcast of the program, reported by award-winning investigative journalist Adele Ferguson, and the publication of any subsequent articles in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. In case you missed how definitive the energy minister, Chris Bowen, was about a nuclear energy debate. Tasmania expedites inquest into deaths of children in jumping castle tragedy A joint public inquest into the deaths of six children in a freak jumping castle mishap in Tasmania has been given priority by the state coroner, AAP reports. The Hillcrest primary school students were enjoying end-of-year celebrations in December when a gust of wind flung the castle and several inflatable Zorb balls about 10 metres into the air. Three other students suffered serious injuries and spent time in hospital. Tasmania’s coronial division on Thursday indicated a joint inquest would be held into the tragedy and a “large amount” of investigative work had already taken place. “The coroner (Olivia McTaggart) wishes to advise that she will give priority to scheduling the inquest as soon as reasonably possible,” a statement from the division said. Evidence from Tasmania Police, including witness statements, has been provided to the coroner. Information from a Work Safe Tasmania investigation concerning the involved business, equipment and set-up will soon be provided. The coroner will likely consider evidence from engineering and scientific experts, as well as meteorology experts in relation to weather conditions. Jalailah Jayne-Marie Jones, Addison Stewart, Jye Sheehan, Zane Mellor, Peter Dodt and Chace Harrison were remembered at funerals in the northwest city of Devonport. Tributes left outside the school were collected by the Devonport City Council for the creation of a permanent memorial. Jones accuses Dutton of leaking sensitive information Jones accuses the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, of leaking confidential information in revealing he was in discussions to buy stop-gap submarines from the United States before the election. Jones: I’d have thought that Peter Dutton might have learned from the mistakes of Scott Morrison about disclosing confidential information between world leaders. In that case, Emmanuel Macron by text message. This isn’t the way a grown-up conducts international relations, let alone sensitive military negotiations with a partner, a defence partner. Grown-ups don’t do that. He didn’t say whether the information was classified or not: Whether it was classified or not, it was certainly sensitive and it certainly compromised our defence partners and our allies and the United States. You don’t do this stuff. Stephen Jones: We must make it easier for super funds to invest locally The assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, is on ABC’s afternoon briefing. He says he wants to make it easier for superannuation funds to invest locally, arguing the changes made by the former government made it more attractive for the funds to invest overseas. Jones: Funds want to invest in Australia, these are patriotic institutions and members want to see their funds making Australia stronger, better, wealthy and we can do all of those things without compromising returns so we will level the playing field and ensure, unlike the last government, we don’t put in place adverse incentives where crazily it is easier to invest overseas than to invest in Australia. He says the government won’t be like the former government in raiding superannuation to fund home deposits: We don’t think Australians should have to choose between having a retirement savings nest, a nest egg for their retirement savings, and buy a house. They should do both. Rio Tinto will invest in large-scale wind and solar farms in central and southern Queensland to power its aluminium operations in the Gladstone region, AAP reports. The resources giant’s aluminium chief Ivan Vella on Thursday announced a call-out for proposals to meet the energy needs of the Boyne smelter, the Yarwun alumina refinery and the Queensland alumina refinery. “It is early in the process, but this is an important step towards meeting our group climate change target of halving our emissions by the end of the decade (from 2018 levels),” Vella said. At least 4000 megawatts of wind and solar power will be needed to run the facilities, roughly the equivalent of two coal-fired power plants. “This is an important moment for Queensland,” Australian Conservation Foundation Gladstone campaigner Jaclyn McCosker said. “Coupled with the news that energy ministers have agreed to come up with a national transition plan to phase out fossil fuels, this marks a significant moment in Australian action to tackle climate change.” Rio Tinto’s pitch to renewable energy developers follows the signing last October of a statement of cooperation with the Queensland government to establish more renewable energy sources in the regions. The new wind and solar projects will have to start supplying power to Rio Tinto’s Gladstone operations through the Queensland grid by 2030, but there are concerns transmission infrastructure is falling short. “In Central and Northern Queensland there’s currently a cap on how much clean energy can be developed locally because there’s a dire need to upgrade grid infrastructure,” Solar Citizens spokeswoman Stephanie Gray said. Queensland Minister for Energy Mick de Brenni has been contacted for comment on grid stress. Work has also begun on the $2bn state-owned MacIntyre wind farm in the Southern Downs, which will be one of the largest in the southern hemisphere. The federal Labor government has pledged $20bn to finance more grid infrastructure, and plans to accelerate new renewable energy, battery storage and transmission nationwide. Bill allowing Labor to cost policies in lead-up to NSW election passes lower house The NSW parliament is closer to passing legislation allowing the Labor party to cost its policies in the lead-up to next year’s state election, AAP reports. A Labor bill passed in the lower house on Thursday allowing all promises made in the lead-up to the March election to be scrutinised from an earlier date. The legislation would see the parliamentary budget office (PBO) begin operating from 1 July, two months earlier than the usual 1 September. The PBO is an apolitical team of professionals which provides costings of all election promises. The Parliamentary Budget Officer Amendment Bill 2022 passed the lower house by division on Thursday, 43 to 39 and will be sent to the upper house for debate. Shadow treasurer Daniel Mookhey said on Tuesday the legislation would ensure all promises made in the lead-up to the 2023 state election could be delivered. Mookhey told media on Thursday Labor had since received advice there was a possibility the PBO could not come online until August – giving staff just one extra month to audit election promises. “This isn’t an opportunity for the government to play politics,” he said. “We want to get a mandate for change for our policies that we will be taking to the election next year.” New trade ministers head to WTO in Geneva The trade minister, Don Farrell and the assistant trade minister, Tim Ayres, have announced they will attend the World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial conference in Geneva from 12 to 15 June. Prior to that, Ayres will be leading Australia’s delegation to the OECD annual ministerial council meeting in Paris on 9 and 10 June. The focus will be supporting governments dealing with Covid-19 challenges, Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, vaccine access, digital trade and food security. Farrell: We will also seek to tackle important longer-term challenges, including by agreeing new rules to limit subsidies that undermine fish stocks, and reinvigorating discussions to reform global agriculture markets. Ayres: In Paris, I will convene a meeting of key WTO Ministers which I will use to press for a package that will address the challenges facing the global trading system, including a response to the pandemic. Some stats from the weekly NSW Health surveillance report on Covid and the flu (via the NSW Health Twitter account): PCR testing decreased, with 170,195 PCR tests reported this week, a 10% decrease since the previous week. The proportion of PCR tests that were positive for Covid-19 decreased to 11%. 460 people with Covid-19 were admitted to hospital and 39 were admitted to ICU this week, which is a decrease on the previous week. There were 86 Covid-19 deaths reported this week. Of these, all were eligible for a third dose of a vaccine but only 54 (63%) had received a third dose. Five of the deaths reported were in people aged under 65 years. The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) is currently the dominant Covid-19 variant circulating in the NSW community, with BA.2 the predominant sub-lineage. The proportion of specimens identified as the BA.5 sub-lineage has been increasing in recent weeks. Of the 53,271 tests conducted for flu at sentinel laboratories, the proportion of positive tests remained relatively stable at around 16-17%. Emergency department presentations for “influenza-like illness” (ILI) requiring an admission have increased to 220 compared to 198 admissions in the previous week. This represents 15% of all ILI emergency department presentations this week. The proportion of presentations that were admitted to hospital was highest for people aged 65 years and over (51%), 35-64 years (18%) and children aged 0-4 years (16%). Pauline Hanson reappears One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has been spotted in public for the first time since she was struck down with Covid-19 just before the election. Hanson had not been seen publicly even after the Covid isolation period, lying low as the election results came in. Hanson looks likely to be re-elected to the Senate again following the May election, but it has been a closely fought contest between her and LNP senator Amanda Stoker over the last Queensland Senate spot. The senator appeared outside the federal court hearing a defamation case between her and former Senate and party colleague Brian Burston. You can read more about that case here: Interest rate rises expected to curtail growth in new home sales Growth in new homes sales declined in May and further falls are anticipated as rising interest rates begin to bite, AAP reports. The Housing Industry Association monthly new home sales report – a survey of the nation’s largest home builders in the five largest states – showed a decline of 5.5% in May compared to a month earlier. HIA economist Tom Devitt said the result was not surprising in a month containing both a federal election and an interest rate hike. He said while sales were strong during the first months of 2022, ongoing increases in interest rates are expected to bring this boom cycle to an end. “The impact of rising rates will be compounded by the ongoing increases in the cost of construction and land, forcing up the cost of a new house and land package,” Devitt said. But he said there is a significant volume of work under construction and elevated levels of work approved but not yet commenced. This will see a significant lag before the rise in the Reserve Bank of Australia’s cash rate adversely impacts on the number of new homes commencing construction. “The lag from when a rate rise results in a decline in starts can be as short as six months, but in this cycle, it could be more than 12 months before the volume of starts fall due to the rise in rates,” he said. The RBA followed up on its 25 basis point increase in May this week with a further 50 basis point hike in the cash rate, taking it to 0.85%. Victoria led the decline in new home sales in May, dropping by 12.7%, followed by NSW and Western Australia, down 12.2% and 0.8% respectively. However, sales rose 8.8% on Queensland and were up 12% in South Australia. Peter Dutton on deportations to New Zealand Dutton also commented on the possibility Labor could water down visa cancellations due to New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s upcoming trip and representations about the policy: The New Zealand government’s been clear in that position for a long time, and I understand that, but we’ve made a decision that we would deport criminals, particularly the most serious people that have committed sexual offences against women and children ... drug dealers, traffickers, people who’ve committed murder, people who weren’t Australian citizens but who committed crimes against Australian citizens and it was right to deport them and we’re safer because of having done so. I don’t want to see the Albanese government walk it back as, you know, we tried to strengthen the laws. They wouldn’t support that and in opposition they were very weak on these deportations, in fact, they were weak in government. Between Scott Morrison, myself, Karen Andrews, we deported about 10,100 of these criminals. And we know that when Labor was in government over the same period they did about 1,100. Now the numbers will drop off again, no doubt, under this government ... yes, I understand why New Zealand wouldn’t want them back but they’re citizens of New Zealand as UK and elsewhere and that’s where they should go back to, so I think we’ve acted in our best interest. If Anthony Albanese tries to wind that back, I think that would be a devastating outcome. Peter Dutton on high court judgement on stripping citizenship Earlier, Peter Dutton also weighed in on the high court’s decision that the home affairs minister’s power to strip dual nationals of Australian citizenship for engaging in suspected terrorist activities are invalid. Duton told 2GB Radio: The government needs to take the advice, to look at the judgment and to work out what the legislative response needs to be, and this needs to happen as a matter of urgency because we don’t want these people paroled and back out on the street and having the opportunity to commit a terrorist offence. The threat of terrorism hasn’t gone away. I mean we, pray God, haven’t seen an attack in London or Paris or in our own country. That doesn’t mean that these people have given up their ideology or that they’re not a threat to to Australians, and we will do whatever we can to support the government to pass legislation. The government is not bringing parliament back till the 26th of July. But if parliament needs to resume next week, or the week after, we will be there and we’ll support them doing that because there is an urgency to this and we need to hear from the attorney general Mark Dreyfus. As to what the answer is, what the legislation response needs to be, and, and we will support any sensible proposal that they put forward. Labor has played down the need for any changes, as only two people will get their citizenship back as a result of the decision – the plaintiff Delil Alexander, and one other. There are also other powers to prevent risks from Australian citizens suspected of terrorism including temporary exclusion orders and control orders. The Centre for National Resilience Covid-19 quarantine facility in the Northern Territory is set to close, chief minister Natasha Fyles says. AAP reports the closure is scheduled for 16 June, and will happen when the territory’s public health emergency ends, along with the vaccine mandate for workers. “The Centre for National Resilience will cease operations, but it will be ready to stand up if we as a territory or Australia need it,” Fyles told reporters on Thursday. “It was that facility that when Covid first appeared in the world got Australians out of situations when they were stuck overseas. “We saw thousands be able to come home through that facility, and it was something Territorians should be proud of.” Fyles acknowledged the hundreds of AUSMAT and NT health staff who worked at the Howard Springs facility since it opened in late 2020. At the centre’s busiest, staff cared for up to 2,000 people per fortnight, but it is currently empty. Fyles said the NT was working with the commonwealth, and the centre would remain on standby for the next 12 months. Also set to end on June 16 are the NT’s virus exclusion zones, rules for high-risk settings, such as aged-care facilities, and safety measures for businesses, with further details set to be released over the next week. Major-event and cruise-ship limits and lock-in areas will also cease, along with the controversial vaccine mandate that required most workers to have three jabs. Fyles said workplaces would now be able to implement their own vaccination policies and decide whether they allowed staff who had lost their jobs for failing to comply with the mandate to return. Darwin’s Covid-19 vaccination and testing centres will close on 30 June. Virus reporting and isolation rules stay, along with face mask requirements for some settings. The chief health officer will also retain the power to issue directions for up to two years, including mandating masks and vaccines, under recently passed legislation. “We must remember as we step forward the threat does remain,’’ Fyles said. The territory’s high vaccination rate and the slowing spread of the virus and its prevalence in the community are behind the decision. The Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, has confirmed a report in the Australian that before the election defence was working on a plan to purchase two Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines from the US by 2030, as a stop-gap before nuclear submarines could be made in Australia. Dutton told 2GB Radio: I thought we could be in a position to make an announcement around July or August. So it was always our intention to not get to the end of the 18 month consultation but to get part way through it, make a decision on which submarine we’re going to go with and then use the balance of the 18 months to work out the detail of that ... I really worried how Labor are walking away from Aukus, from the submarine deal. And that is clearly not in our national interest ... Nuclear powered submarines, particularly with the vertical launch capabilities, provide a great deterrent. So I hope that they can reconsider, because they’re making all sorts of excuses at the moment ... defence is never a priority for them. And that’s what we saw in the last few years. I just think there’s a lot of the language, which is either ill informed, [Albanese] either hasn’t had the briefings yet or is rejecting the advice because the advice was pretty clear and specific to us. And that is that you couldn’t have diesel powered submarine really working in some parts where it needs to work in the shores of our country ... beyond 2035. And if Labor thinks there’s a cheap option here to build a new diesel electric submarine ... then I think that’s folly and it just worries me. Dutton said he “always had [his] suspicions” that Labor “was never truly supportive of Aukus”. “I just get a feeling that they’re preparing the ground to walk away from it and that really concerns me,” he said. A feeling in your waters and a regular Thursday slot on 2GB is all you need, really. Resources minister on security mechanism changes The press conference has now ended with Madeleine King saying she’s not worried about upsetting gas companies with changes to the security mechanism: I’m not worried about putting anyone’s noses out of joint. My priority is to make sure there’s affordable and adequate supply of gas for the eastern states of Australia. Bowen can’t say yet when AEMO might begin to have gas storage up and running He says: We’ll work that through with AEMO. There’s a process. Ministers have agreed so it’s endorsed but now there’s a process of rule making. I’d like to see that happen as quickly as possible. I’m sure that AEMO will make the decisions waiting for the rule making. We met last night. There’s some issues that need to be worked through. He says it won’t happen overnight, and criticises the Coalition for complaining it isn’t being fixed so quickly after just being kicked out of government: We won’t be able to purchase and install gas overnight. That’s true. There’s some rule making changes. If we had this capacity last week it could’ve helped. If AEMO and ministers had this last week, this crisis started to break on Tuesday and Wednesday, we were sworn in on Wednesday, here we are a week later, endorsing the rule change. The Liberal party are saying this isn’t happening quick enough, the Liberal party is like the rock band that trashes the hotel room and complains it’s not cleaned up before breakfast. They created the mess and the new government is fixing the mess. We’re going back to the room. Here are the latest coronavirus case numbers from around Australia on Thursday, as the country records at least 59 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 775 In hospital: 87 (with no one in ICU) NSW Deaths: 21 Cases: 8,201 In hospital: 1,263 (with 40 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 1 Cases: 250 In hospital: 16 (with no one in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 9 Cases: 3,861 In hospital: 297 (with 11 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 0 Cases: 2,801 In hospital: 234 (with 5 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 624 In hospital: 37 (with 1 person in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 22 Cases: 8,903 In hospital: 517 (with 29 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 5 Cases: 7,871 In hospital: 293 (with 16 people in ICU) When asked about the Coalition pushing Labor to explore nuclear as a fuel option, energy minister Chris Bowen says “Bring it on! It’s just a complete joke”. Bowen: Seriously? A couple of points. Nine years in office and then coming up with bright ideas on the other side of the election is point one. No credibility. Point two – nuclear is the most expensive form of energy. We have a cost of living crisis. Energy prices going through the roof. And what’s the big bright idea? They say “let’s have the most expensive form of energy we can possibly think of? Let’s come up with the most expensive form of energy and put that in there because that will make the power prices cheaper?” They want that debate? Bring it on! It’s just a complete joke. Question: Would you consider cash payments for those in dire straits due to [energy prices]? Bowen: The treasurer said that we went to the election with a considerable cost of living package which will be in the October budget. We will sensibly look at anything else that we can do. But we’ll concentrating on that cost relief, cost of living relief, that we went to the election with. Now we are hearing from the resources minister, Madeleine King. King says the Australian domestic gas security mechanism is due to expire on 1 January next year, and the cabinet resolved today to make sure that tool remains so that the government can ensure future supplies of gas in Australia, so the mechanism will be renewed through regulation. The government will also conduct an urgent review of the domestic gas security mechanism. She said: As Minister Bowen has pointed out, it is a long and complicated and convoluted, ineffective mechanism, that takes a very long time to produce results. We are determined to change that and we’re determined to make sure that this mechanism, as well as the other tools available to us, are all on the table so that we can ensure that gas supplies are appropriate, adequate and affordable for Australians right across the country. She said cabinet also agreed to renegotiate the heads of government agreement between the gas companies and the prime minister, with a “distinctive edge” to respond to the gas crisis. We need to have this heads of agreement renewed so that we can again, along with the Domestic Gas Security, ensure that there are gas supplies that are affordable and adequate for the southern Australian states. Bowen says he is pleased with the progress made at last night’s state and territory energy ministers’ meeting. He says the most important thing to emerge from the meeting is giving AEMO the power to store and buy gas. He says: Most importantly from my point of view, working now to give AEMO the power to buy and store gas so that it is kept for a crisis situation and can be released at AEMO’s discretion is something that would have been useful in recent times, and something that will be useful in coming times. Secondly, the state and territory ministers agreeing with me to progress the capacity mechanism process. The previous government had said that they would work towards it coming into place in 2025. We need to do better than that. But we also need to make sure that we get it right, and that includes ensuring that it supports new technologies, renewable energy and storage. And that is the instructions that ministers gave last night. As I’ve said, I am encouraging the Energy Security Board to expedite their work and get it out for further consultation as soon as possible. There will be a lot of detailed work for people to see. There’s been a lot of work done by the Energy Security Board. I look forward to seeing their work being made public in the coming days. Union on ABC ‘knifing’ library services jobs The Community and Public Sector Union has slammed the ABC’s plans to abolish 58 positions and make journalists research and archive their own stories. The CPSU said the ABC cannot continue to sack its world class specialist staff and expect to remain the nation’s most trusted storyteller. CPSU ABC section secretary Sinddy Ealy: This proposal will see over 1,200 hours a week of archival work fall by the wayside, potentially jeopardising national archival footage, music and work. The ABC has developed this proposal before it has even consulted with program makers about what they need from the ABC Archives in order to do their work. This proposal is an unfortunate example of ambitious and future-focused management being out of touch with the day to day running of the organisation, frontline workers are best place to know that automated workflows are not up and running to the level needed to be to avoid catastrophic loss of archival materials and the hasty decision to sack specialist staff will absolutely risk breaking new stories making it to air. This proposal is tech driven not content driven which is highly problematic when it does not have a realistic take on where the organisation is at presently. The last time the ABC took a knife to its library services in 2019, it promised there would no more loss of specialist work, yet here we are. ABC staff are at the frontline of digitisation and the early uptake of technology, they always have been but not at the expense of dumbing down content or quality like this change could see. ACCC report on NBN download speeds The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has said 14% of fibre-to-the-node NBN connections struggle to get speeds over 75% of what they’re paying for. The data is contained in the latest measuring broadband report from the ACCC, which is released every three months looking at how the national broadband network is performing. The 14% is up 1% on the previous report, the ACCC said. “The ACCC has consistently called for NBN Co and retailers to improve these physical connections so that consumers on fibre to the node technology achieve speeds closer to their plan speed,” ACCC commissioner Anna Brakey said. The report found that download speeds in urban areas had improved, from 85.7% of the promised speed in 2018 to 98.2% in February this year. Regional areas have improved from 83.7% to 95.2% The report found people in urban areas on fixed NBN connections still have better speeds than those on fixed connections in regional areas. “Regional fixed-line services have improved over the last four years, but still have some way to go to be on par with urban connections,” Brakey said. Overall, the average download and upload speeds dropped between December last year and February this year. “Speeds are generally holding up well, however most retailers experienced a small drop in speed in February during the busy evening hours,” Brakey said. NBN Co is already in the process of offering full fibre-to-the-home upgrades to up to 2m homes, and the new Labor government’s policy will see that upgrade offered to a further 1.5m. South Australia has reported zero Covid-19 deaths today, with 2,801 new cases, 234 in hospital and five of those in intensive care. With that, I will pass you on to the sterling Josh Taylor who will be with you for the rest of the day. Western Australia’s premier Mark McGowan has released today’s Covid update. There have been 7,871 new cases reported and five further deaths to 8pm last night. The state’s deaths may date back to previous days and weeks but were reported to WA Health yesterday. There are 293 people being treated in hospital with the virus including 16 people in ICU. Marles to meet defence counterparts from Japan and US Deputy prime minister and defence minister Richard Marles will attend a three-way meeting with Japanese minister of defence Kishi Nobuo and US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin while attending the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore this month. The high level security conference, to take place from 10 June to 12 June, will be his first overseas engagement as defence minister. Senior defence officials from more than 30 nations will be in attendance for speeches and talks on key strategic issues. Marles: I am honoured to represent Australia at such an important forum to discuss security challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region in complex and challenging times. The Indo-Pacific is in the midst of the most consequential strategic alignment of our time. I welcome the role this Dialogue plays in shaping robust conversation on strategic challenges and regional security dynamics. Australia remains committed to working with our partners across the region to promote our shared interests of a peaceful, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific. I look forward to sharing Australia’s strategic outlook at the Dialogue, and outlining our regional priorities. The three-way meeting with Japan and the US will be the 10th trilateral defence ministers meeting to take place. ABC chief questioned over archivist jobs The ABC managing director, David Anderson, has been door-stopped at Parliament House in Canberra about the proposal to slash 58 archivist and librarian jobs at the public broadcaster. Anderson told reporters: The archives initiative is something the ABC has had in train for a while, we’ve been digitising the archives, making it more accessible for our content makers. That’s all I have to say about it. We’re in consultation, so when we launch these initiatives ... we consult with staff and their representatives, and that will take place over the next six weeks. Asked if it will compromise the ability to tell Australian stories if only flagship programs have access to library staff, Anderson replied: No, we don’t believe that it will compromise our ability to tell local stories. We do value our archives. We work closely with the National Archives Australia. We don’t believe it will. It’s a change we’re putting in place, a transformation for the future - certainly, to allow our content makers to access more easily the archive that we have. Anderson said the ABC is “always there for all Australians, telling stories is what we do”. It’s an initiative we’ve thought through carefully, we will take feedback from people and answer people’s concerns that they might have in this period of time. Anderson said the ABC will meet its legislative obligations in the Archives Act and its charter. In Queensland, detectives have charged two people following the discovery of human remains at the Glass House Mountains on Tuesday. Forensic testing is under way to determine the identity of the remains, however police say they are believed to be those of Donna Howe, a 57-year-old Caboolture woman, who was last seen in late April. Yesterday police executed a search warrant. Two men from Caboolture have both been charged with one count each of murder and misconduct with a corpse. They will appear at Caboolture magistrates court today. Remember the election? Declarations are continuing until next week, while the latest date of the return of writs is 28 June. The AEC has warned for some contests “the entire allowable period” may be needed to complete the count and formally declare the result. NSW superintendent Darrin Batchelor has provided an update on the 11-year-old boy discovered this morning after going missing yesterday afternoon. Christopher was found close to home by a member of the public driving along a road near his house around 9.15am. Batchelor says the woman saw a person matching his description walking along the road, asked him who he was and he said his name was Chris. She gave him some water and a muesli bar and he was “happy to be in some warmth”. It’s fantastic ... we haven’t filled in all the pieces of the puzzle yet but it looks like Christopher went on a little bit of an adventure yesterday afternoon and overnight he put his head down somewhere, we think in some bushland and this morning he was located heading back towards home so it’s a fantastic outcome. He’s been transported to ... hospital for a thorough examination and there’s no visible injuries ... so it looks like at this stage possible mild hypothermia but ... it must’ve been absolutely freezing for him out there. Batchelor said the family was “extremely relieved” and had been distraught with worry overnight. Police asked him a few questions but he was quiet this morning and it hasn’t been confirmed why he left. Bullets fired into home of boxer Justis Huni Australian heavyweight boxing champion Justis Huni’s home has been shot up in a drive-by attack in southern Brisbane, AAP reports. Five bullets were fired into the 23-year-old’s property on Goorong Street in Sunnybank Hills about 4am on Thursday. No one was hurt by the hail of gunfire, but it is understood there were 10 people home at the time of the attack, including children. Despite the terrifying ordeal, the boxing champ stuck to his rigorous training schedule in the lead-up to his heavyweight bout against Joe Goodall at Brisbane’s Nissan Arena next week, with the winner touted for a potential world title shot. Huni’s promoter Sean Lawson told AAP: He actually still went training this morning – got to keep it normal. Ironically enough, they usually wake up at four o’clock ... this morning was a different wake-up call with five bullets through the windows. The gunshots shattered windows in the home’s front lounge room. Lawson insisted Huni remained unrattled by the incident and his preparations had not been derailed for the upcoming contest with Goodall. The undefeated Australian pair were initially due to fight in February before a second Covid-19 infection for Huni put the event on hold. Queensland siege ends A Queensland siege has concluded after more than 18 hours following the arrest of two men. The emergency declaration has been lifted in Nerang, allowing people to return to their homes. The men were under police pursuit in relation to return to prison warrants. The emergency situation was declared shortly after 3.00 yesterday afternoon when a standoff ensued between the police and the two men. ACT moves on drug decriminalisation bill The ACT government has just moved to pass a bill decriminalising possession of small quantities of some illicit drugs. Under territory law enacted a year ago, Canberrans are already able to possess up to 50 grams of dried cannabis and 150 grams of wet cannabis. A (maroon) bridge too far? The Queensland maroons belted it home in last night’s state of origin. If rugby isn’t your thing, state rivalries are sure to wet your whistle. We are still waiting to hear from NSW premier Dominic Perrottet on the loss, with Queensland one step closer to seeing the harbour bridge go maroon. His last post was this cursed image 22 hours ago: New Queensland funding for housing supply The Queensland government has announced $200 million towards essential infrastructure to free up housing supply as part of this year’s state budget. Minister for planning Steven Miles said the funding would be directed towards residential lots in new communities: People and businesses are moving to Queensland in droves to enjoy the economic, job and lifestyle opportunities on offer. This has increased demand for land supply, especially in south-east Queensland. The funding will be supplemented by property developers, who will be required to make co-investments of at least 20% towards the cost of major infrastructure going into their development projects. Victorian opposition criticised for ‘knocking the health system’ In Victoria, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation’s secretary is not impressed by the state opposition’s messaging around healthcare and hospitals throughout the pandemic. The minister for health and aged care, Mark Butler, has announced Covid booster doses will be recommended for at-risk children between 12 and 15 years old. People most at risk of severe disease are encouraged to receive a dose of the Pfizer vaccine from 14 June following Atagi advice. To be eligible for a booster dose, the children must have completed a primary course three or more months ago, and meet one or more of these criteria: Be severely immunocompromised. Have a disability with significant or complex health needs. Have complex and/or multiple health conditions that increase the risk of severe Covid. Atagi is not recommending a booster dose for all children between 12 and 15 years old at this stage, as evidence shows otherwise healthy adolescents who have received two doses remain “well protected” against severe disease. Butler said: I welcome Atagi’s advice to make boosters available to around 120,000 vulnerable young Australians who have significant health conditions. I encourage all those eligible for these boosters to book in. Atagi recommended all Australians receive an influenza vaccine as soon as possible, because after a few flu seasons with low transmission rates, there is a chance this season could be a difficult one. Protect yourself and your family this winter by getting boosted and vaccinated for Covid and influenza. Police investigate Brisbane shooting Queensland Police are investigating after multiple shots were fired into a house at Sunnybank Hills in Brisbane’s outer south this morning. Around 4am, police were called to Goorong Street after reports of loud noises and vehicles driving off at speed. Three hours later, officers were called back to a property on the same street where at least five shots had been fired into a property. A number of occupants were home at the time, but nobody was injured. Casino regulators in New South Wales and Victoria have given approval to the takeover of Crown Resorts by US private equity group Blackstone. It’s one of the last hurdles before Blackstone can take control – it now needs approval by the Western Australia regulator to run Crown’s Perth casino, and a tick-off from the federal court. Shareholders – the largest of which is James Packer – approved the deal last month. The NSW Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority chair, Philip Crawford, said Blackstone had been subject to an extensive probity assessment that focused on its ability to fix the problems identified last year after an inquiry run by former judge Patricia Bergin. Bergin found that Crown facilitated money laundering at its casinos in Sydney and Melbourne and that junket operators who brought in high rollers from overseas were linked to organised crime. Crawford said: As the prospective owner of Crown Resorts, Blackstone has been required to demonstrate the highest standards of probity as well as a commitment to deliver the full suite of operational changes recommended by the Bergin inquiry. This commitment is vital to ensure Crown Sydney is free from criminal influence and properly manages the risks of harm associated with casino activities. We have more on the one-off payment to health workers from Victoria correspondent Benita Kolovos. The Victorian government will offer payments of $3,000 to all staff working in public hospitals and ambulance services in recognition of the challenging circumstances they’ve faced. The premier, Daniel Andrews, this morning announced the payment, as well as free meals for workers who put their hands up to work overnight from July until the end of the year, as part of a $353m package. He says the initiatives represents a “modest but meaningful way to support and retain healthcare workers within the public system”. This is all about encouraging people to take up a few extra shifts if they can, to go from being part time to maybe working some further hours. It’s an investment in making sure that we can get through this most challenging time, winter, but winter during a pandemic. To be eligible for the full $3,000, workers need to be employed by a public health service by 1 July and still be employed on 30 September. The payments will be made in two rounds, one after 15 August and one after 30 September. Those who start between 1 July and 30 September will be eligible for a pro-rata payment. Earlier this week the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, announced a similar $3,000 “appreciation payment” for health workers. The Northern Territory government will lift the Covid vaccine mandate for workers on 16 June. Some Covid rules will remain in place, including isolation of close contacts to positive cases, mask wearing in certain locations and the mandatory reporting of positive rapid antigen tests. Bill Shorten will appear on Insiders this weekend to discuss how to tackle ‘big lettuce’. Kidding. Shorten is serving as minister for government services and minister for the NDIS, so it will be interesting to hear what he has to say about the resignation this week of NDIS chief executive Martin Hoffman. Victorian hospital and ambulance workers to receive one-off payments Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, is following NSW in offering one-off payments to all staff in public hospitals and ambulance services. The $353m package includes free meals for nightshift workers until the end of the year. The first $1,500 payment will be made in mid-August and the second at the end of September. NSW police have officially confirmed the good news that Christopher Wilson has been found. How to deal with mould when renting A very important conversation in my household is how to deal with mould. To open the windows? To turn on the fan? To dehumidify each room to within an inch of its life? Just the other week I found myself knee deep in literature, manually wiping down each of my mould-laden books with eucalyptus spray. Tenants in Sydney have been told by their real estate agency it is “critical” they regularly open windows during winter to restrict the spread of mould, with an agency advising tenants management of mould was their responsibility. Read the story from Stephanie Tran and Cait Kelly here: Missing Sydney boy found It is being reported 11-year-old boy Christopher Wilson who was reported missing in Sydney’s north-west has been found safe and well. Wilson got off a school bus at Annangrove about 3pm yesterday to go home but failed to arrive. A police spokesperson said officers were waiting at the scene and an update on the boy’s status would be provided imminently but they have not released a statement at this time. Lettuce prices could ease from next week, producer says The days of lettuce puns may soon be behind us. One of Australia’s big lettuce producers expects prices for the in-demand vegetable to ease from next week, AAP reports. The chief executive of vegetable producer and supplier Fresh Select, John Said, said the recent heavy rains have had a huge impact on the market: We’ve had two floods. The first one a while ago has saturated our soils and made it very hard for us to plant … A second flood not long ago completely wiped out all the crops we had in the ground. Said said replanting is causing a massive supply gap, with the only lettuce harvestable being the ones that survived the floods. We’re seeing these price hikes because of supply pressure. The farmer has been surprised by the high prices being fetched, with a box of 12 lettuces selling to retailers for up to $100. In some supermarkets lettuces are costing between $10 and $12 each, with some shelves cleared of lettuce entirely. The Victorian producer hoped drier weather will see the supply boosted. Clearly there are just not enough lettuce around, hopefully we will see some reprieve next week. But the peak body for Australian vegetable growers, AusVeg, is warning consumers that prices are likely to remain high because of production pressures and poor weather. “Cost of production pressures have been upon us for 12 or 18 months – it’s been on the increase for some time,” AusVeg’s national public affairs manager, Tyson Cattle, said. Cattle warned consumers that prices are likely to stay high while the cost of production issues continue. New study suggests some breast cancer treatments may have been unnecessary When Jenny* had a mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer, she believed the major surgery to remove her breast, although traumatic, had saved her life. She described feeling “rage” when at a follow-up appointment three years later, she said to her surgeon, “I would probably be dead by now” if she had not received the surgery, to which he replied: “Probably not.” It was only then, after she had already undergone invasive and life-changing treatment, that Jenny learned about “overdiagnosis”. While breast cancer screening programs are essential and save lives, sometimes they also detect lumps that may never go on to cause harm in a woman’s lifetime, leading to overtreatment, and psychological and financial suffering. Man dies in vehicle collision in Melbourne’s west Detectives are investigating a collision in Sunshine West in Melbourne early this morning that claimed the life of a 69-year-old man. Police allege a white Audi sedan was travelling north along Links Road when it collided with a gold Honda sedan travelling east on Glengala Road just before 1am. Both vehicles then crashed into two parked cars on Links Road. The driver of the Honda, a 69-year-old Sunshine West man and sole occupant, died at the scene. Police have been told a number of occupants were inside the Audi at the time of the collision and they were seen running from the scene. One of the occupants, a 22-year-old Wyndham woman, is currently assisting police with their enquiries. NSW daily Covid death toll today includes some from May To clarify, the daily Covid toll in NSW includes 15 deaths that didn’t occur in the latest 24 hour reporting period and date back to mid-May. NSW Health has released today’s Covid update. There have been 8,201 new cases reported and 21 further deaths. There are 1,263 people being treated in hospital with the virus including 40 people in ICU. Victoria’s department of health has released today’s Covid update. There have been 8,903 new cases reported and 22 further deaths. There are 517 people being treated in hospital with the virus including 29 people in ICU. * An earlier version of this post incorrectly listed Victoria as having 5,911 new cases. Blackstone given green light to take over Crown Casino Blackstone has been given the signoff from Victoria’s gambling and casino regulator to take over Crown Casino, with extra conditions in place including a majority independent board of directors, additional auditing requirements and improved information sharing. Negotiations continuing with men in Gold Coast seige, police say Queensland police have been providing an update on the Gold Coast siege. Chris Ahearn, regional crime coordinator for the south-east region said negotiations had continued with two people overnight, who were in police pursuit in relation to return to prison warrants. Shortly after 3pm yesterday afternoon an emergency situation was declared ... in Nerang. As a result of police attending a residence in that location and attempting to engage with two people at that location who police want in relation to some return-to-prison warrants, a standoff had subsequently ensued and a siege has gone on overnight at that location with restrictions in the area and specialist police on site ... negotiations with these occupants of this residence have been under way overnight. What we’d ask is that members of the public avoid that area ... and we ask that any residents within that exclusion zone remain indoors until we resolve this situation. Police are certainly still on the scene there and negotiations are continuing. We are acutely aware of the impact on the local community in that area, with having a situation like this unfolding ... but it’s our intention to resolve it as soon as we can. Anthony Albanese confirms he will live at the Lodge in Canberra The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has done a round of FM interviews mainly talking about how he has hit the ground running, including attending the Quad meeting within hours of being sworn in and his recent trip to Indonesia. On KIIS FM Albanese confirmed he will live at the Lodge in Canberra primarily, but stay at Kirribilli House when he is in Sydney. He knocked back Kyle’s suggestion he put Kirribilli on Airbnb in the meantime, because the AFP probably wouldn’t like that. Albanese spoke about the Chinese fighter jet intercepting Australia’s surveillance flight in the South China Sea. He explained Australia had to stand up for its interests in making a formal complaint about the dangerous incident, because Australia was in international airspace. Jackie O claimed that it was a KIIS producer who kept interjecting during Albanese’s victory speech, but the prime minister said it “added a bit of colour” and he didn’t mind. On WSFM, Albanese spoke about his bamboo bike ride with Joko Widodo. He said: The bamboo bike is probably in customs somewhere, we brought it back on the plane. It was a really nice warm gesture from the [Indonesian] president to go on a bike ride where we had our one on one discussion before we sat down ... For him, it was of great significance, it symbolised both of our humble beginnings, given the positions we now hold. Albanese said Australia’s ambassador had checked if he could ride a bike, and he said yes, because his family didn’t have a car growing up and he only learned to drive in his mid-20s. Albanese: It was good fun although I must say we went really slow at the beginning and I said to the president ‘can we maybe speed up a bit?’ It’s really hard to ride a bike at 1km/h. OECD Economics forecasts Australia’s growth will slow in 2023 Australia is one of the few countries to avoid a downgrade. Gold Coast standoff involves man subject to return-to-prison warrant, police say Here’s the latest on the Queensland siege from AAP. Queensland police are negotiating with two men who have been holed up in a Gold Coast home for more than 16 hours. It is unclear if the pair are armed but parts of Nerang bounded by Riverpark Drive, McLaren Road, Kowhai Place and Inverness Street are locked down on Thursday morning. Paramedics are on standby at the scene and the nearby St Brigid’s primary school will remain shut. The siege began when police arrived in the area to arrest one of the men, who they say is subject to a return-to-prison warrant for allegedly breaching bail conditions. It is believed that man is a high-risk violent offender and connected to two shootings on the Gold Coast in recent days. In one of those incidents a gun was fired at a family’s car as they drove home from dinner in nearby Coolangatta on Saturday night. The bullet shattered the car’s window and was millimetres from directly hitting a 55-year-old man in the front passenger seat. He was treated for a graze to his neck, while his wife and son were not physically harmed. In the early hours of Monday morning multiple shots were fired from a car near the Arundal police beat. No one was injured in the drive-by attack but the bullets hit the building and a police car parked outside. Police are expected to speak about the siege later this morning. Spirit of cooperation among energy ministers, Chris Bowen says The energy minister, Chris Bowen, has been doing the rounds this morning. He also appeared on the Today Show and Sunrise following the first cabinet meeting with state and territory ministers to discuss rising energy prices. He told Today ministers took “steps forward” yesterday, some with quick implementation times and some longer-term plans. I think Australians understand that you don’t undo nine years of policy chaos in one meeting, but Labor, Liberal and Green energy ministers from across the country came together very cooperatively with me in a two-hour meeting. We’ll be quick to implement ... giving Aemo, the energy market operator, the power to buy gas and store it so it can help us through the current crisis into the more immediate future. But we also agreed on plans it will take longer to work through like a national integrated agreement to have all the investments that are needed for the transition to renewables across the board Look, there was a real spirit of cooperation. I think Australians around the country appreciate honesty. There’s no easy answer. I can be honest with them saying state and territory ministers are working really well with the new government. “Thanks minister,” the interview concluded, “he sounds cold doesn’t he?” Bill Shorten has weighed in on the lettuce shortage ... and associated bad puns If you missed this 2016 incident in which Shorten famously asked a shopper what her favourite kind of lettuce was in a truly bizarre supermarket stunt, you’re in for a treat: On the Gold Coast, a standoff between two men and police continues this morning more than 14 hours after it began. An exclusion zone remains in place in the suburb of Nerang following the issuing of an emergency declaration yesterday evening. At 8.30am local time, Queensland police acting superintendent Chris Ahearn will provide an update on the ongoing situation. The exclusion zone encompasses Riverpark Drive, McLaren Road, Kopwhai Place and Inverness Street. Members of the public have been advised to avoid the area and those within the exclusion zone have been asked to remain indoors until further notice. Capacity mechanism is a priority to bring on renewables, energy ministers say The first meeting of energy ministers yesterday evening indicated there will be a new intensity in federal-state-territory coordination. As we detailed here, there are 11 agreements although they will mostly take time to have some effect: Of note from the communique of the meeting was an indication that any plan to build extra capacity of dispatchable electricity is not intended to keep gas and coal in the system. “Energy ministers agreed to advance the work on a capacity mechanism as a priority to bring on renewables and storage to support stability for the national energy market.” Still, the design will be critical, and this “capacity mechanism” will be a fault line of sorts for the energy debate, possibly for years to come. In the meantime, it’s the case of another day and another power price spike, with the highest spot prices this morning in New South Wales. There was another brief “lack of reserve” notice in NSW, since cancelled, but an indication that the market remains tight. And if you would like a tour of the energy landscape, listen in to this Full Story podcast: Independent MP Allegra Spender appeared on the Today Show this morning. Asked what she wanted to see to address the energy crisis, with people “freezing in their homes,” she replied: In a country of Australia ... we have the energy in this country, it is absolutely tragic that people are in that situation. I think that the government can do more and what we’re looking at right now is a crisis in fossil fuel prices – you’re seeing gas prices and coal prices across the world spiking because of the war in the Ukraine. We produce gas and coal, we export that hugely, we need to make sure that Australian consumers are protected from those international price increases that are driven by international circumstances ... Exactly what the government should be doing is working with the gas companies and saying ‘guys, you know people – Australians, families and businesses expect to be able to access affordable energy, you’re making great profits, you’re not paying a lot of corporate tax on the east coast and you’re making great profits because of this spike in prices, you need to come to the party and make sure that Australian consumers and businesses are protected’. Bowen welcomes work on reopening coal-fired plants Bowen also sidestepped confirmations of whether more coal-fired plants would be fired up to open up energy capacity. Government will decide if coal and gas are included – Bowen The energy security board is set to draft its paper in the coming days. But Bowen says the ultimate decision as to whether its recommendations are accepted will be up to the government. Gas will play role in renewable energy transition – Bowen Bowen is asked whether gas will play a role in Australia’s transition to renewable energy. He says he’s said “consistently” that gas has a role to play. There’s been ideology on both sides of this debate, we’ve had the previous government say there is a gas fired recovery, that is a fraud ... we need gas to stabilise while we are building the [renewable] storage and transmission ... we don’t have that infrastructure at the moment. One of the benefits of gas is gas-fired power stations unlike coal-fired power stations can be turned on and off very quickly ... that’s why gas will play a role. Energy retailers support capacity mechanism, Bowen says Bowen is asked whether the retailers accept the government’s agreements to a capacity mechanism which ensures power plants are available to generate electricity when needed. He says he’s done “little else” than talk to retailers in the past week. I’ve been in constant contact with the retailers ... I’ve done little else, and there is support for the capacity mechanism ... we’ll work for a sensible outcome, perhaps not everyone will be happy with the outcome but there’s recognition we need something like this. This is primarily a coal-fired power crisis ... obviously there’s a lot of issues here but at its core this has been led by outages in coal stations. Chris Bowen says Aemo’s new powers will have quickest effect on energy prices The energy minister, Chris Bowen, is appearing on Radio National. Asked if the 11-point plan agreed to by ministers yesterday would have any meaningful short-term effect on energy prices, he replied: It is a big step forward, some of the steps will apply very quickly and others are an agreement to work in the medium term. There was a real spirit of cooperation around the room ... we all agreed we’re in this task together. Bowen said new powers given to energy regulator Aemo would be the quickest to take effect, while new investments in renewables would also be crucial to provide extra capacity. 11-year-old boy reported missing in Sydney’s north-west Fears are held for an 11-year-old boy who’s gone missing in Sydney’s north-west after temperatures plummeted to four degrees overnight, AAP reports. Christopher Wilson got off a school bus on Annangrove Road, Annangrove, about 3pm on Wednesday to go home but failed to arrive, New South Wales police said. He was wearing his school uniform – a blue T-shirt with maroon and white trim, grey shorts, and red and black shoes. He was spotted walking along Annangrove Road towards Rouse Hill about 4.45pm, wearing a black and white jacket and carrying a black backpack. A search of the area overnight by local police, PolAir, Police Rescue and 15 members of the SES was unsuccessful and will resume on Thursday morning. Police are concerned for Christopher’s welfare due to his age and because temperatures dropped to just four degrees overnight. He is described as being of Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander appearance, about 120cm tall, of slim build, with short brown hair and brown eyes. New European ambassador to Australia announced The EU special envoy for the Indo-Pacific, Gabriele Visentin, has been announced as the next European ambassador in Australia. Australian federal and state governments have reached 11 agreements including prioritising a move to renewable energy following the first meeting of energy ministers to address rising prices hitting the nation. They include setting up a new gas storage reserve, proceeding with plans to build up spare electricity capacity and developing a national transition plan to reduce greenhouse gases. The Australian Energy Market Operator has been instructed to procure and store gas supplies while regulators will be given more powers to ensure transparency in the sector. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the crisis meeting was constructive, with “steps forward” taken but “no easy fixes” to lowering energy prices. It comes as the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is poised to hold a cabinet meeting today, considering how best to respond to the cost-of-living crisis facing Australians. All of the big four banks have passed on the Reserve Bank’s official cash rate hike to mortgage holders. And the federal government has confirmed a transition in employment services will continue next month as planned. Workforce Australia will replace the job active network for jobseeker recipients, while an “onerous” points-based system will also be rolled out for recipients to maintain their payments.

It’s been a week! Here’s a summary of Friday’s contribution to it: • Prime minister Anthony Albanese announced that national cabinet has unanimously decided to scrap the mandatory five-day Covid-19 isolation rule from 14 October, with the exception of those working in health or aged care. Sick leave payments tied to the isolation period will also be phased out. • Optus has agreed it will pay for the replacement of passports for people caught up in last week’s massive data breach. Meanwhile, the Australian federal police announced Operation Guardian to protect people whose data was leaked from associated crime. • Peak medical bodies the AMA and RACGP called on the federal health minister to again postpone the introduction of strict telehealth rules due to come into place on Saturday. • The wife of Australian economist Prof Sean Turnell, who was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment by Myanmar’s military junta, has said his sentence is “heartbreaking” for his family and pleaded for his release. • Former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith was announced as the new UK high commissioner. • And Ben Boyd national park on the NSW south coast has been officially renamed Beowa national park, after an independent report showed Boyd’s involvement in blackbirding in the mid 1800s was viewed by many at the time as a form of slavery. Thanks so much for sticking with us. Have a lovely Friday night. Got Covid rules questions? We’ve got answers The indefatigable Cait Kelly has all the details on the Covid rule changes, including answers to questions like: what’s changing? What was behind the decision? What should I do if I test positive to Covid? What if that, and I need to go to work? How do I know that I’m not infectious? Find all the answers here: A largely wet long weekend Rain, rain, rain for NSW and ACT next week, though some bursts of sun before Tuesday, the Bureau of Meteorology says. Ben Boyd national park on the NSW south coast has been officially renamed as Beowa national park. State environment minister James Griffin has just made the announcement, saying the chosen new name means “orca” or “killer whale” in Thaua language. The decision to rename the park was made last year by the former environment minister Matt Kean after an independent report showed Boyd’s involvement in blackbirding in the mid 1800s was viewed by many at the time as a form of slavery. Griffin said in a statement on Friday: The Aboriginal community in this area called for us to rename Ben Boyd National Park because of Boyd’s shocking legacy of blackbirding. Through an extensive consultation process with more than 60 representatives from the Aboriginal and South Sea Islander community, we listened and learned, and a new, culturally-appropriate name for this magnificent national park was chosen. The name ‘Beowa’ celebrates the important connection between the park’s coastline and the spiritual lives of its first inhabitants, as well as their beliefs and cultural practices associated with the ocean, in particular orcas. The NSW South Coast has a long history and association with whaling, particularly around Eden, where the relationship between orcas and Aboriginal people goes back thousands of years. I want to sincerely thank the Traditional Custodians for their patience and open involvement in the renaming process. The statement from the minister’s office also includes comments from Faye Campbell, one of Aboriginal representatives involved in the consultation process. Campbell said: We are saltwater people and our ancestors were the best whalers going. My ancestor Budgenbro used to communicate with the killer whales and there are a lot of stories to share, now we can. You can read more about the background to this name change in this story from 2021 by Christopher Knaus: Is it still the Queen’s birthday long weekend? If you live in NSW, Queensland, South Australia or the ACT then you might get Monday 3 October off work – it’s a public holiday in those states. In NSW, SA and the ACT it’s Labour Day, celebrating the vast achievements of Australian workers, including the eight-hour day, most famously (but by far from only) the stonemasons going on strike in 1856 because their bosses wouldn’t agree to reduce their extremely long working hours. In Queensland, though, Monday is a holiday for the monarchy. Here’s the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, explaining what they’re going to call it from now on. Sean Turnell’s family speaks The wife of Australian economist Prof Sean Turnell – who was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment by Myanmar’s military junta – has said his sentence is “heartbreaking” for his family and pleaded for his release. In a statement published in Burmese and English, Ha Vu said her husband’s sentence – imposed after a secret trial in which Turnell was denied proper legal counsel – had devastated his family. She said: It’s heartbreaking for me, our daughter, Sean’s 85-year-old father, and the rest of our family. Sean has been one of Myanmar’s greatest supporters for over 20 years and has worked tirelessly to strengthen Myanmar’s economy. Ha Vu said her husband had already been held in a Myanmar prison for almost two-thirds of his sentence. Please consider the contributions that he has made to Myanmar, and deport him now.

Victoria closes state-run Covid vaccination centres In the end of an era, Victoria is closing its vaccination centres today. Opposition accuses Labor of diplomatic appointments hypocrisy The Coalition has accused the Labor government of “hypocrisy” in announcing several diplomatic postings today. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, Simon Birmingham, said changes to diplomatic postings were “rightly a prerogative of the government of the day”. In a statement, he added: However, it is disappointing to see the curtailing of effective and respected appointments occur under the guise of reducing political appointments at the same time as a Labor political appointment is made. Appointments outside of government officials have made profoundly positive impacts. Think of the relations built and outcomes secured by Kim Beazley or Joe Hockey in Washington. Aukus owes much to the relations built by Arthur Sinodinos and George Brandis, along with our UK FTA. While our trade deal with India and their enhanced role in the Quad has occurred during Barry O’Farrell’s tenure. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, announced earlier today that a replacement for Sinodinos in Washington would be revealed before the completion of his posting in February 2023. She also indicated that Hodgman, the former Tasmanian premier, would finish up as high commissioner to Singapore in February – the same month former NSW premier Barry O’Farrell leaves India. Former Liberal senator Mitch Fifield will conclude as ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations in June. Wong revealed that the former Labor defence and foreign minister Stephen Smith would be heading to London, but only after he completes a defence review ordered by the Albanese government that is due early next year. Birmingham said he acknowledged “the skills and capabilities of Stephen Smith, who is well qualified for the role as Australia’s high commissioner to the UK”. He said the opposition congratulated Smith on his appointment and would support him in his new role: However, Mr Smith will need to manage his work on the Defence Strategic Review carefully to avoid any conflict on Aukus matters, given his new appointment and the crucial decisions yet to be made about the class of nuclear powered submarines that Australia will secure. It is also of concern to see the London post left vacant for so long during sensitive Aukus deliberations, along with unnecessary changes in the Washington post, which is contrary to advice reportedly provided to the Foreign Minister. The government needs to guarantee that these changes will not jeopardise any progress on critical Aukus cooperation. Some happy bird news! Because who doesn’t like birds, especially at Guardian Australia? BirdLife Australia: Peregrine chicks typically fledge around 40 days after hatching, so we’ll be glued to the livestream over the coming weeks as we watch these tiny balls of fluff grow into the rulers of Melbourne’s skies. ⁠ We wish the next generation of Melbourne Peregrines all the best!⁠ ⁠While it gained a cult following through Melbourne’s lockdowns, the livestream was started five years ago by Victorian Peregrine Project (VPP), one of BirdLife’s Raptor Group’s initiatives. Falcons have been living in the nest-box on the building’s ledge since the early 1990s.⁠ ABC defends Hawthorn Football Club reporting The ABC has released a statement addressing “misleading public commentary” against journalist Russell Jackson’s reporting on the Hawthorn Football Club. It has been stated or implied that the three former Hawthorn employees named in the story were denied a fair opportunity to properly respond to the ABC’s reporting. This is incorrect. On Monday 19 September and into the following day all three were contacted multiple times by the ABC, via email, phone call and text message. Also contacted were the media teams at Hawthorn and the Brisbane Lions and the personal management of one of the individuals. They were provided with all relevant information about the allegations. They were asked detailed and open-ended questions that gave them the opportunity to fully respond to all the allegations. After initially receiving no response, the ABC contacted all the parties again and offered them more time in which to respond. We again received no response to the questions. Statements provided by Hawthorn and the AFL were included in the story and the ABC has reported comments that have subsequently been made. While Russell Jackson’s story reports on the existence of the external review commissioned by Hawthorn, and some allegations made within it, his story was not based on that review and does not quote its contents. His reporting was based entirely on original interviews conducted with primary sources after he was alerted to this difficult and important story. His reporting has been accurate, fair and ethical. Back on reactions to the Covid isolation decision, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Foundation (ANMF), which gave Anthony Albanese some big plugs through the election, has savaged the move to scrap mandatory iso. ANMF federal assistant secretary Lori-Anne Sharp: We are yet to see the real impact of dropping the isolation period from seven to five days, let alone removing the isolation period altogether. It’s a risk to remove all COVID safety precautions that will lead to an increase in cases and place further stress on our already stretched health and aged care systems. She voiced fears about “further pressure on our healthcare systems”, and called on national cabinet to be “flexible” in considering reinstating public health orders if and when they may be needed. We believe the suggestion that Covid-isolation is a matter of ‘personal responsibility’ is just a way of Governments shifting their responsibility onto the individual when it should be theirs. But Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has shared a statement giving his backing for the move. My colleague Benita Kolovos asked Andrews (who didn’t get a chance to speak during the earlier press conference) what he thought about the change. His office told her: Victoria supports the unanimous decision taken today and the continuation of a nationally consistent approach. It’s important that additional arrangements remain in place to protect vulnerable Victorians in aged care, disability settings and hospitals. The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) president, Michelle O’Neill, appeared on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing earlier following the national cabinet decision to scrap the mandatory isolation period for Covid-19. She said the ACTU had “said all along” it was important decisions about health were based on the best expert advice, and was concerned at the impact on the one in three workers in Australia without access to paid leave. We understand that this is based on health advice and we also understand that that’s going to be released. So we’re keen to have a look at that. Our worry is always about workers who don’t have access to paid sick leave and even before we were in Covid-19, we were in a pretty shocking situation where one in three workers in Australia don’t have access to paid sick leave and that has got a lot worse over the last decade. This is something that is an underlying problem that we’ve got to fix . We reported this morning that processing times for an important skilled regional worker visa have more than doubled and the number of migrants languishing on bridging visas has increased six-fold. The figures come from a new report by the Migrant Workers Centre, which has also slammed the department of home affairs for under-resourcing its visa processing teams. The report said: An important reason for the visa processing delay and the existing backlog of onshore visa applications is the Department having not allocated enough resources to the services. When it took office, the Labor government said it would treat the visa processing backlog as a priority. It also said it would divert extra staff to help better resource the visa processing area. The Guardian understands that, since May 2022, 215 extra staff have been placed into roles supporting temporary and migration visa processing. Recruitment and training is also expected to fill an extra 500 positions to work through the visa processing backlog. Until then, the Migrant Workers Centre warns that the tenuous nature of bridging visas is putting more and more migrants at risk of exploitation. Its report said: Living on a visa with an impending expiry makes anyone insecure. Australia gains nothing from not allowing people to get settled and making them vulnerable to exploitative work conditions. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, says it has been “pleasing” to see the end of mandatory isolation requirements for Covid-19. It’s time for us all to take responsibility for our actions and get on with life to the greatest extent possible. A controversial $4.5bn fertiliser project near ancient aboriginal rock art in Western Australia has been handed a $220m government loan in a step that has angered campaigners trying to protect the art. Resources minister Madeleine King announced the loan this afternoon for Perdaman’s urea project on the Burrup peninsular, bringing total support for the project from the Northern Australia Infrastructure facility to $455m. The peninsular is the base for three major industrial facilities – Woodside’s gas processing plant, Yuri’s ammonia plant and the Perdaman project – close to ancient rock art and culturally important sites. The loan to the Perdaman project comes a month after the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, refused a request from campaign group Save our Songlines to block the plant. The minister instead requested an assessment of the threat to cultural sites in the area from the three projects. Murujuga traditional custodian Raelene Cooper, a Mardudhunera woman and former chair of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, said: This bailout from the federal government is aimed to reassure investors who are spooked about supporting a project that will remove sacred Murujuga rock art over the objections of Elders. The amount of the money the government have pumped in would be enough to move the Perdaman plant off the Burrup to the Maitland industrial estate, where it would not damage and desecrate Murujuga sacred sites. More concerning and contradictory is the government propping up this toxic project when they have just commissioned a full cultural heritage assessment of all industry on the Burrup. It is bizarre that the Federal government would lash themselves in lockstep with the WA government’s support for toxic industry at the Burrup Hub but this latest Perdaman bailout just gives more proof that no one else is willing to back it. Plibersek visited the peninsular in August and said she denied the request to pause the project because the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation had an agreement with Perdaman over how the cultural sites would be treated. Minister King said on Friday the project would be “transformational” for the state and would cut reliance on urea imports and secure farmers’ access to fertiliser. She said: The project is also a good example of how Naif-funded projects can align with the Government’s net zero agenda. The project has been designed using the best available technology to minimise emissions, with reductions to be achieved in the short to medium term through efficiency gains and solar power imports. The project has committed to net zero by 2050, with an aim to achieve a 45% reduction by 2030. A new parliamentary inquiry will examine how Australia makes decisions to send service personnel into international armed conflict. The inquiry was referred by the minister for defence, Richard Marles, to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Wednesday. JSCFADT chair Shayne Neumann: One of the most significant powers vested in the executive government is the decision to deploy Australian servicemen and women into armed conflict where they are at risk of serious injury and death. This review of course does not alter the fact that Labor’s defence policy is founded on the principle of Australian self-reliance and the government and Australia’s armed forces need to be able to defend Australia and its interests against credible threats in a dynamically changing geo-strategic environment unimpeded by dissenting or short term political opinions. Former Labor minister Stephen Smith has been named as Australia’s next high commissioner to the UK – but the Albanese government has yet to reveal who it will send to Washington. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, defended the political appointment, noting that the London post had long been held by senior former ministers as a sign of the “eminence of Australia’s relationship with the United Kingdom”. Read the full story from Daniel Hurst here: Federal housing minister Julie Collins has responded to the release of the productivity commission’s review of the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement, released today. As we reported this morning, the commission found the $1.6bn intergovernmental agreement to facilitate safe, affordable housing in Australia was “ineffective” and national reform was sorely needed. Among the recommendations were an overhaul of commonwealth rent assistance, a focus on fixing the rental crisis, and winding back concessions and grants for homebuyers in favour of funding stretched homelessness services. Collins released a statement today that characterised the agreement as having “shortcomings” before placing the blame for that at the hands of the previous government: This report confirms that the last decade of policy inaction by the former Liberal-National Government has left us with serious housing challenges across the country. The Albanese Government has an ambitious housing reform agenda to increase supply and improve affordability through the establishment of a National Housing Supply and Affordability Council and the development of a National Housing and Homelessness Plan. The findings from this report will help inform the design and implementation of these reforms. We are also taking immediate action to address housing challenges. The housing and welfare sector has also started to respond as it comes to grips with the 600+ page report. Farah Farouque from Tenants Victoria told Guardian Australia: This is a detailed report, but the big picture it paints confirms yet again how housing affordability challenges are so adversely impacting on renters - especially people on low incomes who have no choice but to rely on the precarity of the private rental market. Along with many others, we believe there should be an increase in the Commonwealth Rent Assistance so it’s good to see the renewed focus on its adequacy - or rather, the inadequacy. Meanwhile, Kristen O’Connell from the Antipoverty Centre saw problems in the report’s recommendations for CRA reforms that included suggestions that market rents could be introduced to public housing under a revised scheme: Housing is a human right. Treating it like a commodity is what caused the housing crisis in the first place. The Productivity Commission report papers over the fundamental problems that have ultimately been caused by chronic underinvestment in public housing and extraordinary tax incentives for property investors. If the government does nothing more than follow these recommendations they will continue to fail us. Read more about the report itself here: A bushwalker has discovered human skeletal remains while hiking along Darwin’s outskirts, AAP reports. Northern Territory police have established a crime scene near Lee Point Beach, about 20km north of the CBD. The remains were discovered on Wednesday and a large number of bones, including a skull, have been recovered. Detective acting superintendent Karl Day said on Friday: The scene has been painstakingly processed with the use of medical experts, including a forensic pathologist. Further analysis will be undertaken by forensic specialists and until that time we cannot expand further. He of the electoral expertise, Antony Green, has made some interesting comments about Victoria’s upcoming election, and a quirk in the state process regarding Senate ballots. The short version: how you number your ballots matters! Further downthread, he says the Bracks government implemented this system. “They copied the Senate system then in place. Every other jurisdiction has since abolished the system but Victoria hasn’t.” Peak medical bodies are calling on the federal health minister to again postpone the introduction of strict telehealth rules due to come into place on Saturday. The Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners have sent a joint letter to Mark Butler urging him to delay the introduction of the of the 30/20 rule, pressing the Covid pandemic isn’t over with further waves expected later in the year. The rule would result in any GP providing more than 30 daily telephone consults on 20 or more days over a 12-month period being referred to the professional services review – the body responsible for reviewing possibly inappropriate practice at the extreme end of non-compliance. It was initially due to come into effect on 1 July, but was delayed to “at least September” following lobbying by the RACGP. Karen Price, adjunct professor and RACGP president, said telehealth consults remained an essential service, particularly for vulnerable patients unable or unwilling to use videoconferencing: This pandemic is not over and now is not the time to tie our hands behind our backs. Ask any GP and they will tell you that being able to utilise phone-based services for patients remains a vital tool. Phone consults are especially useful when patients are Covid-19-positive, a close contact of someone with the virus or when the practice has multiple staff down with Covid-19. Keep in mind too that many patients still aren’t confident or comfortable using video technology for telehealth consults, so phone services remain an essential option. This is no time for complacency and no time to limit a tool that we can use to help our patients, especially older people and those with multiple, chronic conditions that need to be carefully managed through regular consultations. GPs and general practice teams on the frontline are doing all we can to ensure patients get the care they need when they need it. The RACGP has been calling for longer telephone consultations to become a permanent fixture of telehealth and for Medicare phone items for chronic disease management and mental health services to be reinstated as part of the permanent telehealth model. Thanks Natasha for all your work today! I’ll be with you through to this evening. Stick with us as we wrap up this big week of news. This is where I leave you in the very excellent hands of Stephanie Convery. Have a good weekend! Backlash from crossbench and experts against national cabinet decision to scrap mandatory isolation National cabinet’s decision to scrap Covid isolation was said to be unanimous among first ministers at the meeting, but not everyone agrees – with a number of doctors and other politicians already voicing concerns and opposition to the change. Dr Monique Ryan, the member for Kooyong and a paediatric neurologist, called for the health advice on the move to be made public, saying it was “deeply disturbing” if the decision hadn’t been considered by expert medical panels. Ryan said in a statement: All health advice provided to national cabinet, including the health advice upon which this decision was based and the minutes from today’s national cabinet meeting must be made available for public scrutiny. At this stage, it is unclear if the decision to scrap isolation requirements was considered by the Health Advisory Committee. This is deeply disturbing and must be clarified to the public. At the national cabinet press conference, chief medical officer Paul Kelly said the health advisory committee “haven’t specifically discussed this matter”. Prime minister Anthony Albanese was asked if it had been discussed by the Australian health protection principal committee, the grouping of each state’s chief health officer. Albanese didn’t answer that specifically, and would only say, “It was a unanimous decision by the national cabinet.” Ryan raised concerns that sick people would return to work without mandatory isolation and the provision of sick leave payments by government. She said: Removing Covid 19 isolation will have significant impacts on our local and national economies and on workforces that are already struggling with absenteeism, both from Covid infection and reinfection and from the emerging public health crisis of long Covid. Numerous infectious disease and public health experts also weighed in with their concerns: Professor Brendan Crabb, of the Burnet Institute, told the ABC he found the change “disappointing”, “illogical” and “distressing.” Rally held in environment minister’s backyard for Save the Koala Day We brought you the news a little earlier of the alarm bells the Australian Koala Foundation are ringing on National Save the Koala Day. Earlier today, protesters took to the streets of Manly, which is the seat of NSW environment minister James Griffin, with banners and signs advocating for the beloved marsupial. Members of Save Sydney’s Koalas, the Bob Brown Foundation, Knitting Nanas and the Animal Justice Party all braved drizzly Sydney conditions to demand action to protect koala habitat. Market braces for another RBA rate rise Come next Tuesday, we’ll have another Reserve Bank board meeting, and more than likely another rise in its key interest rate. Three of the four big banks expect we’ll get the fifth rise in the cash rate of 50 basis points in a row, taking it to 2.85%. Assuming the banks all pass the increase on to their borrowers, here’s how much more it will cost for a typical loan, according to RateCity.com.au. For those with a $500,000 loan, the extra monthly payments will be $760 a month. The CBA, Australia’s biggest bank and mortgage issuer, is more conservative (or optimistic), betting the RBA is more likely to go with just a 25bp rise to 2.6%. “We believe the domestic backdrop does not warrant another super‑sized rate hike, particularly given the RBA has recently acknowledged that, ‘the full effects of higher interest rates yet to be felt in mortgage payments’,” said Gareth Aird, the bank’s chief economist. ANZ economists, meanwhile, see the case for 50bp as “reflecting strength in recent domestic data, including solid household spending, ongoing inflation momentum and near-record job vacancies”. However, their expectation is that the central bank will then ‘soften’ its message “by removing the reference to ‘over the months ahead’ in the context of further rate increases”, the economists said. ANZ expects the peak rate will come in at 3.35%, or a full percentage point more than the cash rate is now. Ahead of the RBA’s move, here’s how interest rates in the market stack up (at least among the big banks), according to RateCity.com.au. If the UK serves as any example this past week, you would expect the RBA to avoid sending any mixed messages. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has issued a short statement following the national cabinet decision to end Covid-19 isolation from 14 October: Victoria supports the unanimous decision taken today and the continuation of a nationally consistent approach. It’s important that additional arrangements remain in place to protect vulnerable Victorians in aged care, disability settings and hospitals. New diplomatic postings announced for Singapore, New Delhi, Tokyo and the UN Penny Wong: A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recruitment process will be carried out to appoint experienced public servants as heads of mission in Singapore, New Delhi, Tokyo and at the United Nations in New York. Will Hodgman will conclude as high commissioner in Singapore in February 2023. Barry O’Farrell will conclude as high commissioner in India in 2023. Mitch Fifield will conclude as ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations in June 2023. She also announced the appointment of six career diplomats to lead Australian overseas posts: Dr Simon Twisk as Ambassador to Argentina Dr Axel Wabenhorst as Ambassador to Egypt Ms Melissa Kelly as Ambassador to Kuwait Ms Indra McCormick as Ambassador to Portugal Mr Tony Huber as Consul-General in Istanbul, Türkiye Mr Andrew Goledzinowski AM as Ambassador to Vietnam Our foreign service is the driver of Australia’s engagement with the world. And today, I am announcing a team that complements the existing personnel who we have across the world pursuing Australia’s interests. Can I thank all those who have served Australia, the outgoing ambassadors, high commissioners and consuls generals for their contribution in advancing the nation’s interests in those countries during their respective tenures. The foreign minister, Penny Wong, is speaking in Adelaide. Wong says the government will continue to “advocate strongly” for economist Sean Turnell, who yesterday was sentenced to three years in prison after a closed trial in Myanmar. Wong says the government rejects charges against him and will advocate through public and private channels for his return to Australia. Wong then began to make announcements about new appointments she says will “strengthen Australia’s diplomatic capability and match people with the right qualifications and expertise to senior postings.” I want to make clear our Government is reversing the previous government’s approach and we are rebalancing appointments towards more qualified senior officials consistent with community expectations and position requirements. In circumstances, there is also a clear advantage for Australia to be represented by people who have had distinguished careers beyond the public service such as business people and former Parliamentarians. Wong announced former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith as the new UK high commissioner. The eminence of Australia’s relationship with the United Kingdom has long been reflected in the appointment of the former senior Cabinet Minister. So in keeping with this tradition, the Albanese Government is appointing Steven Smith as Australia’s next High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Mr Smith was a member of the Australian Parliament for 20 years and he served as Minister for Defence and prior to that Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. He will commence his posting after submitting defence strategic review in early 2023. Until then Lynette Wood will continue as Australia’s acting High Commissioner and I thank her for that. A replacement for Arthur Sinodinos will be announced ahead of the completion of his posting in February 2023. There were 3,104 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and one person is in intensive care. OECD upbeat on global minimum tax rate The OECD secretary general, Mathias Cormann, says he is “quietly optimistic” that a global minimum corporate tax rate will be implemented by 2024, AAP reports. Cormann is in Sydney today to close the OECD’s Forum on Tax Administration (FTA) Plenary, which this week hosted officials from around the world focusing on how to boost international tax cooperation. A key issue is implementing an OECD-brokered deal to rewrite cross-border taxation rules to deal with challenges from the digitisation of the economy, including tax avoidance by large multinationals. The “pillar one” portion of the deal would replace unilateral taxes on digital services with a new mechanism enabling multinationals to be taxed in part based on where they sell products and services, rather than where they situate their headquarters and intellectual property. Under the plan’s second pillar, a floor rate would be put under corporate income tax via a minimum global corporate tax rate of 15%, with the aim for countries to use it to protect their tax bases. The former Australian finance minister, in closing remarks, said once a “critical mass” of countries legislated the global minimum it would very quickly become “self-perpetuating”. Cormann said: As It will not be in any country’s interest to leave money on the table for other jurisdictions to collect at their expense. That is why we are quietly optimistic that the momentum is there to ensure that pillar two of this historic agreement will be implemented in time for 2024. Albanese says Optus’s actions “unacceptable” Further to the Optus agreement to pay for replacement passports, prime minister Anthony Albanese has tweeted that the company’s actions were “unacceptable”. In a tweet thread saying Optus would pay for the passports, he said: Australian companies should do everything they can to protect your data. That’s why we’re also reviewing the Privacy Act – and we’re committed to making privacy law stronger. We’re still waiting for an update from Optus to confirm this, and we’ve asked for information about how the company plans to do it, by which date, and how much they expect it to cost. There’s been no word publicly from Optus at all on the passports issue since foreign minister Penny Wong asked them to foot the bill. We’ll keep you posted. “No family should ever have to experience the devastation”: findings from Mackay Base Hospital investigation Inadequate care at the Mackay Base Hospital contributed to the deaths of three children, an independent investigation has found. The report, released by the Queensland government this morning, found “systemic failures” within the hospital’s obstetrics and gynaecology services had caused many women to suffer “sustained lifelong physical and mental harm”. The state’s health minister, Yvette D’Ath, offered her “sincerest and unreserved apology” to the 96 women who participated in the investigation, with 81 women found to have suffered substandard care and 12 more under review. The report said 26 cases resulted in personal injury or harm, while D’Ath said three cases identified inadequate care leading to the loss of three children. Those three cases span over 10 years. No family should ever have to experience the devastation of the loss of a child and certainly not under these circumstances. Our health system can and must do better. At least 40 vehicles have had their tyres slashed in the north-west Melbourne suburbs of Essendon and Moonee Ponds last night. Victoria police are appealing for assistance from the public after the damaged vehicles were found in Buckley Street, Salisbury Street and Primrose Street in Essendon, and Montague Street in Moonee Ponds between 9pm-10pm. In a statement, the police said: Police have spoken to several victims today and would like to hear from any victims who have not yet spoken with police. Investigators would also like to speak with residents in the area with security cameras on their properties. CMO warned PM that further waves of Covid-19 infection “highly likely” Back on Covid isolation being abolished by national cabinet, we can share some interesting details from chief medical officer Paul Kelly’s advice to prime minister Anthony Albanese. The PM’s office shared the letter that Kelly wrote, in which he wrote that the proposed changes were “a reasonable approach”: In the current Australian context of low community transmission and high hybrid immunity from vaccination and recent infection, it is my view that removing mandated isolation requirements in the current period would not materially detract from Australia’s pandemic response and would be consistent with the current aims of that response. However (and this is the point I went to in the question I asked Kelly in the press conference about whether isolation rules might be returned at some point in future), the CMO also specifically notes his advice is tied to this point in time and current trends. While backing the cut to isolation, Kelly also suggested national cabinet commission commission “a detailed transition plan which would adequately prepare Australia to respond to a surge in cases” in the event of a new Covid variant in future. I asked Kelly whether he would ever see a moment where he would provide health advice to reinstate mandatory isolation. He didn’t say no. In his letter, he warned it was “highly likely that further waves of infection will continue to occur over the next two years at least”, citing new virus variants of higher transmissibility or severity, low use of masks and low adherence to public health guidelines. Kelly warned Australia would need “constant vigilance and a strong commitment as well as continued capacity to surge the response”. Just on that koala story, the reason we’re hearing the warnings today is because it has been dubbed “Save the Koala day” by the Australian Koala Foundation. I highly recommend you have a look at this useful explainer from Guardian Australia’s environment reporter, Lisa Cox. Koalas at risk of extinction, experts warn One of Australia’s most iconic native animals is at risk of being functionally extinct and urgent government action is needed, according to wildlife experts, via AAP. Over the past two decades, koala populations have nearly halved because of urban expansion, loss of habitat, disease and climate change, and experts believe they remain under threat. Rolf Schlagloth, Central Queensland University’s koala ecologist, said: There is a risk of extinction. The time frame is pretty difficult to determine. The biggest threat has always been and still is the loss and the fragmentation of habitat. We are still losing more habitat every year, and in some states it’s worse than others. Exact koala population figures are largely unknown because of the 2019-20 bushfires, but government estimates show in 2001 there were roughly 184,748 koalas in Queensland, NSW and the ACT. By 2021 this figure had dropped to about 92,184. It is estimated there are about 450,000 koalas in Victoria, but this figure is often disputed. Post-covid flight cancellations continue The Australian singer-songwriter Alexandra Lynn, known better as Alex the Astronaut, has taken to social media to reveal the trouble Lynn’s drummer has had in travelling from Sydney to Brisbane with the national carrier. It comes as the entire travel industry struggles to get back to the pre-Covid normal. Optus will pay for the replacement of passports for people caught up in the data breach, prime minister Anthony Albanese has announced. The foreign minister, Penny Wong, wrote to Optus earlier in the week calling on the company to pay for replacement passports for those who had their passport numbers exposed in the leak. Today, Albanese said Optus had agreed to the request. He said: Optus have responded to my request that I made both in the parliament and that senator Wong made in writing to Optus [confirming] they will cover the costs of replacing affected customers’ passports. I think that’s entirely appropriate. I find it extraordinary that the federal opposition called upon taxpayers to foot the bill. It’s been a busy hour with announcements from both the national cabinet about scrapping Covid-19 isolation period and the Australian Federal Police revealing a new operation in relation to the Optus breach. (Suffice to say the team at the Guardian heartily approve of its new name) Both those press conferences are over now, but if you want to read more about Operation Guardian, my colleague Josh Taylor has this report: ‘Isolation itself cannot be seen in isolation’: chief medical officer Just circling back to the to those opening comments from chief medical officer Paul Kelly who spoke about how the government is balancing the need to move away from Covid-19 exceptionalism at the same time as acknowledging the infectiousness of the virus: It is a time, though, now to consider that we have other things that we can do to protect those most vulnerable people, and that is absolutely our key aim. Isolation itself cannot be seen in isolation. It needs to be seen in the context of that high vaccination rate, high previous infection giving further protection, the availability of treatments, the availability of vaccines, including the new … vaccines and all the measures we have in place to protect vulnerable people where they are. It is time to move away from Covid exceptionalism, in my view, and thinking about what we should do to protect people from any respiratory disease. That does not mean we have somehow magically changed the infectiousness of this virus. It is still infectious. This is an important epidemiological point: We can’t look at isolation by itself. We need to look at those measures and the protections we have as well as other protections. It is important that we keep an option for a change to these settings in the future … to keep that vigilance for new variants, for example, for changes in the epidemiological situation in Australia, for signs that we have strain on our health care system, and be prepared to make different decisions at the that moment. For now, as I’ve stated, I believe removing isolation at this time is a reasonable cause of action from the public health point of view. ‘There’s not a role for government in running every bit of people’s lives forever’: Albanese Back to the Covid-19 isolation period being scrapped. Journalists are asking Albanese about treating Covid like the flu or any other kind of virus: Q: It’s pretty clear that Covid does have long-term implications for some people who do get it. Number one what, are you doing to help people who may have those more long-term issues with Covid infections, and for Prof Kelly, are you expecting an impact on the general population by having Covid more freely spreading and how will that work with people getting long Covid? Albanese: [As] public decision-makers we have a responsibility to listen to the health advice but we’ve also got a responsibility to make decisions which are proportionate. That is what we have done. Covid is still out there. We understand that, we talked about that need to continue to run campaigns to get people vaccinated. We continue to provide support in high-risk areas. We’ll continue to monitor these issues and we’ll have another discussion in December. But as prof Kelly said, we’re making the decisions based upon the circumstances we’re in right now, just as [in] over the winter period – where we had a combination of an increase in Covid infections, with a severe flu season as well – that had a combined impact on the health system that required a continuation of emergency measures. … The nature of emergency measures is that they’re not there with no end date in sight. And it would not be responsible to do so because if this was a media conference, a year ago, a whole range of things would’ve been different … People are responding differently. I was at the MCG last week with just over 100,000 people. That was not happening, borders were closed. We are changing our position based upon changing advice and changing circumstances. And that has to occur. There’s not a role for government in running every bit of people’s lives forever. And that is my firm position. You know, this isn’t an ideological thing. This is a practical outcome that was agreed across the board. Albanese is asked about the Optus breach and whether the Telco has responded to government calls for them to pay for replacement passports for affected customers. I think that’s entirely appropriate. I find it extraordinary that the federal opposition called upon taxpayers to foot the bill. I note Paul Fletcher’s comments that attempted to play politics with this issue and blame the government, him having sat in a cabinet for nine years and his failure to provide any criticism on a serious level on Optus. I leave Mr Fletcher to explain why that was the case. Albanese emphasises need to move away from ‘Covid exceptionalism’ Back to lifting mandatory Covid isolation and the lifting of Covid payments: what is the incentive for a casual worker to stay at home when they are sick if they risk not getting any money if they stay home? Albanese: One of the statements that Prof Kelly has used here today … was moving away from ‘Covid exceptionalism’. The flu has existed, and health issues have existed, for a long period of time, and the government hasn’t always stepped in to pay people’s wages while people have health concerns. It is not sustainable to have in place a system whereby the government steps in permanently. We understand the pressures that are there, it is one reason why my government has focused as well on reducing the incidence of casual work and … the priority for my government is on creating permanent work, permanent employment, it’s one of the risks that there with the increased casualisation of the workforce that we have seen. The head of the Australian Medical Association, Prof Steve Robson, had earlier told ABC News Breakfast: If you think the flu is Covid, you’re living in fantasy land. Covid is long-term infectious, we’re already seeing a massive effect of long Covid on the workforce and the community. You don’t have it with long flu or long cold. It’s fantasy. Albanese: ‘it’s never been about the dollars, it’s about good health outcomes’ Albanese is asked about his agreement to work further on policy options for patients pathways and reducing pressure on hospitals. Does that mean the government is looking at eight separate deals of the national 50-50 funding agreements for hospital funding? Look, we will continue to discuss healthcare as long as the commonwealth and states exist … That’s just a reality of the system which is there. But one of the things that we have agreed, and we have made this point before, is that it isn’t just about a dollar amount. Part of the pressure that’s now in emergency departments is people who should not be going to hospitals but are going because there isn’t primary healthcare available, because people in nursing homes don’t have access to healthcare, so someone who is an aged care resident who could have been assisted by having a nurse in a nursing home as identified by the aged care royal commission, and ends in the emergency department because health concerns become acute rather than dealt with in a timely manner. There are people with disabilities who end up in emergency departments and in hospitals as well. We’ll continue to work on ways in which we can get better health outcomes … it’s never been about the dollars, it’s been about making sure that we get good health outcomes in the interests of the population. … Others are continuing to work on that, and we will have more to say in the future including at the December meeting of the national cabinet. Kelly: We will continue to monitor aged care going forward Guardian Australia’s very own Josh Butler asks Paul Kelly two questions: Could you talk us through what impact you think this change would have on cases, hospitalisations, deaths, and you mentioned at the end of your comments about potentially changes to settings in future? Kelly: Our concern about the healthcare system in particular around the end of July, early August, at that time we had over 1,200 aged care facilities with outbreaks. Thousands of cases in aged care, hundreds of cases amongst healthcare [and] aged care workers. As of yesterday we have … just over 200 aged care outbreaks, less than 1,000 aged care residents with Covid, and 314 staff. Things have changed a lot since that time, and that’s included in a month where we decreased from seven days to five days, not in aged care but in the broader community. Aged care is a really helpful way of looking at and monitoring the situation going forward because of the close attention we are giving to that particularly vulnerable setting and will continue to do that. Your second question was? Q: Do you see a moment where you could recommend going back to mandatory isolation as a health recommendation? Your comments at the start seem to be emphasising … we’re in a low-risk setting, low community transmission setting. If we go back to a high-risk or high transmission setting, what would be your advice? Kelly: We have been tasked to come back with that advice. This comes back to the discussion about AHPPC (the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee) who have been very much involved with our charting-out of community protection framework for the next phase, a non-emergency phase of the pandemic response. And other parts of the government have looked at, the Health Department more broadly, had a transition approach. That would fit into that. We will … provide that advice in due course. Prime minister says decision was unanimous Q: Should we describe the decision today as unanimous by National Cabinet or is it better described as a consensus decision? Albanese: It was a unanimous decision by the national cabinet today and had the support of all premiers and chief ministers. Recommendation ‘does not in any way suggest that the pandemic is finished’: CMO Chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly follows Albanese: Yesterday the prime minister did ask me for some specific medical advice in relation to this proposal to remove the isolation period as it currently stands, so I provided him with that correspondence and that will be circulated as the prime minister has said. I would like to stress that this is a context-specific and timing-specific set of recommendations. It recognises that we are in a very low … community transmission phase of the pandemic here in Australia. It does not in any way suggest that the pandemic is finished. We will almost certainly see future peaks of the virus into the future, as we have seen earlier in this year. However, at the moment, we have very low rates of both cases, hospitalisations, intensive care admissions, aged care outbreaks and various other measures that we have been following very closely in our weekly open report. We also have, at the moment, very high hybrid immunity from previous infection[s], as well as high vaccination rates particularly and specifically in those highly vulnerable communities – older people, people in aged care in particular, people living with a disability and the ones that we have talked about many times before. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, began his address acknowledging the “devastating” impact of Hurricane Ian in Florida and to extend his deepest sympathies on behalf of Australia to all of those who have been affected in the Florida peninsula, the Cayman Islands and Cuba. As for the national cabinet meeting, he says it’s been “a very successful meeting”: We wanted to make sure that we have measures which are proportionate and that are targeted at the most vulnerable. We want to continue to promote vaccinations as being absolutely critical, including people getting booster shots. And we want a policy that promotes resilience and capacity-building and reduces a reliance on government intervention. We have agreed to that … states and territory also end their respective mandatory isolation requirements on 14 October. The pandemic leave disaster payments will end at that time as well, with the exception of people in high-risk settings, which need to be given particular support. So, aged care, healthcare, the measures, disability care, the areas that have been previously identified. Optus hacker concealed their identity, police confirm Just circling back to the Optus presser … Gough was asked if the attack was a sophisticated attack or a basic attack as the home affairs minister said: I am not going to go into the details of the cyber attack because it is the subject of our ongoing investigation, but the cyber criminal behind this hack has used obfuscation techniques to conceal their identity, but that is part of the ongoing investigation. The mandatory covid isolation period has been scrapped following the latest meeting of the national cabinet, which means there is no more stay at home orders if you are diagnosed with covid. The exception is for those working in health or aged care settings. But for everyone else, the five day isolation period is gone. Which raises questions about the sick leave payment – it was only in place while the isolation period was mandatory. For those who do not receive sick leave as part of their job, “doing the right thing” and staying at home when sick just got a lot harder. We’ll bring you more on that very soon. AFP expects Optus investigation to be ‘long and complex’ Justine Gough of the AFP says the investigation into who is responsible for the breach is continuing. We expected to be long and complex. Operation Hurricane is an AFP priority. You can be assured that our very clever and dedicated cyber investigators are focused on delivering justice for those whose personal information has been compromised. Gough is giving details about what the investigation involves: Monitoring online forums, the internet and the dark web for other criminals [who are] trying to exploit the personal information released online. Engaging with the financial services to detect criminal activity associated with the data breach. Analysing reports to determine whether there are links between individuals who have been exploited. And identifying and disrupting cyber criminals. The JCP3 will give collective legislative powers [and] experienced investigative and intelligence capabilities of all Australian policing jurisdictions [sic]. It will also complement other agencies including the Australian Cyber Security Centre. Optus is fully cooperating with the investigation and a number of other agencies are working with us to help protect Australians. Assistant commisisoner with the AFP Justine Gough has taken to the mic to discuss the Optus data breach. The initial investigation into who is responsible for the breach is continuing but a new operation known as ‘Operation Guardian’ will give priority to helping the 10,000 affected by the leaked data that was part of the ransom demand. Today I am announcing a further measure to help protect those individuals who are most at risk from cyber criminals. The AFP and state and territory police have set up ‘Operation Guardian’ to supercharge the protection of more than 10,000 customers whose notification credentials have been unlawfully released online after the Optus data breach. Customers affected by the breach will receive multijurisdictional and multilayered protection from identity crime and financial fraud. The 10,000 individuals who potentially had 100 points over the notification released online will be prioritised. Under the AFP lead policing cybercrime coordination centre, a joint partnership between law enforcement, the private sector and industry, to combat the growing threat of cybercrime, operation will focus on key measures to help shield affected customers, including identifying the 10,000 individuals across Australia now at risk of identity fraud and working with industry to enable further protection for those members of the public. Reports National Cabinet scraps Covid-19 isolation Guardian Australia is waiting to independently confirm this. A post-cabinet media conference is due to be held shortly. Matt Kean supports Natasha Maclaren-Jones’ nomination for Pittwater The New South Wales treasurer, Matt Kean, has thrown his support behind Natasha Maclaren-Jones for preselection in the seat of Pittwater after Rob Stokes announced he would not stand at the upcoming election. While she had not spoken with him about this before making public her intention to run, he said she would be a “great member for Pittwater’’. Speaking in Haymarket on Friday morning, Kean said: She’s certainly a strong candidate and I look forward to other strong candidates sticking up their hands to be part of our team. He said Stokes leaving would be a “huge loss” for the NSW Liberals. Rob Stokes has been a big champion to see more women coming into parliament and I look forward to Rob Stokes supporting a woman into the seat of Pittwater. Kean brushed aside suggestions there would be a lack of experience within the Liberal ranks at the upcoming election. We’ve got a new, young, dynamic Liberal premier, with a new, fresh team setting a bold, new vision for the state. There were 8,061 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and five people are in intensive care. AFP to speak about Optus breach shortly The Australian Federal Police are holding a press conference in 15 minutes about the massive Optus data breach. We’ll bring you more updates shortly. ACT revokes public health emergency declaration The ACT’s Public Health Emergency Declaration has been revoked after more than two and a half years. The ACT government has transitioned the Territory’s Covid-19 public health response to a Covid-19 management declaration and associated directions. Just an hour after the New South Wales infrastructure minister, Rob Stokes, announced he would not contest the March election, the families and communities minister, Natasha Maclaren-Jones, has announced she would put herself forward for preselection in the seat of Pittwater. If successful, the move would see her shift from the upper to lower house of state parliament. She said: Pittwater has always been very special to me having been a part of this wonderfully diverse community. It is from my love for Pittwater and my commitment to continuing to serve our community that today I announce I will be putting myself. She thanked Stokes for his longstanding service to the community and wished him well. In his statement, Stokes said it was time to “give others the opportunity to stand as Liberal candidate for Pittwater” in March: It’s time to make room for a different perspective and a new voice for Pittwater. We now need a contest to elect a new representative to serve the Pittwater community in the parliament of NSW. The Queensland government has scrapped its proposal for land tax increases for interstate landlords. Under the proposed changes, interstate property holdings would have been taken into account when determining whether an investor meets the threshold for land tax concessions. The Courier Mail reported that the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, made the decision on Thursday night after speaking to interstate leaders who have heavily opposed the proposal. It comes after a dogged campaign by the real estate industry that included what experts have described as “baseless” claims that rents would rise in Queensland due to the changes. The Queensland health minister Yvette D’Ath is addressing the media, responding to a report that investigated Mackay Base hospital’s obstetrics and gynaecology department today. D’Ath said: Of the 84 determinations, 26 cases fell below the expected standards. Of the 26 identified the women have been advised of a compensation pathway. D’Ath said the board at Mackay Base hospital would be given a show cause notice but that the investigation showed stronger clinical governance was needed across the state. She also said the government was launching a statewide safety and quality improvement program. eBay fined for NRL Grand Final scalping E-commerce giant eBay has been slapped with fines for alleged breaches of scalping laws after it listed tickets to Sunday’s sold-out NRL grand final on the platform, AAP reports. NSW Fair Trading said on Friday it had issued eBay with “multiple penalty infringement notices as a result of NRL grand final tickets appearing on the platform” in contravention of state ticket scalping laws. The fair trading commissioner, Natasha Mann, said officers from the agency attended eBay’s Sydney offices and issued the penalty notices for grand final tickets being advertised contrary to regulations. Under state laws, companies found breaching ticket reselling laws can be fined up to $110,000, while individuals can be fined up to $22,000. Mann said in a statement: To protect consumers, NSW laws require advertisements for the resale of tickets to specify the original cost of the ticket and a resale price that is no more than 10% above the original cost. NSW Fair Trading is actively monitoring other platforms where grand final tickets may be resold and will take similar actions where tickets are being sold contrary to NSW laws. She said the investigation into eBay was ongoing. Comment has been sought from the agency on how much eBay has been fined and the number of infringements, and eBay has also been contacted for comment. Sunday’s match between the Parramatta Eels and Penrith Panthers in Sydney is officially sold out after the last public allocation of tickets was snapped up on Tuesday. The crackdown on the tech giant comes after the consumer watchdog publicly warned about the risks of ticket scalping at major events such as grand final. Mann said: If you have seen advertisements in breach of the ticket scalping laws, please contact NSW Fair Trading. Government committing resources to ensure Safety in Sport hotline able to handle demand We brought you the news a little earlier about the federal government’s new Safety in Sport division, to be part of Sport Integrity Australia. The minister for sport, Anika Wells, said a key measure will be an expansion of SIA’s existing 1300 number hotline to allow for anonymous reporting of abuse in sport. If you were left a little confused about the announcement, so were we – is the hotline is newly taking abuse allegations, or is it that it’s new that they’re anonymous? Guardian Australia clarified with Wells’ office and understands the hotline previously existed in a “low-key way”, with many unaware of its existence. It was established two years ago with the government expecting 60 complaints a year, but instead received 600 each year. The government is now committing the resources to make sure the hotline is better able to handle the volume of complaints. Female Antarctic expeditioners forced to ‘go to great lengths to make their menstruation invisible,’ review finds The Australian Antarctic Division has commissioned an independent review of its HR practises and complaint systems after a damning report found widespread evidence of sexism and sexual harassment at remote science stations, including unwanted physical contact, displays of pornography, and limited provision for women menstruating. The ABC earlier first broke the story of the report by associate prof Meredith Nash, an AAD senior advisor and University of Tasmania researcher. The report found evidence of gender inequality and inappropriate behaviour at Australian stations in Antarctica, including reports of sexist jokes, inappropriate drinking culture, uninvited physical contact or gestures, unwelcome requests for sex, displays of offensive or pornographic material, and a homophobic culture on stations. The report made particular note of female expeditioners in the program being forced to “go to great lengths to make their menstruation invisible”, including “attempts to practically conceal menstruation in Antarctica in environments where the infrastructure for them to do so was absent or inadequate.” Reports included women being forced to change menstrual products without privacy or adequate sanitation, including carrying used products in the field with them, improvising menstrual products when no fresh supplies are available, and keeping products in their bodies for longer than recommended due to inadequate toilet stops. The report recommended widespread action to address gender inequality, including more regular surveys about station culture, diversifying application pools to attract a wider variety of staff, and major reforms to internal culture such as providing free menstrual products, better health training, training around sexual harassment and complaints, and “a major outreach effort to address sexual harassment”. The secretary of the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, David Fredericks, said in a statement that the report’s findings were unacceptable. He said the department was already working to implement Nash’s recommendations, including developing action plans, training and policy to improve culture. Fredericks noted that the AAD’s senior executives had been all men just 12 months ago, but that now 50% of station leaders were women. He noted updates had already been made to recruitment, manuals, and leadership training. The department has also commissioned its own independent review of actions already taken, and what is left to do. That report will be delivered by 12 December. Dutton: Australias should be ‘white-hot with anger’ over Optus data breach Opposition leader Peter Dutton has criticised the government for not introducing new privacy legislation to parliament following the Optus data breach, AAP reports. Dutton said Australians should be “white-hot with anger” after their sensitive information was stolen by hackers. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, earlier this week said the government is seeking to put legislation to the lower house by the end of this year. But this was slammed as being too slow by the Coalition. Dutton told Nine today: It should have been in the parliament this week, the government was aware of this problem. I think 10 million Australians should be white-hot with anger that their information was compromised, and the home affairs minister went missing for three days. The telco is also being pressured to cover the cost of replacement passports and other documents stolen in the data breach last week. The opposition has called for the government to unfreeze “critical” cyber security funding, which is being reviewed along with other industry grants given by the former Morrison government. More than $60m in cyber security training grants have been withheld. The opposition industry spokesperson, Sussan Ley, said delaying funding from the Cyber Security Skills Partnership Innovation Fund was inexcusable. Labor have already been forced to retract unfounded political attacks on other initiatives which supported some of our most critical sectors to boost sovereign capability – and now his failure to support our cyber security industry has left our country weaker. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, labelled the breach a “wake-up call” for the corporate sector. Showers in NSW to ease Monday Here is the statement from NSW minister for infrastructure, Rob Stokes, who has announced he will retire from politics ahead of next year’s March election. I’ve had a great go, and now is the time to give others the opportunity to stand as Liberal candidate for Pittwater at the election next year. I am immensely grateful to the people of Pittwater and the Liberal party for the amazing privilege I have had to serve our community as an elected representative for more than 15 years. I’m now excited to support someone else to have that chance. It’s time to make room for a different perspective and a new voice for Pittwater. We now need a contest to elect a new representative to serve the Pittwater community in the parliament of New South Wales. In the meantime, I will use all my energy, experience and enthusiasm to support the Liberals and Nationals team as we fight to return the Perrottet-Toole Government in 2023. What an honour it has been to serve as part of a government that has fought to transform New South Wales into a freer, fairer and more prosperous society. Public service is a team effort. I am thankful to my family, friends and everyone I’ve worked with for their support on an amazing journey representing Pittwater in parliament. Stokes served as the member for Pittwater for 16 years and confirmed he will not nominate for pre-election in his Northern Beaches seat. Push to scrap Covid-19 isolation puts public at risk, peak medical body says We brought you the news a little earlier from AMA President Steve Robson that the true waiting times for elective surgery in the public system are often three or four times longer than what is publicly reported because the wait times for specialist appointments aren’t being accounted for. Robson was on ABC News Breakfast discussing that new report, and was also asked by the team about the National Cabinet Meeting today, which could consider scrapping Covid-19 isolation periods entirely. I think people who are pushing for the isolation periods to be cut are not scientifically literate and putting the public at risk and need to understand that. What would the consequences if National Cabinet did remove that period today? We’re seeing overseas a huge upswing in the numbers of Covid cases again. It’s coming into holiday season when people will be travelling around the world. We think it’s a period of significant risk and we’re urging caution because we need to protect the health system and we need to protect vulnerable people like those in aged care and people with a disability. Robson was asked about the argument put forward by NSW premier Dominic Perrottet and others that there is no other mandatory isolation period for other illnesses, where it becomes people’s personal responsibility to stay home if sick. Why is that not a valid argument? If you think the flu is Covid, you’re living in fantasy land. Covid is a long-term infectious, we’re already seeing a massive effect of long Covid on the workforce and the community. You don’t have it with long flu or long cold. It’s fantasy. Environment minister shocked by report into culture and harassment at Australia’s science stations in Antarctica We’re reading through the damning report into culture and harassment at Australia’s science stations in Antarctica, but environment minister Tanya Plibersek – the government member with responsibility over Antarctica – said more change is needed to urgently fix the issues identified. In a statement, Plibersek said she was “shocked and disappointed” at the report’s findings, stressing the government’s commitment to implementing the Respect At Work improvements in all settings. Plibersek’s statement is below and we’ll bring you more from that report shortly: I was recently informed about a report, conducted by Prof Meredith Nash, into culture and behaviour at the Australian Antarctic Division. Professor Nash spoke to staff who have experienced sexual harassment, exclusion and marginalisation, particularly while stationed in Antarctica. When I was briefed on this for the first time, and when I read people’s stories, I was shocked and I was disappointed. Let me be absolutely clear: there is no place for sexual harassment or inappropriate behaviour in any workplace. Just this week the government introduced the Respect at Work legislation. This legislation backs in our commitment to safe and respectful workplaces, everywhere. The Australian Antarctic Division is no exception. Our remote stations in Antarctica are no exception. I take this report incredibly seriously. The treatment outlined in the report was, and is, unacceptable. The department is working through the recommendations of the report. I know that cultural change has already begun at the Australian Antarctic Division. I want to thank everyone who has been part of this. More change is needed. The work the division does is critical: for our national interest, for science and the environment, for the future of this planet. It’s far too important to be tainted and diminished by prejudice and harassment. There were 9,458 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and nine people are in intensive care. There were 12,592 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and 24 people are in intensive care. NSW government loses another minister from politics Rob Stokes, the current NSW infrastructure minister, will announce this morning that he is leaving politics. The former Macquarie University lecturer in planning was twice NSW’s planning minister and has lately been the state’s infrastructure and active transport minister. Stokes was well-regarded by his fellow MPs and knew his planning portfolio better than most of his department staffers. He was also a firm supporter of environmental issues (and was environment minister for a stint), and for taking action on climate change – not always easy positions to hold within a Coalition government. Stokes joins an exodus of senior MPs from the government who won’t be standing at next March’s elections, potentially making it harder for Dominic Perrottet to hold on to office. Tasmania supports scrapping isolation but will be guided by health advice, premier says The premier of Tasmania, Jeremy Rockliff, together with the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, is pushing to end the mandatory Covid isolation period ahead of the national cabinet meeting today. This is what Rockliff told the ABC in Canberra: I said we support that in principle, but in Tasmania we have always taken the best of public health advice including national advice, of course, and look forward to the discussions today. But in principle, as was the in-principle support of the reduction from seven days to five days, I think it’s a natural progression. In Tasmania, we have always been guided by the best of public health advice and so we will consider the advice that’s presented to us and the discussions that we have with public health officials and they’ll be very informative. Rockliff said it was also important to consider people’s mental health as well as business and workforce issues. However, he also said: Health is always been, right throughout the pandemic, the No 1 priority. Gale force winds warning for the Gold Coast Russian oligarch with stake in Queensland Alumina Limited charged by US Department of Justice Overnight, the US Department of Justice charged the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska with the evasion of sanctions against him, including by using shell companies to hide his assets in America and through an elaborate scheme where he is alleged to have tried to bring his pregnant girlfriend into the country to give birth. Deripaska is probably best known in Australia for owning a minority stake in Queensland Alumina Limited – the remainder belongs to Rio Tinto, which runs the refinery. The EN+ group, founded by Deripaska, owns 20% of QAL. Deripaska’s effective interest is less because he reduced his shareholding of EN+ to 45% after the US slapped sanctions on him in 2018. Deripaska wasn’t initially among the oligarchs sanctioned by the Australian government following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but they caught up with him a few days later. Rio took full control of the refinery in response to the sanctions – a move that EN+ group subsidiary Rusal is now suing it over. Scrapping Covid-19 isolation is ‘natural step’, Perrottet says The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, says he is confident that Covid-19 isolation will be scrapped at the national cabinet meeting today. Perrottet: We will have some health briefings today … the old days of having a situation where different states are doing different things … it’s better for consistency and national harmony [for] everyone to move together. It has been over 900 days [from] where we have had this public-health orders in place, and I think this is the natural step. We made significant inroads as a country, we have a consistently balanced public health with broader health issues, mental health and particularly young kids … and we have to balance that with the financial and economic impacts of these public health orders. But ultimately we also need to get to this position where people look out for each other, that we care for each other, and that we make sure if we’re sick we stay at home without there being a public health order in place. There are many factors you have to take into consideration. In our state over the last two years we have balanced the public health advice with the broader health advice and economic impacts that come with that as well … making the decision that is in the best interest of the country, and I’m pretty sure we have that today. Victoria waiting more than 900 days for urgent neurosurgery appointments Here are some of the key statistics from the Australian Medical Association report out today: In Victoria, a patient will wait more than 900 days for an urgent neurosurgery appointment (target 30 days). In Queensland, a patient will wait more than 150 days for an urgent gastroenterology or rheumatology appointment (target 30 days). For non-urgent appointments (target 365 days) in Queensland and Victoria, most specialities are not meeting the target. Waiting times for ophthalmology, orthopaedic, and plastic/reconstructive appointments are all more than 700 days in both states. The average waiting time in Tasmania was 101.2 days for urgent patients (target 30 days). When it comes to wait times for specialist appointments, we know Australians living outside capital cities can be some of the worst affected: Australia’s “hidden waiting list” for specialist appointments adds months and sometimes years to the time patients wait for essential surgery, the Australian Medical Association says. AMA’s president, Prof Steve Robson, is today launching a new report, titled Shining a Light on the Hidden Waiting List, which highlights the unreported time it takes patients to see a specialist in public hospitals. Robson said: These hidden figures are a scandal that affect hundreds and thousands of patients and impact a health system already in logjam, including general practice that has to deal with the pressure of looking after many of these patients in the meantime. There are no reliable data on the time it takes a patient to see a specialist in a public hospital outpatient clinic after seeing their general practitioner, but we know it can be years. Elective surgery waiting times are reported nationally each year, but these numbers don’t reflect the time someone waits to see the specialist in an outpatient clinic. How can any system properly operate or be properly managed if we don’t know how many patients are waiting for care? Patients, many of them in pain, aren’t just waiting years for surgery. Sometimes they are waiting years just to see a specialist who can get them on the official surgery waiting list. During this wait, they often develop other health issues, such as mental health issues and diabetes, which further affects their quality of life and ends up costing the system more. It’s like counting emergency waiting room times without counting the hours someone is waiting in an ambulance to get into the waiting room. The only way we can fix our hospital system is by having total transparency on the number of people who are waiting for care – this means counting people from the time the general practitioner refers them to a specialist. How can we possibly know how many doctors, nurses and beds we need if we have inconsistent and unreliable data? We’ve been calling for years for public hospital waiting times to be published. Robson said while the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare was working with jurisdictions to include outpatient waiting data, a national plan was needed now to address the backlog. We need a plan, and we need immediate action to take pressure off our hospitals that are in crisis — including 50-50 funding and removal of the 6.5% cap. Car fire on M1 Motorway outside Newcastle No changes to aged care Covid-19 settings, regardless of national cabinet decisions The ABC Radio interview with Anika Wells turns from sport to her other portfolio – aged care. Wells is asked about the upcoming national cabinet meeting’s potential changes to Covid policy settings. She said the rules for nursing homes will remain the same regardless of the decisions by state leaders. The Australian defence force support in aged care homes is also ending, and Wells confirmed she does believe it is the right thing to do. She said the program was never intended to be in place as long as it was. The minister for sport, Anika Wells, is speaking to ABC Radio about an announcement to expand the government’s scope to help people in sport report racism, abuse and mistreatement. It comes after a range of high-profile cases in elite sport, including the damaging review into Hawthorn Football Club which contained allegations of serious mistreatment of First Nations former players, as well as the Australian Human Rights Commission’s report into the culture of gymnastics, the findings in Swimming Australia’s review of the treatment of female swimmers and the Do Better report. Wells said the federal government is announcing a new Safety in Sport division to be part of Sport Integrity Australia, which will be “world-leading.” She said the division will include a broad focus on cultural and intersectional issues under the National Integrity Framework, which will be culturally informed and trauma-led. Another key measure will be an expansion of an existing 1300 number hotline to allow for anonymous reporting of abuse in sport. Wells said the hotline will be expanded to a toll-free triage, referral and reporting service “so that truth-telling is fostered”. ‘Action will be taken’: Husic on Antarctic sexual harassment allegations Ed Husic, the minister for industry and science, was asked by ABC Radio whether the government will be investigating allegations of bullying, homophobia and sexual harassment for Australians sent to work in Antarctica detailed in a report (see previous post). Husic said: It absolutely is concerning ... it’s shocking and certainly action will be taken. Antarctic expeditioners complain of ‘predatory’, widespread sexual harassment Allegations of widespread sexual harassment at Australia’s Antarctic research stations have emerged from an external review of the culture commissioned by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD). The ABC’s Henry Belot reports that: Australians sent to work in Antarctica have complained about a widespread and predatory culture of sexual harassment with unwelcome requests for sex, taunting, displays of offensive pornography and homophobia. Prof Meredith Nash, who is an associate dean at the Australian National University and wrote the report completed earlier this year, told the ABC that women “have to work in the field with their abusers for weeks at a time because they simply can’t leave”. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek has responded to the report saying its findings are unacceptable: Sexual harassment is unacceptable in any workplace anywhere. I was actually gobsmacked to read some of the reports here talking about, you know, pornographic images upon walls. Like, you know ... I really did think we had eradicated this sort of thing from Australian workplaces decades ago. It’s not acceptable. The report made 42 recommendations on how to change the culture at the stations, including the creation of an “equity and inclusion taskforce”. All recommendations will be accepted by the division. Industry minister ‘very’ concerned gas will never get back to $10 a gigajoule Tony Wood, an energy expert from the Grattan Institute, said he doesn’t think gas will ever get back down to $10 a gigajoule, and that could lead to some manufacturers closing. Asked if he agrees, Husic said: I’m very concerned about that. Gas producers need to work for public interest, not against it, industry minister says Is the government still allowing multinational gas companies to continue making profits while domestic manufacturers struggle to keep going? Husic: The gas producers have to recognise they have a role to play in meeting the national interest not working against it. There is room there to supply and there is definitely room there to supply at prices – for an Australian resource – that meets the needs of Australian manufacturers and households. Why isn’t there a price trigger? Husic: Because this work needs to continue, the biggest priority was to ensure we had supply ... so that’s happened. We’re trying to ensure we boost local self-sufficiency, we address supply chain shortages and we can ensure we aren’t just dependent on one or two markets for all our products ... the gas producers have a very important role to play in meeting that national interest. Gas prices need to come down for manufacturers and households, industry minister says The minister for industry and science, Ed Husic, is speaking to ABC Radio after the government yesterday struck a deal with gas companies to keep more Australian energy at home. Is it good enough that the deal won’t bring the cost down to what it was before the war in Ukraine? The additional supply is really important, the ACCC flagged there would be a shortfall if that did come about you would see what that would do to prices and it wouldn’t be pretty ... The other thing is there is a protection in place to make sure the prices don’t go above export prices ... the next part of this job is to ensure prices come down for manufacturers and households. Private rental market ‘the epicentre’ of Australia’s housing affordability problem, report finds A $1.6bn agreement to help facilitate affordable housing in Australia has failed to reduce inequity and national reform is now imperative, the Productivity Commission has found. The commission on Friday released the findings of its review into the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement (NHHA), the key document that governs federal funding to the states for housing services. The sharply worded report urges the government to overhaul commonwealth rent assistance, focus on fixing the rental crisis, and wind back concessions and grants for homebuyers in favour of funding stretched homelessness services. State and territory leaders will meet in-person in Canberra on Friday, with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to convene the latest national cabinet meeting. Covid health briefings will again be high on the agenda, with discussion expected around public health settings for the virus. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, has long called for mandatory Covid isolation periods to be scrapped. Recent national cabinet meetings have rebuffed those calls, but after the last meeting in mid-September, Albanese said Friday’s meeting would “have a discussion about future arrangement ... what we are seeing is gradually a move towards Covid being treated like other health issues”. That last meeting also locked in an agreement for the pandemic leave disaster payment, to support those isolating without sick leave, to remain available for as long as mandatory isolation periods are applied. Friday’s meeting will also discuss the budget positions of the commonwealth and state governments, as well as receive a briefing from the Bureau of Meteorology and the National Emergency Management Australia (Nema) body on the coming La Niña weather season. Leaders will consider scrapping Covid-19 isolation rules when they meet as part of national cabinet today. The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, is pushing to scrap mandatory isolation entirely, after the last national cabinet meeting saw the isolation period reduced from seven to five days. The state and territory leaders will also be briefed by the new emergency management agency on the threat of storms and flooding as the country heads into its third La Niña summer. This week the government released its highly anticipated national integrity commission legislation, but one of the details that has come under the fire is how often hearings will be public. Crossbenchers have raised concerns the “exceptional circumstances” threshold for public hearings is too high but the government says closed hearings would be the default. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said he doesn’t want public hearings to become “show trials” and believes the government has the balance right. However, the shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, Dan Tehan, isn’t convinced. Playing on its acronym, NACC, Tehan expressed concern the integrity commission “will become a knackery” in a tweet sharing the Australian columnist Henry Ergas’s article drawing comparisons with the Salem witch trials. To give a flavour of the article, Ergas begins with saying “what was new about the Salem witch trials was that they were held in public”. It concludes that “no self-respecting Australian government ought to permit a form of lynch justice” but that had “the Greens and the teals … been at Salem, they would have been rushing forward with the matches.” Let’s get going!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/mar/27/australia-politics-live-john-howard-moira-deeming-anthony-albanese-chris-minns-new-south-wales-election-peter-dutton-safeguard-mechanism-greens-adam-bandt-vic-qld","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T07:47:26Z","webTitle":"Dutton stays silent in question time – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/27/australia-politics-live-john-howard-moira-deeming-anthony-albanese-chris-minns-new-south-wales-election-peter-dutton-safeguard-mechanism-greens-adam-bandt-vic-qld","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/27/australia-politics-live-john-howard-moira-deeming-anthony-albanese-chris-minns-new-south-wales-election-peter-dutton-safeguard-mechanism-greens-adam-bandt-vic-qld","fields":{"headline":"Dutton stays silent in question time – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re going to wrap up the live blog now. Here’s what made the news today: The Albanese government’s signature climate bill targeting big polluters is a step closer to passing after a deal was struck with the Greens, including an absolute cap on emissions. The former Greens leader, Bob Brown, said Labor’s rejection of the Greens’ push for no new coal and gas as part of those negotiations was “a colossal mistake”. The Victorian Liberal leader, John Pesutto, buckled to pressure and withdrawn his bid to expel controversial MP Moira Deeming from the party room. Whistleblower Richard Boyle will face a trial and potential prison term after judge Liesl Kudelka found his actions were not immune to prosecution under the Public Interest Disclosure Act. There’s been more fallout from the NSW election. The cost-of-living crisis in western Sydney and a loss of trust in government drove voters in the region away from the Coalition, experts say. Australian sport is facing a “$2bn black hole” in investment over the next decade that sets the nation up for failure at upcoming major international events, according to Matt Carroll, CEO of the Australian Olympic Committee. Amy Remeikis will be back with you early tomorrow morning. Until then, have a great evening. ‘Extraordinary stuff’: Labor MP claims Deeming contradicted Pessuto in tweet The Labor MP Josh Burns is highlighting a tweet from Moira Deeming that appears to contradict the Victorian Liberal leader, John Pessuto’s statements about her earlier today. Pessuto buckled to pressure earlier today and withdrew his bid to expel Deeming from the party room. Instead, after a two-hour meeting, the Liberal party room on Monday unanimously voted to suspend the upper house MP for nine months, as well as strip her of the position of upper house whip after she belatedly condemned anti-transgender activists. Pessuto said he had proposed the new outcome after receiving “important concessions” from Deeming at 6.30am on Monday that included a condemnation of comments made by Kellie-Jay Keen and the rally’s organiser, Angie Jones: Whilst it took a few days, Moira actually provided the condemnation I’d been seeking all along and that provided an opportunity during today’s meeting for me to propose a slightly different outcome. Pesutto said Deeming “specifically” condemned comments made by Keen and Jones that were contained in a 15-page dossier sent by the Liberal leadership to MPs last week. On Twitter a short time ago, Deeming said she never condemned Keen and Jones. Study to probe how electric vehicle drivers recharge Hundreds of electric car owners are being sought for a study looking into whether Australia’s electricity grid will be able to charge millions of the next-generation vehicles by 2030. The research, by the University of Queensland, will also test whether new electric vehicle owners can be tempted to change their charging behaviour to use solar power and what incentives would encourage them to do so, AAP reports. The findings will add to data collected in a 2021 study that found three in four electric vehicle drivers were already charging their cars outside peak demand times. Chief investigator Andrea La Nauze said the research team hoped to survey 400 Australian Tesla owners for the latest stage of the study. Even though tens of thousands of electric vehicles were already being used in Australia, Dr La Nauze said little was known about when and where owners were powering their cars: We’re interested in charging behaviour, what determines charging behaviour and what consumers really want to shift their charging behaviour. We want to know how responsive they are to incentives and do they like pricing programs that encourage them to charge at different times of the day. - AAP Analysis: Labor-Greens deal on safeguard mechanism gives each party a win Chief political correspondent Paul Karp has just filed analysis on the government’s signature climate bill and what’s likely to happen in coming months. The Labor-Greens deal on the safeguard mechanism won’t put a stop to new coal and gas projects, but it will put a hard enough brake that we’ll hear the screech if any get the government’s go-ahead. For weeks the climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has been locked in negotiations determined to pass the signature climate bill without taking up the minor party’s “offer not ultimatum” of no new coal and gas. Through rounds of interviews urging them to help reduce emissions, Bowen has ruled out a ban, a pause and a climate trigger in environmental approval laws. But behind the scenes, the Greens were fashioning demands they say amount to the next best thing. On Monday the deal was revealed. At its heart is a cap on participants’ emissions of 1,233m tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030 or about 140m tonnes a year. Expect to hear these lines all the way to the election: “we tried to stop new coal and gas and they wouldn’t let us” from the Greens; “Labor has caved to the Greens, hobbled our industries and hurt households” from the Coalition. In the meantime, a deal is a win for the government, which somehow continues to find a way on climate change despite sky-high demands. Read the full piece here: QLD minister supports calls for state ban on Nazi salutes We’re set for another big sitting week in Queensland parliament with anti-hate crime legislation to be introduced and a housing roundtable kicking off tomorrow. On Monday, it was the transport minister, Mark Bailey’s turn to field questions from the media ahead of a Labor caucus meeting. Bailey said the banning of Nazi salutes was a matter for the attorney-general but expressed his strong personal support for such a move: I have zero time and very open hostility to fascism and Nazism and extremism ... There is no place for fascist or Nazi symbolism. I would support any ban on the Nazi salute. The Victorian government confirmed it would seek to ban public displays of the Nazi salute after “disgusting” scenes at an anti-trans protest. So far the Queensland government has steered clear of explicitly confirming whether they would follow suit. A spokesperson for Queensland’s attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, told Guardian Australia the legislation “will introduce a circumstance of aggravation for a range of offences, including public nuisance, where the offence is motivated by hatred or prejudice”. This will mean that a court is able to impose more severe penalties for these offences. Whether the new laws will apply to certain behaviours or situations will depend on the specific circumstances in each case. It comes after Fentiman confirmed the Queensland government would move to ban Nazi tattoos as part of a hate symbol framework it has dubbed “among the strongest in the country”. Some Sydney nurses to strike tomorrow morning The NSW premier-designate, Chris Minns, has barely put his feet under the desk, but strike action is already looming in the state. NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association members will hold a one-hour stop work meeting from 7am at Mater Private Hospital in North Sydney and ban requests for overtime for a 24-hour period. Union members at St Vincent’s Private will also ban requests for overtime. The union’s assistant general secretary, Michael Whaites, said he wanted to highlight the frustration private sector nurses and midwives have reported about staff shortages. According to a statement by the union, nightshift staffing levels will be maintained in all wards and units. Property market showing signs of stability, small uptick It wasn’t that long ago that people were predicting steep dives of 20% or more in property prices, with higher interest rates to be the main driver. Lately, the real estate market has been showing signs of stability, if not a bit of an uptick. That’s despite 10 consecutive rate rises by the Reserve Bank, and the prospect of one or two more to come. According to CoreLogic’s preliminary numbers, auction clearances over the past week were 71%, or the highest since mid-April last year. It’s worth highlighting that auction totals remain well down on a year ago, but if vendors see a higher proportion of auctions succeeded, we will likely see more of them willing to sell. Prices, it seems, have stopped falling too - after losing about 9% from their peaks. It’s mixed news, of course. Those owning a home want to see its value retained. Those desperate to escape from rising rents, however, would rather see those prices fall further. And RBA board members want to see more proof higher borrowing costs are sapping excessive demand before they opt to pause rate hikes. March, it seems, won’t provide much evidence on that front, at least. Liberal MP calls for ban on gambling ads Just circling back to Russell Broadbent’s appearance on ABC Afternoon Briefing. After declaring an interest in racehorses, Broadbent supported calls for a ban or heavy restrictions on gambling ads. I can’t stand the advertisements. Are we not mature enough a nation to listen to what Zoe Daniel is saying and get those ads off the television? Especially ‘bet with your mate’. The underlying [message] is you are not really a mate unless you bet with me. Malcolm Turnbull criticises ‘right wing angertainment complex’ Helpful as always, Australia’s 29th prime minister has his say on the message the NSW election result sent to the Liberals. The former federal MP Trent Zimmerman, a moderate, said the NSW election result should provide “some deep soul searching in Liberal ranks”: One of the debates already under way is whether this new national picture reflects a common theme or if there are factors unique to each state that makes a national narrative more difficult to ascertain. It’s an important question and will determine some of the learnings for the Liberal party. You can read his full piece here: Labor signals spending to avoid 30 June budget cliffs The Albanese government has hinted it will spend billions to avoid going off the edge of funding cliffs in the budget, with arts institutions, e-safety, My Health Record and even the radioactive waste agency otherwise slated for cuts. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and finance minister, Katy Gallagher, have released details of agencies and programs they say the Coalition failed to budget for, with many set to run out of funds from 30 June. The move is the strongest signal yet that arts and collecting institutions, including the National Library’s Trove database will see funding restored in the May budget. It follows $4.1bn of additional spending in the October budget to avoid so-called budget cliffs. According to Chalmers and Gallagher, the My Health Record and public health dental schemes were due to receive no funds from 1 July, leaving 23 million people without access to health records and 180,000 without subsidised dental services. The Australian Radioactive Waste Agency was to receive no funding from mid-December 2023. The National Emergency Management Agency and the eSafety Commissioner were both due to have “significant” reductions in funding from 1 July. Labor made the funding cliffs a significant focus in question time on Monday, with dorothy dixers to the communications minister, Michelle Rowland and arts minister, Tony Burke. Burke told the lower house that additional funding is due to run out on 30 June for the maritime museum, portrait gallery, national museum, the national film and sound archive, the national gallery, and old parliament house. He said: Part of telling the Australian story isn’t just the institutions themselves but it’s about digitising that story and keeping it through the process of trove and many members on this side and across the crossbench have contacted me for some time about Trove. Trove is one of the Australian government’s most visited online services. More than 50,000 visits a day. Over 1,500 digitised newspaper titles. 900 partner organisations. But under their proposal, it would be funded until, guess what date? 30 June. And at 30 June, the money for the National Library to be able to continue funding Trove was all going to finish. Australia’s wine industry fizzing over prosecco Taking a very quick break from politics to talk about something else most of us love – prosecco. Australian winemakers are being urged to have their say on the European Union’s proposal to claim the naming rights for key products including prosecco, AAP reports. A final round of major negotiations with the bloc will take place in Brussels next month, as delegations work to seal a free trade deal by a mid-year deadline. One of the biggest sticking points is Australia’s unwillingness to give ground over geographical indicators on locally made produce such as prosecco and feta. The government is running a public objections consultation process on wine GIs put forward by the EU. Lee McLean, head of Australian Grape &amp; Wine, said prosecco growers first went into battle in 2013 to protect the Australian industry which is now worth $200m. Here’s what McLean told AAP: We will certainly be voicing our grievances about the EU’s push to protect prosecco as a geographical indicator. Prosecco is a grape variety, just like shiraz is, just like chardonnay is. We need to make sure that Australian producers maintain that right to use the grape variety name on their labels. Deeming resolution ‘a missed opportunity’, Thwaites says The Labor MP Kate Thwaites, also a Victorian, has a very different take on the Moira Deeming development to Russell Broadbent. She’s told the ABC the Victorian Liberals should have taken a much stronger stance. I think it’s a missed opportunity. John Pesutto tried to take a stand and show that the Victorian Liberals don’t stand for hate and they don’t stand for division and his party room has rolled him. I think that is really unfortunate message. I had parents in my electorate who have transgender children contact me and say those children have found the past weeks very difficult. Liberal MP says Deeming backdown ‘a big win’ for the party The Liberal MP Russell Broadbent, who represents the Victorian seat of Monash, has told the ABC the state party reached the right outcome regarding controversial MP Moira Deeming. Earlier today, the Victorian Liberal leader, John Pesutto, buckled to pressure and withdrawn his bid Deeming from the party room. Pesutto had initially sought to move a motion to expel Deeming from the parliamentary Liberal party, after she attended a rally headlined by the British anti-transgender activist Kellie-Jay Keen last weekend that was also attended by neo-Nazis, who were photographed performing the Nazi salute. Here’s Broadbent’s take on ABC Afternoon Briefing: From my point of view, the Liberal party had a big win in this because whatever position each one took after the event that weekend, they have been able to come to a place where, after a couple of hours of solid discussion with one another, come to a place that is acceptable to everybody. I’m not saying which way I would have gone in any given instance, I’m a great supporter of women’s rights and women’s issues and women who want to stay at home and look after the children we don’t give that enough emphasising. There’s a big push from the crossbench to limit or ban gambling ads this week. Rebekha Sharkie, Andrew Wilkie and Zoe Daniel have all drafted legislation and the issues is the subject of an ongoing parliamentary inquiry. Today the government released a new study that found 38% of the adult population gambled at least weekly. Three in four Australians gambled at least once during the past 12 months and, of those, almost half (46%) were classified as being at some risk of harm from wagering. Zoe Daniel has told ABC Afternoon Briefing that gambling ads should be restricted, they should be banned. I know the studies released suggest time restrictions, I say ban ads on television. I think the same argument was made about alcohol and the same argument was made about tobacco. We managed to navigate our way through both of those bans for the public good. As far as broadcast advertising, the numbers are pretty extraordinary with hundreds of thousands of broadcast gambling ads over the year, almost 1,000 ads a day. Senator Tyrrell signals support for safeguard mechanism deal The Jacqui Lambie Network senator Tammy Tyrrell is also doing the media rounds this afternoon and has signalled support for the safeguard mechanism deal, although she’d like to see more of the detail. Here’s what she just told the ABC: Look, we haven’t seen a lot of the detail around what the Greens have put up. We have seen some of the media and [the Greens] have done some beautiful speeches on it, but standby, we’re OK with it. Tyrell, whose vote along with Jacqui Lambie’s could be crucial in the senate, has again campaigned for Tasmanian industry to be supported. We want industry in Tasmania and in Australia. If you can carve out some safety and security, we’re happy. China trip an ‘opportunity to engage’, Ayres says Tim Ayres has also flagged an upcoming visit to China from his senior minister, Don Farrell. He didn’t directly answer a question whether his upcoming visit to China was “a downpayment by the regime to clear the way” for future visits. It is just an opportunity to engage. I see it like that. There’s certainly been an invitation extended to minister Farrell. I expect that visit will happen in due course. We are carefully and methodically working through these issues in the national interest. We always put the national interest at the centre of the representations that we make. Government has made ‘steady progress’ with China, senator says The assistant minister for trade, Tim Ayres, is also on ABC Afternoon Briefing talking about his upcoming visit to China for a business forum. It’s another sign of thawing diplomatic relations between Canberra and Beijing, but Senator Ayres says don’t get too carried away: It’s important not to overstate or understate the progress that has been made to date. There has been progress over a select range of commodities. These are trade impediments that never should have been in place in the first place and we are working in a careful and methodical way. If given the opportunity, I will be making the case about all of the range of projects that have impediments in front of them. There will be business leaders from some of those sectors who are engaging themselves as well and we support the work that they are doing. As you said, there has been steady progress over the term of the government as we work to stabilise a relationship with China. The parliament continues to be a messy beast and Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst have eyes on that for you, to let you know where the cards fall (or indeed where they will fall) so make sure you check back. I will hand you over to the lovely Henry Belot now to take you through the rest of the day’s news. I will be back very early tomorrow morning. But a very big thank you to those who came along with us through a huge day– hope you get a bit of a break tonight and please, as always – take care of you. Greens have stopped half of future oil and gas projects with deal, Bandt says Speaking to ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, Adam Bandt says the Greens have secured a win when it comes to the safeguard mechanism: We have for the first time put a cap on actual pollution which puts a limit on how much coal and gas can expand in Australia and it will be in law. When we started these discussions with Labor when they put the scheme on the table, pollution from coal and gas would keep going up. It was going to increase substantially as they opened lots of new coal and gas projects. With a new project in the pipeline, we managed to stop emissions equivalent to about half of them, managed to stop about half the projects going ahead and that is because there will be a cap in law that the big polluters cannot offset their way out of. Meanwhile, the government is staying fairly quiet about its housing fund, because, well, it is quite far from where it would like to be in terms of gaining support. Just reviewing question time, I probably should have pointed this out – Peter Dutton was unusually silent. As in, didn’t even ask a question silent. The Aston byelection is this weekend. And quite possibly closer than it seems if Dutton is staying silent in QT. He also didn’t attend the safeguard mechanism press conference – that was held by Ted O’Brien by himself. Quite possibly the only two happy people in the parliament today (as captured by Mike Bowers) I missed this earlier today in *gestures to all of it* but there has been some condemnation of the anti-trans rights agitators from the Liberal party. Stuart Robert was making a personal explanation in the chamber when the chamber started getting rowdy. Sussan Ley has walked across the chamber to where Sam Rae was and began yelling at him. It was loud enough that Milton Dick had to stop proceedings and ask for people to sit down. Sam Rae denies saying ‘at least I have my own children’ in chamber The LNP MP Angie Bell has written to the speaker, Milton Dick, alleging that while she was giving a speech, the Labor MP for Hawke, Sam Rae, “yelled the phrase” ‘at least I have my own children’. Bell asks the speaker about it: Earlier today in the chamber, the members for Hawke interjected with statements about my own family life which is was unacceptable especially post the Jenkins report and I wrote to you regarding this incident. I accept that the member has stood up and apologised for something that was an interjection. But I placed on the record that it was not an interjection. It was a slur on my family. And I think it should be outlined. Rae had already addressed this before Bell stood up, denying he made those comments: I’ve received comments from the media and in the chamber concerning an interjection I made during debate earlier today during a speech by the Honourable Member for Moncrieff, the comments of my alleged objection was of a personal nature against the member. This is absolutely not correct. I accept interjections are always disorderly and apologise to the member for being disruptive during her speech. My comments made absolutely no reference to the member herself. The comments that have been attributed by some to me were not made by me and would never be made by me. And question time ends. Question on voice to parliament and RBA decisions Julian Leeser is back – and has a question which is very similar to a question a reporter asked Anthony Albanese in a press conference earlier today. The proposed voice to parliament will have a constitutional function of making representations of the executive government on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Reserve Bank of Australia is part of the executive government and interest rates affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as they do all Australians. Will the Reserve Bank need to consult with the voice before making a decision on interest rates? (The question in the press conference was whether the voice would have to consult on things like the safeguard mechanism). Linda Burney is very, very short with her answer (in tone and length) The last time I checked, the RBA was independent. Anthony Albanese continues: The shadow attorney general has been involved in a deeper way in this process for longer than I have been. That is why he knows full well, he knows full well that some of the campaign that has attempted to draw questions where they simply are not there are disingenuous going forward. Noel Pearson [referred to] the shadow attorney general in his article in the Australian of a few weeks ago. ‘I said to the shadow attorney general that he was right than, he should, he should have the courage to stand up for the principal position that he has historically taken on this issue and support, yes, when it is put to the Australian people went this year’. The shadow attorney general knows because it was outlined historically how this process occurred in that article by Noel Pearson just a couple of weeks ago in the Weekend Australian. To the credit of the weekend Australian they got it right and I say to the member to take it on that. ‘The government does not release cabinet papers,’ Albanese says The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, has the next question: Labor governments have routinely released solicitor general advice when convenient to do so on at least three occasions. Why won’t the government relay that advice to the voice department. Why only when its politically convenient to do so? Anthony Albanese: The government does not release cabinet papers, nor did the gvernment that he sat in the nine years release cabinet documents, not once. Not once. I must about, I assume this is talking about the voice to parliament although the question didn’t refer to that. The fact is that I would encourage the shadow attorney general to continue to engage with the government because one of the things that he knows, because he helped to write some of the words. He helped to write some of the words that are now going to be put before the Australian people. When he was a part of a process more than a decade ago. What the shadow attorney general knows, others may not but he knows full well is how disingenuous some of the comments have been made. Because the shadow attorney general ... Dan Tehan wants Albanese to answer the question. Which he did. At the beginning. When he said “the government does not release cabinet papers, nor did the government that he sat in the nine years, release cabinet papers”. Question on wiping student debt The Greens MP for Brisbane, Stephen Bates, asks: Student help debt hangs over entire generations adding more financial stress to people already struggling through the cost-of-living crisis. If the government can afford the $254bn stage three tax cuts and to spend $268bn on nuclear submarines, why can’t we afford to wipe student debt? Jim Chalmers: We understand that students and young Australians are under pressure at a time when we’ve got inflation which is higher than we would like and will hang around for longer than we’d like. Our job is to try and strike the right balance between the most responsible budget possible and doing what we can to ease the pressures on people. We’ve got a system, as the honourable member knows, and all honourable members here know, where people repay their student debt when they reach a certain income level. They pay a portion of their university costs. We think that that is a good system, because it means that people don’t start to repay that debt until they’re beginning to earn, you know, what is approaching a decent wage. Obviously we are aware of, in the last few weeks there have been stories about the pressures on former students in particular – reports about students and former students under pressure, and we take that very seriously. When it comes to the broader pressures on the budget, we’ve been up-front about those as well and we need to manage those carefully in the context of high inflation, which is impacting disproportionately, including on the people he asks the question on behalf of. One of the other things, Mr Speaker, which is really important is to make sure that we are building more social and affordable housing for people and that’s why it is so disappointing, Mr Speaker, that when the Greens in this place were given the opportunity to vote for more social and affordable housing, they scurried for the door. They ran for the door. That was disappointing, Mr Speaker, because you would have thought for a party that talks so much about younger people, a party that talks so much about affordable housing, the least they could have done is to support the minister’s efforts so we can get the supply and build more homes and begin to take some of the pressure of people. It was disappointing. On the specifics of the question, I think I have answered that about pressures on students and former students in particular. The least of the Greens could do is when the government puts forward a sensible, important policy to make life a bit is here for those people, the less they can do is vote for it. Interim NSW Labor cabinet to be sworn in tomorrow An interim New South Wales Labor cabinet will be sworn in tomorrow, as counting continues following the weekend election. The state’s incoming treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, announced on Monday that Labor would form an interim ministry made up of members of the party’s senior leadership tomorrow. Incoming ministers have held informal meetings with the public service today, but Mookhey said the formal swearing in would allow it to begin receiving formal briefs. The senior leadership team is made up of the incoming premier, Chris Minns, and senior ministers-designate including the deputy leader, Prue Car (education), Penny Sharpe (environment), Ryan Park (health), Jo Haylen (transport), John Graham (special minister for state), and Mookhey. Mookhey said: Tomorrow there will be a Labor government formed in NSW constitutionally. It will allow us to have access to the public service and to get the briefings by departments. It will formally bring an end to the caretaker conventions is the other point here, which will allow decision making to resume in NSW. With vote counting still under way and a handful of seats undecided, Mookhey said the rest of the ministry is likely to be sworn in next week. He said the government’s immediate priorities included receiving briefs on the status of flood relief measures in the state’s north, as well as on a recent fish kill in the Menindee lakes. Question on cashless debit card The Coalition’s Michael Sukkar has the next question: Prime minister, since the government abolished the cashless debit card the consequences have been devastating with police records showing an almost doubling of offences in Ceduna alone. Prime minister, in the gallery today, there are representatives from the northern Goldfields who are here to speak to parliamentarians about the devastating effects the government’s abolition of the cashless debit card is having on their communities. When will the prime minister reverse his decision to abolish the cashless debit card? Anthony Albanese: The minister will be meeting with the delegation who are here today and I understand from a media release from the member opposite that he has raised them meeting here and of course people should have the opportunity before this parliament to engage. It’s something that my government does. We’re respectful of people, we listen to people, and we went to the election with a clear commitment ... (Sukkar is interjecting and gets warned) We also understand that on so many of the issues that have been raised – for example, in the Northern Territory, where there hasn’t been a change – there is substantial misinformation about the impact which has occurred here. The truth is that in so many of these communities what we’re dealing with is intergenerational disadvantage. That is a failure – a failure – of all governments. Of all governments across the board. Now, the minister might like to, or the shadow minister might like to think that everything was all OK beforehand, but the truth is that when you sit down and talk with communities, as I have around the country ... they will inform you – they will inform you that these issues of intergenerational disadvantage, intergenerational unemployment, despair, is something that has brought certainly myself to the view that we need to try and do things better in the future. That’s what my government is committed to do. That’s what my government is committed to do and I’d encourage those opposite, and in particular the member opposite, to engage in a constructive way with the government to achieve solutions and move forward in their interests. ‘No customer should bear the cost of a data breach’: government on cybersecurity The cyber security minister, Clare O’Neil, has released a statement on the Latitude hack (this is the fourth or fifth data hack my details have been caught up with. FUN) Here is part of it: On 16 March the Federal Government convened the National Coordination Mechanism (NCM) to bring together agencies across the Commonwealth, states and territories to ensure that all possible support is being provided to Latitude Financial and all those customers whose personal information has been stolen. The NCM has met five times in relation to the Latitude incident, and we have established two NCM working groups to address specific issues relating to the Financial Sector, and Identity Security and Services. Latitude Financial is cooperating with government in responding to this incident, and we expect the company to continue to swiftly provide the government with all information it needs. It remains our position that no customer should bear the cost of a data breach and we are working with Latitude Financial to ensure that the customers affected by this attack are protected from immediate and future risks. More on budget ‘legacy issues’ 'Tony Burke is next on the “legacy issues” train when it comes to dixers. (Paul Karp tells me Peter Dutton is waving to kids in the gallery while this goes on.) Burke: Additional funding – additional funding – runs out for the Maritime Museum on 30 June, for the Portrait Gallery on 30 June, for the National Museum on 30 June ... funding for the National Film and Sound Archive on 30 June, for the National Gallery of Australia on 30 June, and for Old Parliament House the additional money runs out on 30 June. Now, those opposite have already started interjecting about what a wonderful job they did with respect to the arts and cultural institutions ... So wonderful there’s actually a motion on the notice paper at the moment from the member for Lyons saying that their arts funding reached 55 million Australians. So with those sorts of numbers they’ve got quite a story to tell! Part of telling the Australian story isn’t just the institutions themselves but it’s about digitising that story and keeping it through the process of trove and many members on this side and across the crossbench have contacted me for some time about Trove. Trove is one of the Australian government’s most visited online services. More than 50,000 visits a day. Over 1,500 digitised newspaper titles, 900 partner organisations. But under their proposal, it would be funded until, guess what date? 30 June. And at 30 June, the money for the National Library to be able to continue funding Trove was all going to finish. It is across all the collecting institutions. I don’t know if they thought maybe at the National Gallery you hold the roof up with blue poles or maybe it would be like Night At The Museum and all of the exhibits would start running around and fixing the building themselves every night. But under their funding the workers don’t have a future who work there and under their funding the buildings are allowed to leak and collapse. This is the legacy, this is the legacy. And they laugh about – the leader of the National Party laughing about the concept of a building leak. Think of the value of what’s held in the National Gallery. Think of the concept of being custodians of the national story and think about a budget where everything finished on 30 June. PM on Aukus and defence Anthony Albanese answers that question with: Anthony Albanese: The first question on Aukus I got from anyone on the other side. This is a very significant announcement and we put up over a period of decades the fact that the cost would be between $268bn and $368bn. Under that arrangement Australia would be responsible at the end of life, when the nuclear fuel cell is completed we will be responsible for the storage of that and we have said it will be on defence land. We also, I can confirm that there is no responsibility to store anyone else’s waste. It’s a responsibility to store what effectively will be our own, because what the plan is here is for us to build these submarines in Adelaide and for once the Australian flag is on a submarine, like once the Australian flag is on a plane or any other piece of equipment, it is our responsibility and we are in control. That is a part of our national sovereignty member opposite would agree is important. But the issue on the economy is also important, to say this. Unless – unless – our national security is looked after, then the impact on our economy, on our society, on everything else, falls away, and that is why expenditure and investment in our national sovereignty is so important, is so absolutely vital. I don’t apologise for making a commitment that will see our defence expenditure rise over future years. The truth is, we live in an era of strategic competition in our region. The truth is, we live in very uncertain times and it is important that we invest in our capability. It’s also important that we invest in our relationships and my government is doing both. We are investing in our capability, whether it be nuclear-powered submarines, or whether it be other military equipment that will improve our capability. Next month, we’ll be releasing the defence strategic review that will outline the work of Sir Angus Houston and Stephen Smith, but that is an important priority for us going forward. We make no apologies for that. But at the same time we’re also building positive and constructive relationships to advance peace, security and stability in our region. Question on Aukus costs and nuclear waste Dai Le, the independent MP for Fowler, wants to know: The government committed to spending $368bn on acquiring nuclear-powered submarines when people are struggling to pay the grocery bills. We still don’t know the full cost to taxpayers and where and how the nuclear waste will be stored. What will it cost our taxpayers to manage this nuclear waste and will Australia be accepting any nuclear waste from other Aukus [members] under the agreement? Question on regional funding Kevin Hogan, the Nationals MP for Page, asks Catherine King: I refer the minister to the government’s failure last week in parliament to address the regional programs to for local councils and given it has been 10 months since the federal election and five months since the budget, how many grants to local councils and community groups have been formally assessed and approved from Labor’s regional and community programs announced in the budget? The infrastructure minister says: We inherited an absolute mess when it came to regional grants. And if you remember, we got elected on a promise to clean up the rorts and pork-barrelling that categorise the regional grants program. When we came into government we had the building better regions fund, which was because the to substantial Australian national office report which found there were significant flaws in the way in which the previous government made decisions. When we came to office, we found that not a single one of around six building better regions fund had been assessed at all. So concerned were all of you about all of those programs and so concerned you are asked specifically about it … Paul Fletcher has a point of order on relevance and Milton Dick asks King to get to the question: Again because we are talking about the reason that when we came to government, we have had to clean up the appalling job that those opposite particularly the National party did when it came to regional grants programs. I don’t make any apologies about us taking some time to actually build integrity into the regional grants program. Because we had under the community development grants program billions and billions of dollars frankly pork-barrel into National party and Liberal party seats across this country. We are taking our time with the growing regions program, the guidelines are currently before all of the stakeholders to look at ensuring that they are being used with the best possible processes we can and the announcement about the of those applications will be done shortly. Again I remind the house, the reason we have had to do this to take our time is because of the terrible job, the terrible job those opposite did when it came to regional grants programs. Frankly, when it comes to things like the community development grants, like the building better regions fund, you have no integrity when it came to the distribution of those grants and I’m looking forward to having a program that puts in place an important program to fund our regions, to fund our regions properly, fairly and transparently, something does opposite were incapable of doing and it means absolutely it shows why not a single one of them should ever occupy these benches ever again when it comes to integrity and grants. Chalmers on holes in Coalition’s budget As part of this dixer, Jim Chalmers is going through the measures which had not been funded by the Coalition for this budget, despite having made announcements: For example, the former government jumped up and said they were going to fund [inaudible] of the Olympics in south-east Queensland, they budgeted precisely $0 for that task. Those opposite had the My Health Record system that is used by millions of Australians to store personal health information, not funded beyond the middle of this year. There is a safety commissioner that is responsible for keeping our kids safe online, not funded, the Australian radioactive waste agency in charge of disposing radioactive materials – not funded. MyGov is not funded in an ongoing way. This is the way those opposite went about vandalising the budget. They were notorious for making the big announcements but not funding them in the budget. The leader of the Opposition cannot distance themselves from the behaviour, he was a member of the committee that made these decisions. He sits over there hoping if he doesn’t ask any questions the voters of Aston won’t notice and won’t remember who the member of the Liberal Party is in Canberra. “Pressures on the budget and pressures on the economy” – the subtitle of Jim Chalmers’ new book “$1 trillion of inherited Liberal party debt”. Chalmers is running through the chapter “booby traps in the budget” in this dixer. (In case I need to make it clear, there is no book, but given the amount of words Chalmers has spoken on this topic since coming to government, there could be several volumes). Same cost of living question, different answer? Sussan Ley just pointed out in a point of order that the Coalition has asked the question about the cost of living “hundreds of times” and never gets an answer. To be fair, it gets different versions of the same answer every time. Adding in this tag-line- “Will this out-of-touch prime minister finally admit that families always pay more under Labor?” allows Anthony Albanese to talk about whatever he likes. Meanwhile, we are the ones who suffer. Crossbench question on infrastructure investment Allegra Spender has one of the crossbench questions and the independent Wentworth MP wants to know from Anthony Albanese: In 2014 you told this house that independent cost benefit analysis of infrastructure proposals was necessary to ‘Ensure there is proper value for taxpayers from infrastructure investment and that we get the right infrastructure investment to boost productivity’. Does the prime minister still hold this view and if not why not? Albanese: Indeed I am very proud that we established Infrastructure Australia was one of the first pieces of legislation, the first week of the new Labor government when parliament first sat in 2008 after 2007 election. But that it is bring together a board, serious board made up of private sector representatives as well as representatives from state and local government. To make sure there was productivity at analysis so the funding and investment from the Commonwealth went to the right projects. That was a board that contained the former Kennett government minister in Victoria, who was the deputy chair. We had people like Kerry Schott and serious people doing proper analysis through the process. What that led to was projects being funded – every single one of the priority projects being funded. Upon coming to office, we now have legislation before this parliament to amend Infrastructure Australia to make sure it goes back to where it should be. Indeed ... I mean, with respect, having a former, you know, deputy mayor of a council where the minister happened to come from was ... somewhat compared with Sir Rod Eddington, was just an undermining of that process and it was not taken seriously. The legislation that is before the parliament moved by the infrastructure minister will make sure that there’s transparency, will make sure that there’s proper analysis, because there is a finite level of resources, and that is why we should make sure that productivity drives that agenda going forward. That is what my government has committed to and that is what we will get on with the business of doing and I look forward to the parliament supporting the legislation moved by the minister. The former Greens leader, Bob Brown, has some thoughts on the deal on the safeguard mechanism: The Greens have fought for no new coal and gas and Albanese rejected that outright. It is a colossal mistake. Instead, the Greens will get a hard cap on emissions which stops half the proposed 100+ future coal and gas projects going ahead. Their strong stand for no new coal or gas will be vindicated as the impact of rising temperatures, worse storms, coral bleaching, drought and sea-level rises wreak havoc on every Australian’s wellbeing. Minister Bowen flagging today that he may ‘amend the rules to amend the cap’ is flagging Labor treachery. If he does that he will bring the house down. Australians, not least Labor voters, will want him to have the integrity to stand by the hard cap agreement and if he reneges he will be selling out to profit the coal and gas billionaires at the planet’s expense. Australian sport is facing a “$2bn black hole” in investment over the next decade that sets the nation up for failure at upcoming major international events, according to Matt Carroll, CEO of the Australian Olympic Committee. Carroll used an address to the National Press Club in Canberra today to call for more federal funding over the course of the next 10 years, citing a “continued and significant decline” in strategic government investment that has set sport on a path to “fall over a financial cliff”. Carroll said the AOC analysis showed a huge shortfall in the 10 years leading up to the 2032 Brisbane Olympics and Paralympics, and 2026 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, placing ambitions for the events on home soil under threat. The shortfall consists of half a billion for participation and $1.5bn for high performance, spread over the 10 years,” Carroll said. “That’s not nearly enough to retain the current levels of sports performance, let alone to maximise the Brisbane 2032 opportunities. Without investment, what governments in Australia want sport to achieve for the community is not going to happen and, in all honesty, and openness, unless this situation is rectified, Australia will be staring failure in the face at the 2026 Commonwealth Games and the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games because our home teams will have been undermined by inaction. Carroll proposed a package of measures to address the issue, including a new partnership between sport and the government, a stand-alone federal department of sport and a national “statement of purpose” that clearly identifies where sport sits as a national priority. Question on power bills …. yet again There is another question about a Coalition constituent who is seeing their power bill go up and broken promises on the cost of living. Anthony Albanese gives his 6,785th version of this answer: One of the reasons why the member of the Goldstein is here, one of the reasons why she is here is because of her position which she went to the election on, supporting action on climate change. Like the other crossbenchers up there. And for those opposite, even after Saturday, to not have some sort of bellringer. some sort of wake-up call after the Victorian state election, where Daniel Andrews increased his majority, increased his majority, I’m not sure what it takes for them to realise that the future and people want action for the future. Those opposite, those opposite can be stuck in the past but we will continue to move forward, continue to move forward along with, as part of global action, as part of international action that we need to be a part of. Those opposite are just so stuck in the past and the problem isn’t that they are frozen in time as the world warms around them, the problem is they want everyone to stay back there and keep them company. To stay back there and keep them company. Those on the side of the house will not do that. Will not do that. We will continue to engage in a constructive way, a constructive way to get things done in this parliament. And what amazes me is that those opposite are actually having opportunity to participate in debate. It they instead choose to be observers, they don’t participate in all at any of the processes that are better before the Senate or any of the processes here, they just come in here and vote no, no, no, to everything. That is why they gets upset when I say about the Noalition. If they are so upset about that than better stop acting like it. Albanese refers to ‘Greens political party’ In a dixer on the safeguard mechanism, Anthony Albanese referred to the “Greens political party” which made Adam Bandt crack a smile. Paul Karp, who is in the chamber, heard a Coalition MP yell out “you’re in charge, Adam”. Which seems to be giving the game away – because given the senate numbers, if the Coalition says no, then Labor has to go to the Greens to get the numbers it needs. ‘A sad day for the LGBTIQ+ community, Jewish community’: Victoria Labor A statement has just landed from Victoria’s minister for equality, Harriet Shing: This is a sad day for the LGBTIQ+ community, Jewish community and all Victorians who oppose bigotry and hatred. The fact the debate was held in what is supposed to be a mainstream political party is a disgrace – the fact it was lost is abhorrent. It’s only one week ago that John Pesutto said this was a “necessary step” to ensure the Liberal Party was an “effective opposition” and “ready to govern” come the 2026 state election. The Andrews’ Labor government is getting on with doing what matters for all Victorians – and ensuring that in our state, equality is not negotiable. OK question time begins, and it begins in the same way it has for the last week – will Anthony Albanese take responsibility for the cost of living crisis and Albanese talking about how it started under the Coalition and somehow time is still allegedly moving forward. Just before question time starts, a little more from Melbourne: John Pesutto denies he’s made a compromise in allowing Deeming to stay in the party. He also denies that he jumped the gun in calling for her to be expelled: I wanted to send a strong message that this kind of behaviour – Nazi references, or whatever else it might be – has no place in the Victoria I want to lead with my colleagues in 2026. So it was absolutely necessary to bring the notice of motion ... I didn’t need any further convincing about the urgency of the matter. I will not tolerate it. That’s why I brought the motion when I was satisfied on Sunday that there will be no concessions forthcoming. He again reiterates it’s not a freedom of speech issue. Says Deeming is entitled to her views on trans rights as long as she “understand[s] and appreciate[s] the sensitivities of the debate”: There is a discussion going on around the world. And I’m not here today to go into a debate about those issues. International sports federations are grappling with this. Schools are grappling with this. It’s a very sensitive and complex discussion. NSW Liberals scramble to lock down replacement leader The outgoing New South Wales attorney general, Mark Speakman, has indicated a possible tilt at becoming the state’s new opposition leader. After the outgoing premier, Dominic Perrottet’s announcement that he would step down as party leader following Saturday’s election loss, Liberal figures are scrambling to lock down a replacement to take over. Right-faction figures Alister Henskens and Anthony Roberts are understood to be considering a run for the job, but the moderates – the dominant faction in NSW – have been left without an obvious pick after the outgoing treasurer, Matt Kean, ruled himself out. Speakman, a senior minister in the Perrottet and Berejiklian governments and the MP for Cronulla, is now seen as the most likely pick from the party’s left. On Monday afternoon he released a statement indicating he was considering a run. He said: I’m looking forward to discussions with my colleagues to ensure that we have a strong, refreshed &amp; energised team ready to hold the government accountable in the interests of the people of NSW. I’ll have more to say shortly. The party is still coming to terms with Saturday’s loss, and many senior party figures were scrutineering votes on polling booths as counting resumed on Monday morning. As the count continued, the Liberals received a boost on Monday with the ABC predicting it would hang onto the seat of Willoughby, previously held by the former premier Gladys Berejiklian. The incumbent, Tim James, received a serious scare from the independent Larissa Penn. Question time looms There is now 10 minutes until question time. What. A. Day. The opposition seems very energised by the safeguard mechanism deal, and just as intent on ignoring the fact it dealt itself out of negotiations at the very beginning to try and shape it to its liking, so expect questions on that and on the $275 (by 2025) power bill promise. Meanwhile, being the last week of sitting before the budget, expect the government dixers to begin highlighting all the issues within the budget it inherited from the Coalition. All things considered – you could go save yourself now and disengage for an hour or so. Go on without me. ‘You’ve got to take people on their face value’: Caulfield MP on Deeming Back in Melbourne and the Caulfield MP, David Southwick – who is Jewish – is asked how he feels that Deeming will remain in the party after attending a rally attended by neo-Nazis: Well, I wanted to firstly say that John has shown leadership today. John is showing that he’s prepared to listen. And he’s prepared to take somebody at face value that they’ve made a mistake. And they’ve admitted to that mistake, and they’re prepared to learn and work with the team. There is no question that what we’re seeing over the last week or so, for all communities, certainly from my community has been very hurtful. And that was certainly part of the discussion. But I think largely, you’ve got to take people on their face value ... For me, a real part of anything is actually getting people to admit their wrongs and to give them an opportunity to make them right. And I think that’s what it is. We need to give that opportunity for Moira to make it right. Let’s see what nine months bring. But it’s a big decision. It’s a decision that we haven’t taken lightly. John has shown true leadership that he’s listened and he’s given his colleagues the benefit of the doubt. O’Brien likens safeguard mechanism to carbon tax Ted O’Brien is giving the Labor party wayyyyyyy too much credit here. And also, just ahead of you reading this, the safeguard mechanism is not a carbon tax in any way, shape or form. O’Brien: You see, Labor has done what Labor is very good at and it has been their cunning plan, they’ve picked up something the Coalition created, the safeguard mechanism, and turned it on its head completely changing it. And they used it as a Trojan horse for a carbon tax. So this looks nothing like what the Coalition introduced years ago. I wouldn’t be surprised if O’Brien tried to rip the mask off the safeguard mechanism Scooby Doo-style down the track. Bob Katter voted against the safeguard mechanism, along with the opposition and independent Dai Le, on the grounds it was a “venomous attack” on the coal industry. Now you want to cold bloodedly go and destroy the jobs of 200,000 people,. And I sure would like some of our so-called trade union leaders to stand up here because, it seems to me I’m one of the very few that’s standing up. It’s alright for everybody here, with a nice warm job and their $250,000 a year.” I think from the votes that the Liberal MP Bridget Archer abstained. Last week she said she couldn’t vote for the bill in its current form, but she wouldn’t be voting against it either. ‘We should never dehumanise one another’: Pesutto A reporter has asked the Victorian Liberal leader, John Pesutto, what happens if one of his MPs attends an anti-trans rally next week. Here’s his reply: What I encourage all people no matter what political viewpoints, I’ve said this many times, ‘When you engage in debates particularly on important social and personal issues, we should never dehumanise one another.’ When I talk about being civil and respectful, you need to respect and appreciate the common bond of humanity we all share. And that means no matter what events you go to, if you see violence against other people, that’s never justified. If you see vilification, that dehumanises others – call it out, no matter what side of the debate you might be on. And those are my road marks for anybody engaging in public debate and entering the public square The independent MP Allegra Spender on the safeguard mechanism: This deal looks like it will significantly strengthen the safeguard mechanism. It’s a hugely positive step towards net zero and reflects strong collaboration between the government, crossbench, and Greens. The deal includes many of the changes that I and other crossbench members have been advocating – including a hard cap on emissions and restraint on the use of offsets. We also see strong action on new entrants, prioritising the future of Australian industry over polluting fossil fuels. We were elected to deliver on climate action. Today’s announcement shows that this parliament is doing that. Coalition on safeguard mechanism deal The shadow minister for energy, Ted O’Brien is holding a press conference criticising the government for dealing with the Greens on the safeguard mechanism, a piece of legislation the opposition said no to at the starting block, dealing itself out of the negotiations. O’Brien is now complaining about the outcome of these negotiations. Pesutto: I know we’re in politics and we look at these things through a political lens, but there’s a human element and the human element is that you want people to learn and to grow. And sure, I would have preferred. In fact, but I demanded ... she did that on Sunday but she’s done it and now she has an opportunity to work on it. Pesutto says Deeming has nine months to “prove herself”: I’m giving her the chance. And what I’d ask is we all give her the chance over the next nine months to prove herself. She’s got a great opportunity to do that. I thought and still considered that it was the sensible, reasonable and fair thing to do. Having seen her condemn it this morning, albeit many days too late, But nevertheless she’s condemned it. Opposition leader John Pesutto says Deeming accepts there must be consequences for her actions: Everything I said last week I can proudly stand by because she condemned the conduct which prompted the motion I brought, she’s accepted there must be serious consequences for not having done that earlier. And she accepts as a consequence losing the whip’s position as well, what we want. Remember, we want people to learn from these experiences. He denies he didn’t bring an expulsion motion forward because he lacked the numbers in the party room: I always felt confident that I had the numbers. What about Deeming’s anti-trans rights view? So Moira Deeming condemned the material in the dossier at 6.30am ahead of the meeting, but so far the condemnation stays private. And apparently that is all that John Pesutto wanted. So she is now suspended from the Liberal party for nine months. What about her anti-trans rights views? What she’s accepted is that our discussions around this must always be respectful and inclusive, even if people disagree. Remember, we live in a democracy and the main thing is to make sure that when people are engaged in public discourse, they do it in a courteous and civil way they can disagree. ‘That’s what I wanted all along,’ Pesutto says We are not allowed to see the concessions though. John Pesutto says that Moira Deeming has “specifically” condemned the anti-trans rights agitator Kellie-Jay Keen and a tweet in the dossier which was put together by Pesutto when he first announced the expulsion which is “what I wanted all along”. So Moira condemned the references to the Nazi material that you saw in the Kellie-Jay Keen references in the dossier, and also the Angie Jones tweet. So you’ve seen that from the dossier and for me, that’s what I wanted all along. I wanted it to be condemned, and she’s done that. John Pesutto says he had sought the concessions from Moira Deeming last weekend. She did not provide it until this morning, but Pesutto says it contained the condemnation he had been after. And because of that, Pesutto put forward the suspension proposal: What I can say is that the proposal I put to the party room was met with unanimous support. So out of this whole exercise, which began last weekend, we have a situation where the conduct I’d wanted condemned has been condemned, where there is a consequence that follows from not having condemned that when the first opportunity arose, and certainly when my colleagues and I sought a remark, and we’ve got a party room was unanimously behind the outcome. So we’re very pleased with that. Deeming ‘called out Nazism’ in meeting, Liberal leader says The Victorian Liberal leader, John Pesutto, has opened his press conference by saying that the Victorian Liberal party is inclusive. No matter your sexual preference, no matter what their race or ethnicity, political views, and we will listen and engage with people right across the board. That’s the Liberal party I want to lead, and today marks a turning point where we are on the road to achieving that in the lead up to the 2026 [election]. But he says that after receiving the information he had been seeking from Moira Deeming, he “proposed” a new outcome. Today, we had an extended, very lengthy and very emotional party room meeting that went for a very long time, and many members spoke and were very emotional during the course of that meeting, which took place off the back of some new information that was provided by Moira Deeming early this morning at around 6.30am. I’m advised that new information contained important concessions, and those concessions were in the form of a condemnation of the types of conduct that were referred to in the dossier in which I had always sought from the very start, and which had in fact, been what prompted the notice of motion in the first place. So whilst it took a few days, Moira actually provided the condemnation. I basically provided an opportunity during today’s meeting for me to propose a slightly different outcome given what Moira had provided I’ve been seeking and recognised why it was important to do that. And having heard from Moira along with other speakers herself, where she amongst other things, and I won’t go into all of the detail, but certainly called out Nazism and also called out any kind of bigotry against the LGBTI community. So in light of that I proposed an outcome. That outcome sees Moira be suspended from the parliamentary party for a period of nine months. She will lose the whip’s position and important position in the upper house. We are just waiting on the Victorian Liberal leader, John Pesutto’s press conference to begin. It’s meant to start in the next few minutes, but that means nothing on days like today. It is almost Senate time! Traditional owners hope safeguard deal will end fracking in Beetaloo Basin The Nurrdalinji Native Title Aboriginal Corporation, which represents traditional owners with native title interests across the Beetaloo Basin, is hopeful the amendments will put an end to the fracking of the region Traditional owner and Nurrdalinji chair Johnny Wilson said in a statement: Our country is in the hands of these big gas companies and I feel very grateful that we may one day not have to fight to protect our land, sacred sites, culture and water. No one has seen the jobs and economic benefits which have long been promised by the fracking companies, and we do not believe they will ever come. We want to live peacefully on our country and keep it safe for our children and grandchildren. The future lies with power from the sun, not drilling into my grandparents’ country and damaging water and everything that relies on it. Reaction to the safeguard deal is starting to roll in: The House is still working through amendments to the safeguard mechanism. Again, the government is only supporting those it has already agreed to in negotiations. Amendments moved by the teal independents have been voted down. Hundreds march after Indigenous man fatally shot by Queensland police Hundreds of people are marching in the north Queensland city of Mareeba after a local Indigenous man, Aubrey Donahue, was shot and killed by police on Saturday. Donahue’s family claim the 28-year-old was unarmed, carrying a phone and attempting to surrender to police when he was shot on Saturday afternoon. He had earlier been threatening self-harm. Police initially released a statement claiming Donahue advanced on officers while holding a knife. But since Saturday, police have refused to make any further comment or address family claims that he was unarmed, saying it would be “inappropriate” to do so. At a public meeting on Sunday, a senior police officer said those “questions” were a matter for the coroner. Donahue’s brother was arrested by police immediately after the shooting and released from custody on Monday, during the protest. He raised his fist as he left the watch house. Morning recap So to catch you up on the morning: The Greens and Labor have struck a deal on the safeguard mechanism, which will see a hard cap of 140 megatonnes of pollution built into the legislation. Victorian upper house MP Moira Deeming has escaped expulsion from the Liberal party and instead will receive a nine-month suspension. Former US president Barrack Obama is in town and has done some sort of Singin’ in the Rain revival with Anthony Albanese in Sydney. Moira Deeming has avoided being expelled from the parliamentary Liberal party after a marathon two-hour meeting of MPs, instead receiving a nine-month suspension. Guardian Australia understands opposition leader John Pesutto’s expulsion motion did not go to a vote in the special party room meeting held at parliament on Monday morning. Pesutto sought to expel Deeming after she attended a rally headlined by British anti-transgender activist Kellie-Jay Keen where neo-Nazis were photographed performing the Nazi salute last weekend. Deeming has denied wrongdoing. The vote had been considered an early test for Pesutto, who took over the leadership following November’s election loss vowing to bring the party back to the centre. On this account it’s clear he has failed, after earlier vowing to make no compromise. Expect the division between the party room’s socially liberal and conservative members to continue. Deeming left the meeting without commenting. She was flanked by her supporters. Pesutto left with leadership team and called presser for 1.15pm. It seems there is a little bit of confusion among the Coalition on what they are meant to be opposing in these amendments. An amendment to the safeguard mechanism just passed without division (Kylea Tink tried to put in an amendment, that it seemed one Coalition MP almost accidentally supported) but the government opposed it, so the amendment went down. On the second reading, it seems only Ted O’Brien, Angus Taylor and Paul Fletcher were confident enough to call for a division (usually all those who oppose say nay to force the division, but there is a little bit of hesitancy in the chamber today). Or maybe it is just recovery from the weekend’s election result. Over in the chamber, and debate has resumed on the safeguard mechanism bill. Amendments are being moved – the only ones the government will support are ones they have already agreed to in negotiations. Back in Melbourne: PM hopes parliament gives ‘unanimous support’ to Indigenous voice Back to the prime minister – this is what Anthony Albanese had to say on whether or not he thinks the Liberal party will land on “no” under Peter Dutton for the voice referendum: I seek bipartisanship here. This is about two things and two things only. Not about, you know – it does reflect on our international relationships, but it’s about two things. It’s about recognising First Nations people in our constitution and then it’s about that they’ll be consulted on matters that affect them. That’s what it is about. Nothing more but nothing less. And the Australian people will be given the opportunity to have a say towards the end of this year. And I sincerely hope that the Australian people support “yes” and I hope that it is – receives the unanimous support of this parliament, but that’s something that I can only be open, which I have been. You know, part of the debate that I have had an engagement with people in this room has been, “Why aren’t you more prescriptive?” The reason why we weren’t more prescriptive is to give people the space to come onboard, to make a suggestion, to say: “Well, if this happens, we’ll be more supportive.” We changed our position on the pamphlet going out. Why did we do that? Because we wanted to show that we were prepared to do something even though I, personally, if it was up to me, just me, it’s not a preferred position. It’s not about imposing my will. It’s about providing support. I was one of the least important people up here last Thursday. You know, it’s about these people who have fought their whole life for just a bit of recognition in our constitution and justice and to be listened to. Not because they want to engage, because they want to make a difference. It’s about practical outcomes. We know that outcomes will be better when people are consulted. Latitude Financial has disclosed that details of 14 million consumer records – including driver’s licences, passport numbers and financial statements – were stolen from its system in a cyber hack that is far worse than the company initially reported. The consumer lender, which offers personal loans and credit to customers shopping at stores including JB Hi-Fi, The Good Guys and Harvey Norman, said in a statement on Monday that some of the documents date back to at least 2005. Latitude chief executive Ahmed Fahour said: It is hugely disappointing that such a significant number of additional customers and applicants have been affected by this incident. We apologise unreservedly. We are committed to working closely with impacted customers and applicants to minimise the risk and disruption to them, including reimbursing the cost if they choose to replace their ID document. Latitude first disclosed it was hacked in mid-March, although the breach was thought to only include about 100,000 identification documents and 225,000 customer records. The company detected unusual activity on its systems but not before the attacker obtained Latitude employee log-in credentials to access the documentation. The breach is the latest in a series of major attacks on Australian companies, following hacks at Optus and Medibank, among others. PM on Dutton’s stance on voice It seems Anthony Albanese is feeling a little bullish this morning. Q: Prime minister, we talk a lot about desire to get bipartisanship and you have even talked about giving Mr Dutton space to arrive at a position. Albanese: Sure. Q: Wouldn’t soliciting the solicitor general’s advice be a small price to pay for getting the Coalition onboard? Albanese: Are you telling me it’s your view? I know it’s – we’ll do a two-way here. Are you telling me it’s your view if we release that advice, then they’ll change their position? Q: Well, I’m asking: wouldn’t it? Albanese: I’m asking if you were me, if you were me, would you think that there is any sign that in any of the times in which Peter Dutton has been asked a question about the voice to parliament that have been any sign other than that he is not – well, any sign other than that he is undermining a support for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people? I’m awaiting it. I have had seven meetings with him. He’s met with the referendum working group. There are no signs, and he was a member of a government that did not release any cabinet papers or advice to the cabinet in the nine years in which he was a member of the cabinet. Seems like there is some movement in the Victorian Liberal party room. Chris Bowen runs to meet his speech obligations in the chamber. A reporter asks Anthony Albanese if the safeguard legislation is something the Indigenous voice to parliament would have an impact on. Albanese seems very exasperated: Of all the very strange questions I have been asked about the voice, that’s up there. You know, the voice is about matters that directly affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That’s what it’s about, and people shouldn’t look for the voice distractions. But they can if they want, they can ask all sorts of things about whether it will, you know, give advice on who should play five-eighth for Souths this week, but that is not what it is about. … The voice is not about defence policy. It’s not about foreign affairs policy, it’s not about these issues. The voice is about issues that directly affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Chris Bowen on whether the Greens amendments will stop projects like the Beetaloo basin by stealth: In terms of the facts, we always wanted aggregate pollution, absolute pollution, to come down. That’s why we’re creating safeguard mechanism credits to incentivise that. It’s appropriate that be represented in the act. And if for whatever reason that cap is being approached, the obligation on me is then to publicly consult, to amend the rules if I regard that, safeguard rules, that is the best approach, or to take other policy actions. Others can, you know, reach conclusions about the implications. In terms of your question how I’ll act – I’ll act according to the advice and the best policy available to the government at the time, and I’m sure future ministers of the day would. Chris Bowen, always a fast talker, is talking at triple speed today, as he has to run to the chamber very shortly to see the bill pass the House (and to give the summation to the debate). Energy minister Chris Bowen says the agreement with the Greens is in line with the “spirit” of the policy. They do two things – strengthen accountability, transparency and integrity of the scheme, and secondly, provide extra support for those strategic manufacturing industries that are so important for our economy and transition as well. In the interests of time, I have to go into the House to make sure it passes the House in a few minute. I’ll run you through the top lines briefly. Of course, I previously announced the government had previously announced $600 million of support for safeguard facilities. Also announcing an extra $400 million for those key strategic industries for the transition to ensure their ongoing presence in Australia as a sovereign capability – steel, aluminium and cement. In addition, for manufacturing, as well as a 3% revenue test for a reduced baseline, reproducing a new test based on the cost of abatement as a percentage of profit, which will support manufacturing. We are also making clear our intention in the act that … emissions must reduce over time, expressed as a five-year rolling arch, to take into account any short-term fluctuations. If the cap in terms of pollution, if the advice to me is that it would be exceeded, then I must consult on my policy options and as the minister of the day, either amend the rules or take any other policy action available to the government at that time. Back to the safeguard mechanism press conference Anthony Albanese and Chris Bowen are holding, the PM can’t help but throw in a few digs at the opposition: The safeguard mechanism is the vehicle to achieve our commitment for 43% reduction by 2030. That is a precondition as well for our engagement in the region and the world. We need to act on climate change. We can’t afford to continue to engage in conflict in this place in order to try to get the perfect outcome. And I’m pleased that the crossbenchers, in particular the Greens party, have held a press conference, I understand, and indicated their support. I want to thank the crossbenchers who have engaged constructively. It says a lot about the state of the Liberal and National parties in 2023 that in spite of the election result, they have excluded themselves from any participation. They’re the observers of Australian politics rather than the participants. I believe that we have a responsibility to participate and to achieve real solutions, to achieve real outcomes, to protect our manufacturers, to grow our economy while we’re dealing with emissions reduction. We have a huge opportunity to be a renewable energy superpower. We have an opportunity to take advantage of the fact we’re in the fastest-growing region of the world in human history. As my colleague Tory Shepherd has just reported, Richard Boyle, the Australian taxation office whistleblower, has lost his bid to use the nation’s whistleblowing protection laws to shield himself from criminal prosecution. Subject to any appeal, the decision means he again faces the prospect of a criminal trial for his alleged actions prior to blowing the whistle to the ABC on the ATO’s aggressive pursuit of debts. The decision has prompted immediate reaction. Human Rights Law Centre senior lawyer Kieran Pender said it showed the utter weaknesses of the Public Interest Disclosure Act (PID Act). Pender called for comprehensive reforms, including the establishment of a whistleblower protection authority. He also called on attorney general Mark Dreyfus to intervene and end the prosecution. Today’s decision is a major blow for Australian democracy. Whistleblowers should be protected, not prosecuted – and the Public Interest Disclosure Act was enacted to ensure just that. The court’s decision that Boyle’s whistleblowing on wrongdoing within the Australian Taxation Office was not covered by the PID Act shows that the law is utterly broken. This prosecution, and that of war crimes whistleblower David McBride, are unjust and undemocratic. The whistleblowing laws enacted by Mark Dreyfus when he was attorney general in 2013 have now failed both men. There is no public interest in either prosecution and it is high time that Dreyfus intervened to drop both cases, just as he dropped the [Bernard] Collaery case. The decision today only underscores the urgent need for law reform to ensure whistleblower protections are real and don’t just exist on paper. The attorney general should prioritise comprehensive reform to the PID Act and the establishment of a whistleblower protection authority. Whistleblowers make Australia a better place and our laws need to reflect that. Victorian Liberal meeting over Deeming continues The Victorian Liberal party room meeting is still going – they’ve been in there for just under two hours, with leader John Pesutto moving a motion to expel Moira Deeming from the party. A handful of MPs just went for a loo break and told us the vote hasn’t happened yet. Last week, another party room meeting also dragged on for a bit over two hours, with a group of MPs unsuccessfully moving a motion to delay the vote. Hopefully we have a result soon. Safeguard mechanism deal ‘a great day for our environment’, PM says Anthony Albanese and Chris Bowen are holding their press conference in the blue room (it is raining in Canberra, so no PM courtyard announcement). Labor is claiming victory over the safeguard mechanism: After a wasted decade under the Coalition, today is a very good day indeed. A great day for our environment, for jobs and for the economy. A good day for manufacturing, but a good day as well for all those who voted for a government to take action on climate change last May. The pollution trigger is something the Greens have been working towards for some time and it was something Labor gave some wriggle room. BUT the hard cap only kicks in once it is reached. So the cap would have to be reached before there was a stop to emissions trading. The Greens say the cap will be 140 megatonnes (but there are still some questions to be answered) So we will have to wait and see what the numbers are. Let’s see if the government has any more answers. So the Greens didn’t get “no new coal and gas projects”. But what it did get was a hard cap in the legislation, which can not be exceeded through safeguards. And Adam Bandt says that cap would be exceeded if Labor approved new coal and gas projects – that it wouldn’t be able to pass the projects on account of the pollution they would emit. Anthony Albanese and Chris Bowen have called a press conference for 11.45am, or when this one with the Greens ends. And finally, the Greens say they have also secured: Increased methane monitoring, leading to greater coal and gas emissions reductions. A Climate Change Authority-led sectoral emission reduction plans to make it harder for coal and gas projects to get financed and to support the litigation of greenwashing. For the first time, the act will require reporting of all types of gases and offset generation use, creating greater transparency and pressure on corporations to do more. Continuing on from the previous post: All new gas fields for LNG export will need to be net zero CO2 from day one. The agreement will significantly improve the integrity of ACCUs with a freeze on the most dubious offset class (human-induced regeneration) until they are subject to an independent audit. The bill will include a requirement for incentives for onsite abatement and to ensure facilities are encouraged to actually cut pollution Corporations will be required to justify their use of offsets if they use offsets for more than 30% of their baseline. A review by the CCA in 2026-27 will look at the use of offsets and implementing measures to restrict their use if on-site abatement isn’t occurring to satisfactory levels. The Powering the Regions fund will not be used to fund coal or gas projects. The grant funding power the Liberal government used to subsidise fossil fuel projects will be changed in the act to prevent funding for extracting coal and gas. What does the deal between the Greens and Labor look like on the safeguard mechanism? It includes: A hard cap or ceiling on actual or absolute (gross) emissions, which won’t be able to exceed current pollution levels (140 MT per annum), and there will be a decreasing cap over time. Pollution will actually now go down, not up, and the coal and gas corporations can’t buy their way out of it with offsets. This puts a limit on coal and gas expansion in Australia. Actual pollution from safeguard entities was forecast to rise under Labor’s original safeguard, from about 140MT now to between 155-184MT in 2030. A pollution trigger in the safeguard mechanism bill that will require the climate change minister to test a new or expanded project’s impact on the hard cap and net carbon budgets. If the assessment finds that the project would contribute to exceeding the cap or budget, the minister must consult and recalibrate the rules (such as by limiting ACCUs, reducing the value of ACCUs or adjusting the decline rates of baselines) or impose conditions on new entrants. Using these wide-ranging powers, the minister could set baselines at zero and ACCU allowance at zero, effectively stopping a project from proceeding. The minister’s action or lack of action would be subject to legal enforcement. Approvals under the EPBC and advice from the Climate Change Authority would trigger the assessment, as would assessment of emissions data and forecasts. All scope 1 emissions from the Beetaloo gas project will have to be net-zero, with scope 2 and 3 emissions referred to the Ministerial Energy Council. This will be a significant financial barrier in the way of the project proceeding. Adam Bandt is winding up his comments here: I want to say to everyone who despairs about the future under our climate crisis and who is worried about their lives or their kids’ or their grand kids’, you should have a spring in your step today because we have shown that it is possible to take on the coal and gas corporations and win. But there is a lot more that we need to do. What is clear is that now we need to build a movement to take on the coal and gas corporations and the government who does their bidding to stop every one of the other ones still left in the pipeline from going ahead. We will be working hard now to fight to get a proper climate trigger in our environment laws, to stop the remaining fossil fuel subsidies going to the coal and gas corporations in the budget, and we will be fighting and standing side-by-side with all of those communities that are right around the country, for the Beetaloo to the Barossa to Narrabri who are fighting to stop the destruction of country and the fast-tracking of climate collapse by the opening of new coal and gas projects. That is where we’ll go to now. Adam Bandt: The Beetaloo gas field will be required from day one to offset all of its emissions – scope one, scope two and scope three – for domestic use. This derails the business case for the Beetaloo. On some estimates, based on the level – we don’t know exactly what the level of the price of offsetting permits will be – on some estimates, this could add up to an additional billion dollars a year to the Beetaloo project, potentially ensuring that it doesn’t go ahead. Now, it hasn’t been finally stopped, but it has been derailed. And this will be a huge, huge shot in the arm to the campaigners against the Beetaloo project. Likewise, all new offshore gas projects that will be feeding in to LNG terminals will be required to be zero CO2 from day one. Now, given that so many of these projects are big and have lots of CO2 in them, this will also add a substantial cost to these projects and put a huge hurdle in the way of them proceeding. We have also secured a number of other amendments including stopping large amounts of public money going to funding new coal and gas. Adam Bandt: On our initial calculations, this means that the equivalent emissions from about half of those 116 projects is prevented. That means about half of those 116 projects and their equivalent emissions won’t be able to go ahead. There will be, in law for the first time in this country, a limit on the amount of pollution that these corporations including the coal and gas corporations, can pollute. And if pollution starts to rise above that, and the Minister doesn’t take steps to fix it, they’ll be breaking the law. This will be in legislation. Not only that, but for the first time, new projects that are proposed to enter the system will have to pass a pollution test. There will be a safeguard trigger in the legislation that means that if new projects coming in look likely to breach the cap, then the Minister has to do something about it. The Minister will have the powers under the legislation to take steps to stop the pollution going up including potentially stopping the project by putting restrictions on them. This is a first in legislation because for the first time, new projects for coal and gas will now have to undergo a pollution test and that wasn’t there before. We have also put significant hurdles in the way of a number of the projects currently underway in the pipeline that the government and others have been backing. Adam Bandt continues: Under the original design of the safeguard mechanism, pollution from coal and gas was going to go up. For those who are interested in the numbers, the pollution from the entities covered by the safeguard mechanism was, is about 140 megatonnes now. Under the projections, under Labor’s scheme, it was going to go up between 155 and 184 megatonnes. That’s how much Labor wanted to expand coal and gas in their original safeguard design. Any good climate policy should be stopping that, but Labor wanted to expand it. So as you know, the Greens have been pushing hard on new coal and gas because coal and gas are the main causes of the climate crisis and as the UN secretary general has said if we’re to get the climate crisis under control, we have to stop opening coal and gas mines. The Greens, through the negotiations, have secured a big hit on coal and gas. There will now be, in legislation, a hard cap on actual emissions that the safeguard sector can emit. This puts a limit on coal and gas expansion in this country. In fact, the limit must decline over time. This means a huge number of those 116 coal and gas projects in the pipeline will not be able to go ahead. This cap will be a hard cap on actual emissions and the coal and gas corporations will not be able to offset their way out of it, no matter how many offsets they buy. Bandt lashes Labor after deal on emissions safeguard mechanism Adam Bandt is now speaking to the media about the deal he has struck with the Labor party in regards to the industry emissions safeguard mechanism: What I’m about to say isn’t any comment on how they conducted the negotiations or the spirit of them, but it’s about – one of the things that has become readily apparent about this place and this parliament, negotiating with Labor is like negotiating with the political wing of the coal and gas corporations. Labor seems more afraid of the coal and gas corporations than climate collapse. Labor seems more afraid of Woodside than global warming. And neither has it been clearer than in the couple of public statements in the public positions we have seen other recent weeks – on the day that the world scientists and the UN secretary general gave us our final warning and said countries like Australia need to stop opening coal and gas mines, the government defended more coal and gas mines. … It’s become readily apparent that we are dealing here in this parliament with a government that is still captured by the coal and gas corporations was when it came to the original design of the safeguard mechanism. There is lots of waiting now. Waiting for the outcome of the Moria Deeming vote. Waiting for the details of the deal the Greens and Labor have made in regards to the safeguard mechanism. Allegra Spender supports cheaper batteries bill Back in the house and Wentworth independent MP Allegra Spender is backing Helen Haines’ bill for cheaper batteries: Cheaper home batteries are a climate and a cost of living imperative for all Australia. But without a helping hand from government, we won’t achieve the pace of uptake that we need. Because although home batteries are coming down in price all the time, the up-front costs of between $7,000 and $15,000 remain a significant barrier for many. This is one of the reasons why only 35,000 households installed a battery in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. Whilst this was an increase on 2020 – but it is less than a tenth of the number of rooftop solar installations in the same year. And it’s a far cry from the hundreds of thousands we need to install each year if we are to electrify Australia’s 10 million households over the next decade. Further to Paul’s post, the Greens have announced a press conference for 11.15 to discuss the safeguard mechanism agreement. ATO whistleblower Richard Boyle will face a trial and potential prison term after the South Australian district court denied his application to be considered immune from prosecution under the Public Interest Disclosure Act. Boyle’s case was a significant test for whistleblower protections, and the reasons for the decision have been put under an interim suppression order. Guardian Australia understands that the Greens have met this morning and approved a deal with the Albanese government on the safeguard mechanism. The deal stops short of endorsing the Greens’ demand for no new coal and gas projects, which the climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has repeatedly ruled out. Last week we reported that Labor could agree to treat existing non-fossil fuel industries – such as cement, aluminium and steel – differently to new coal and gas developments in a bid to reach agreement with the Greens on a signature climate policy. We expect an announcement later this morning with the details. Helen Haines calls for cheaper batteries for households Meanwhile, Indi independent Helen Haines is introducing a bill into the parliament to try to make batteries cheaper for households to help with the transition to renewables: It’s not just improving household savings that would be achieved under this bill. Batteries provide a reliable energy source during times of emergencies like bushfires and storms, when our powerlines fail us – in places like Corryong and the Alpine areas. They are also a critical part of reducing our national emissions. If 500,000 batteries are installed, that’s the equivalent of taking 500,000 cars off the road each and every year. Batteries will reduce our power bills, secure our energy supply and reduce our emissions. It should be a no-brainer for the government to provide that extra help so households can afford them. This bill gets this done. Little bit of a response to the private member’s bill Henry Pike introduced into the parliament – you can find out more about his bid to cement Australia Day as 26 January here. Meanwhile in Sydney: Queensland MP pushes to ensure Australia Day date isn’t moved Henry Pike, an LNP MP from Queensland, has submitted a private member’s bill to the parliament. So what is the concern of the Bowman MP? What is the first order of business from a Coalition MP following the NSW Liberals loss where people voted for more progressive candidates? Australia Day. Or, more specifically, that Australia Day not be moved from 26 January. The primary purpose of this bill is to enshrine Australia’s national day in federal law. The provisions in this bill are the same as those used to enshrine Anzac Day as a national day of commemoration through the Anzac Day Act 1983. The date of Australia Day would be formally established as 26 January. This legislative protection ensures that Australia Day must remain as a national day and cannot be abolished by the actions of the government. The remainder of the bill provides an avenue through which the date of Australia Day could be changed in the future. This process would be the same prescribed in the Flags Act 1953 for changing the design of Australia’s national flag, namely through a national plebiscite. How a national plebiscite on Australia Day would be formed and conducted will be at the discretion of the parliament. However, any alternate proposals must include 26 January as an option that can be selected by voters in the plebiscite. Those qualified to vote in federal elections would be qualified to vote on any proposal for an alternate date for Australia’s national day. It is up to the government when private member’s bills come to the parliament for a vote. Can’t say this one will rate too highly on government business. ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott believes recent bank collapses overseas have more in common with the savings and loans disaster that gripped the US in the 1980s than the global financial crisis. The comments, posted on the bank’s website on Monday, come amid a turbulent period for the sector, triggered by the collapse of California-based Silicon Valley Bank, and Switzerland government-backed rescue of Credit Suisse. There are growing fears of contagion after investors also sold-down shares in Germany’s biggest lender, Deutsche Bank, late last week. Elliott said: The GFC was fundamentally a crisis around the quality of assets and the loans that banks make, and that’s not what the risk is here. This is a different issue. This is really to do with the global war on inflation and how central banks are raising rates very quickly in order to combat that, and that has casualties. The 1980s savings and loans crisis came during a period of rising interest rates that cut the profitability of many lenders in the US. The lenders were also not able to attract enough depositors, eroding the stability of bank operations. This differs from the GFC collapses from 2008, which were linked to banks making excessive bets on the US subprime mortgage market. Elliott said the recent banking issues in the US and Europe could turn into a broader financial disaster, adding it was too early to tell. Every five to 10 years there’s something going on in the world. And so we shouldn’t be surprised, in a funny way, that things like this happen. It’s too early to call it – I mean, it’s a crisis for some, obviously – but is it a financial crisis, who knows? Does it have the potential to be one? Yes, it does. IMF warns on China temperature rise’s economic risks Days after the IPCC issued a “final warning” about the need to cut said emissions, the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, noted temperatures were rising faster in China than the global average. GDP losses would be in the order of 2.3% a year by 2030, and rising, the IMF reckons. (Within China, the drying out of the northern plains, the loss of snow-caps that provide water for millions in the west, and rising sea levels and storm surge risks in the east are among the threats in a hotter world.) She said: [O]ur research shows such rebalancing could lead to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 15% over the next three decades. [T]his translates into benefits for the whole world: a fall in global emissions of 4.5% over the same period. Whether or not nations listen to the IMF’s advice is another thing. (They don’t like Australia’s property bubble, for one thing.) Still, as we saw last month, there’s a race of sorts between China’s much-touted rush into renewables and electric vehicles, and its ongoing binge of building new coal-fired power plants: There’s a lot riding on who wins that race. The International Monetary Fund has gently told China to shift its economic model to favour consumption over investment and make lifting productivity a priority to lower its greenhouse gas emissions to the benefit of all. In a speech to the 2023 China Development Forum in Beijing on Sunday, Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, noted that China’s faster growth would help buoy economies in the region (including Australia’s, which she didn’t mention). The IMF reckons China’s GDP growth will quicken to 5.2%, or about 2 percentage points faster than in 2022. “The robust rebound means China is set to account for around one third of global growth in 2023,” Georgieva said. “A 1 percentage point increase in GDP growth in China leads to 0.3 percentage point increase in growth in other Asian economies, on average—a welcome boost.” That’s all well and good - and perhaps a reason why Victorian premier Dan Andrews is flying to China to spruik that state’s economic prospects, including for foreign students. But more interesting is the IMF’s advice about the need for China to “rebalance the economy away from investment and towards more consumption-driven growth that is more durable, less reliant on debt, and will also help address climate challenges”. Such a shift would lift productivity of the economy by around 18% by 2037, helping to offset the pressures of a shrinking economy. But the benefits go further, particularly if the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter acts to cut pollution. Victorian MP Nick McGowan says he supports Deeming Liberal upper house MP Nick McGowan says he’ll be backing Moira Deeming. Speaking ahead of party room meeting, he said: My mother raised me to do what is right … I don’t believe for a second that Moira is a Nazi, a Nazi sympathiser or has any association with Nazis. It’s incumbent, I think, upon each and every one of us here as human beings, as reporters – who I defend – to make sure whatever the vote here today is, that when you write, when you publish, when you report, you keep that foremost in your mind. At the end of this day we’re dealing with a human being, an intelligent, creative woman. That’s not to say that I nor you … will agree with all her views on all matter of subjects, but it would remiss of me not to make that comment here today. Important to note Pesutto is not alleging any of the above. He alleges Deeming’s position as “untenable” after her “involvement in … promoting and participating in a rally with speakers and other organisers who themselves have been publicly associated with far rightwing extremist groups including neo-Nazi activists”. Deeming denies wrongdoing. Communications minister Michelle Rowland says the federal government is considering the possibility of further regulating dating apps, as the commonwealth continues its investigation of online safety around the services. Further to Rowland’s morning media interviews, which Amy brought you earlier, the minister gave a short doorstop press conference in the Parliament House press gallery this morning. Her office this morning announced Rowland had “issued a detailed information request to the top ten online dating services used by Australians about the extent of harms occurring on their services, and the safety policies and procedures they have in place to keep their Australian users safe”. That information includes the number of reports the apps had received about sexual harassment and abuse, user bans, referrals to police, and the processes in place to keep banned users from creating new accounts. Rowland said research had found three in four Australians using the apps have experienced some form of harm, but also that dating apps are the most common way to meet a new partner for young people, so the government was looking at further action. Rowland said in her doorstop: If we don’t get the kinds of responses we think should be forthcoming, we will consider further regulation here. One of them could be, and this isn’t novel because it’s used across broadcasting and telco sectors, is some form of code of practice that is devised by the industry which could be subject to regulatory oversight and enforcement. Work is still ongoing with state and territory attorneys general, the federal eSafety commissioner and relationship services, but Rowland said the recent focus on the sector – including a roundtable on safety in January – had seen apps voluntarily set up their own extra safety features. It’s pleasing to see the focus on this area has had the effect of incentivising regulation in this area, with some of these dating apps introducing new safety features. Some of them, we’ve questioned why they are behind some paywall services because everyone should be entitled to safety. It’s pleasing this has already focused the minds of these app providers on what they need to do better. In a release this morning, Rowland and social services minister Amanda Rishworth said the government would “continue to put pressure on online dating services to be transparent about the safety of their users, making clear that services will be held to account for sexual harassment and abuse facilitated by their platforms”. The barriers give this real Queensland LNP leadership spill energy. Assistant minister Tim Ayres to talk trade and climate on China trip We are still not sure when trade minister Don Farrell will be heading to China, but we know that his assistant minister, Tim Ayres, is on his way. Ayres will take part in the Bo’ao forum – and is the first Australian minister to participate since 2016. He said: The Bo’ao forum provides a platform for high\\-level dialogue between governments, business, academics and other non-government organisations to discuss regional economic and trade issues. In addition to engaging in a series of meetings to discuss trade and investment, I will participate in a panel session exploring the future of clean energy. I will use the panel discussion to highlight the Albanese government’s strong action on climate change, which has put us in the front row to capitalise on trade and investment opportunities from the global transition to net zero. Daniel Andrews has also headed to Beijing: (Posters are hoping for an update to the infamous phone meme. Sadly, I don’t think they’ll get their wish granted.) I’ve covered many a Liberal spill in my time at Victorian parliament and never have we had this sort of set up restricting access to MPs as they come in and out of the party room. Benita Kolovos has pointed us in the direction of this tweet – Sam Groth is a moderate. Federal secrecy provisions reviewed The commonwealth secrecy provisions are under review. Attorney general Mark Dreyfus is asking for consultation on these aspects of the provisions: What principles should govern the framing of general and specific secrecy offences in commonwealth legislation Whether any general or specific secrecy offences should be amended or repealed What defences should be available for general and specific secrecy offences What principles should govern the framing of the public interest journalism defence and should any amendments be considered. Submissions for the consultation process close on 4 May 2023 and the review’s final report will be delivered to government by 30 June 2023. The review’s consultation paper can be found here. Deeming arrives at Victorian parliament ahead of vote on her fate Victorian Liberal MP Moira Deeming has arrived at the state’s parliament ahead of a vote to determine her future in the party room. Deeming arrived at parliament accompanied by Renee Heath, who held an umbrella over her colleague’s head. The pair were joined by Richord Riordan, who last week made a failed attempt to delay the vote, and Bev McArthur, Nick McGowan and Joe McCracken. The group of conservative MPs are believed to be voting against the motion. Opposition leader John Pesutto launched a bid to expel Deeming after she attended a rally headlined by British anti-transgender activist Kellie-Jay Keen where neo-Nazis were photographed performing the Nazi salute last weekend. Deeming has denied wrongdoing. Good morning from the Victorian parliament. In an hour’s time, a special party room meeting will be held by Liberal leader John Pesutto to expel Moira Deeming from the parliamentary party. Pesutto has sought to expel Deeming after she attended a rally headlined by British anti-transgender activist Kellie-Jay Keen where neo-Nazis were photographed performing the Nazi salute last weekend. Deeming has denied wrongdoing. The vote has been considered an early test for Pesutto, who took over the leadership following November’s election loss vowing to bring the party back to the centre after years of infighting between socially liberal and conservative MPs. There are 31 members in the state Liberal party room, meaning Pesutto needs at least 16 votes for his motion to succeed. Unsurprisingly, he’s found support for his motion from the party’s moderate faction, while those opposing are from the conservative faction of the party and former leadership rivals. Polwarth MP Richard Riordan, who last week made a failed attempt to delay the vote, arrived at parliament early and was seen with fellow conservative MP Joe McCracken. It is believed they will be voting against the motion along with Chris Crewther, Renee Heath, Ann-Marie Hermans and Bev McArthur. Guardian Australia has spoken to several Liberal MPs who have suggested should Deeming be expelled, Pesutto could still face instability in the long term unless his motion has a “resounding victory”. My colleague Adeshola Ore and I will have updates throughout the morning. David Pocock has been working on these issues since he came into the parliament – and today’s report showing that the community wants more done is only going to bolster that work. Given his importance to the federal government getting legislation through the Senate, something is going to have to give. Joyce says NSW wanted ‘a change’ after 12 years of Coalition Former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce also thinks the NSW election result was down to “it’s time”. He told the Seven network: I don’t think splitting the Coalition achieves an awful lot, but that’s a decision that my colleagues in New South Wales have to make. I really do think it’s a time to change the curtains. The curtains were working perfectly well, but after 12 years, people want a change. But now, with the Labor party all across Australia, they’ve got no one else to blame. But they’ve got to look after the cost of living, so food prices are their issue, power prices are their issue, fuel prices are their issue, rent is their issue, and they’ve got no excuses, because that’s the biggest issue on people’s minds. They’ve got to fix it. Meanwhile, doesn’t look like the Liberals want the media coming too close as MPs enter the party room meeting which will decide Moira Deeming’s fate within the party. Fletcher warns voters against turning to independents Paul Fletcher wouldn’t get drawn into whether the NSW Liberals’ embrace of climate change policies helped starve off the teal independent challenge in NSW state electorates. Instead, he warned against voters turning to independents. He said that the voting landscape was now 30% rusted-on Labor, 30% rusted-on Coalition and 40% floating. That, Fletcher said, presented a danger that people might start voting against (gasp) the two party system: One of the big dangers that we face is the idea that if you keep adding more and more independents, it doesn’t threaten the stability of government. It’s very important we don’t end up a country like Israel; like Belgium, where I think after one election for 10 months, they were wrangling about who is going to form government; like Italy, where government changes regularly. The two party system has served both our nation and our states. Well, now the imperative is on us as a Liberal party to make the case at both federal and state level as to our capacity to govern in the interests of the broader community, and we’ll obviously continue to do that at federal level and at state level to make that case very strong. Fletcher won’t offer ‘gratuitous advice’ on Moira Deeming move The vote on whether or not first term Victorian upper house Liberal Moira Deeming will remain in the Liberal party is to be held today (there is a party room meeting in just under two hours). Does Paul Fletcher support the bid to expel Deeming from the party? What I support is that the leader in Victoria and the party room in Victoria. My Victorian state colleagues will make the decision that they determine is in the best interests of the Liberal party but, more importantly, of the people of Victoria who they seek to serve. So I won’t be offering gratuitous advice from the sidelines. They’ve got an important responsibility and I’m sure they’ll discharge that as they judge is the best way to do so. Fletcher will not go into whether he would be concerned at anyone in his party room attending an anti-trans rights protest. I’m not going to be offering commentary on these matters. Is there a place for those views in the Liberal party? I’m not going to be commenting on hypotheticals. Patricia Karvelas tries again – does he believe there is room for those views in the Liberal party room? My view is that we are a party with a diverse range of views. And what’s very important is that we can have a vigorous exchange of views within our party room. We take our internal party democracy, democratic process very seriously. And that is how it should be. And look, I’m not going to get into ruling in or ruling out particular viewpoints on this or any other issue in an abstract, hypothetical way. Fletcher won’t say if he’ll seek another term Paul Fletcher won’t answer the question of whether or not he will run again in Bradfield. He is dancing around this question like he is auditioning for the new Fred Astaire biopic. (Tom Holland has the role, and anyone who has seen his Umbrella dance will know why.) I continue to consider serving the people of Bradfield to be an enormous privilege and … any rational politician always considers what they’re going to do as you come to the end of each term. I’ve done that before the end of each past term, but what I can tell you is it’s an honour to serve the people of Bradfield. I continue to be committed to it, energetic in doing, so I spent most of Saturday across a whole range of polling booths engaging with my constituents. I enjoyed it. I found it energising, and I believe that the Liberal party has a very important role in serving the people of Australia and certainly in serving the people of Bradfield and that’s something I’m committed to. Fletcher puts NSW election loss down to long incumbency Federal Liberal MP Paul Fletcher, whose electorate of Bradfield covers northern Sydney, is now speaking to ABC radio RN Breakfast and he thinks the NSW election loss was down to time. I think the first point is that after three terms and 12 years, inevitably, it becomes harder to win a fourth term. It’s the nature of our democracy, of Australian democracy, that the electorate starts to look for alternatives. And of course, 12 years of good government – extraordinary rollout of infrastructure, Metro north-west Metro City and south-east West connects north, connects new schools, hospitals all across Sydney, all across New South Wales – a government with a very good track record. But inevitably, after 12 years, it’s not surprising that people look for a change. That’s that’s been a pattern in Australian politics for decades. Constitutional law expert professor Greg Craven has disagreed. He said last week the inclusion of executive government could open it up to all sorts of challenges. Bret Walker says in his experience, that will not be the case. These are not laws which will hand over to the voice without parliament being able to control it, the extent to which weight has to be given to what the voice says by the executive government from time to time. That’s within the parliament’s control. And it is simply not the case that there is any prospect of litigation that would cause even a slight tick up to executive government. Executive government lives day by day in the courts of this country with checks on its lawfulness, ultimately administered by the court. That’s not only not a bad thing … that’s exactly what courts are for and what the rule of law means. So no, there is no trick, there is no inconvenience for government. And there is, in particular, in this recently announced wording, here is the double precaution against any such prospect emerging. Barrister says voice question won’t open floodgates to constitutional challenges On Thursday, the referendum question for the Indigenous voice to parliament will be introduced into the parliament. That doesn’t mean it will be the final wording – there is a parliamentary committee process and that could lead to some changes. And it also hasn’t stopped the calls for “detail”, primarily from the opposition, with critics saying it could open the floodgates to constitutional challenges. One of the high court’s busiest barristers, Bret Walker SC, told ABC radio RN Breakfast no. What does Walker think of the wording and principles released by the prime minister? They seem to me to be a very safe formula with a bit of a double precaution against some of the notions that were floated by opponents. So, for example, there’s absolutely no possibility now that parliament will not be able to control the manner in which the executive, for example, will deal with representations by the voice. All of that now has been put beyond any doubt by the explicit capacity of parliaments from time to time to check adjust and control the way in which procedures will operate. Aston byelection looms All eyes are now on the Aston byelection, which could also end up deciding Peter Dutton’s leadership. It would be historic if Labor won the seat. Not just because it has been a Liberal stronghold but because governments don’t win byelections from oppositions as a general rule. But there is a lot of chatter that Labor is doing better in Aston than it is saying and that the contest is closer than is comfortable for the Liberals. Does Michelle Rowland think that the mood from NSW will carry into the Aston byelection in Melbourne on Saturday? She is not saying: I think it would be quite extraordinary for government to win a by election like this of the opposition party, not even a year into its first term, but that will be up to the voters of Aston to decide in a few days. ‘He’s also very committed to harm minimisation’ So would Michelle Rowland like to see Chris Minns and Labor adopt the stronger gambling policy the Liberals took to the election? Not exactly. Well, he went to the election with a clear policy in this area, people made their decision there. This is an area that is regulated under state law and I expect that he will hold true to his election commitments. And I also expect that as premier he will be open and consultative about that process. That he’s also very committed to harm minimisation and that he will ensure that what the community expects in terms of delivering on his commitments he fulfils. ‘Chris Minns spent a lot of time in western Sydney’ Michelle Rowland is a NSW Labor MP, so what did she take from the NSW Labor win? I think it came down to probably two factors. The first is there was certainly a sense of this is was a tired government. But I think that it was more nuanced than that. I think Chris Minns asked a very genuine question – do you really think this government’s best days are ahead of them? And I think that prompted people to consider not only the then current premier, but also everything that had gone on in the past, how their quality of life had progressed. But I also think that there is there’s something going on in the outer and growth suburbs of our metropolitan areas, but also our regional areas, like around Monaro. There’s something going on there where the electorate expects a certain level of services and good planning, so that they can have confidence in the future. They have the right health services, education, that they have the infrastructure that they need. And I think in these areas, those electors felt let down after 12 years, and I think by picking up on that by being very engaged, particularly in north-west and south-west Sydney, I know that one of his first acts as coming to Labor leader, which wasn’t even two years ago, was that Chris Minns spent a lot of time in western Sydney even when we went into lockdown. He also spent a lot of time in western Sydney, doing things for the community, packing hampers for people who were in isolation. So I think he demonstrated he was someone who was very in touch with those basic needs. Gambling harm minimisation plans Communications minister Michelle Rowland is out and about early this morning talking up the government’s harm minimisation reforms when it comes to gambling. Rowland drew controversy a little while ago when it was revealed she had accepted donations and hospitality from online gambling giant Sportsbet while the shadow minister. Now as the minister with responsibility for online gambling, Rowland is having to work to ensure people have trust that she will go far enough in regulating that industry. Rowland tells ABC radio RN Breakfast: It’s clear that we have an agenda to minimise harm and to keep Australians safe, and that includes in relation to people who are vulnerable and at risk of harm in this space. The entire premise here is about harm minimisation. We went into we were in opposition, having a strong track record on harm minimisation, we’ve come into government with a clear agenda in this area. We are actually doing more in our first year about tackling this problem, getting the right settings, getting the evidence and setting an agenda than the last government had in its entire term. So I expect that this government and myself as minister will be judged on our record. It’s very clear that we understand the community expects action in this area. I’ve made my position very clear in relation to those other matters. And I’m getting on with the job. The government has launched an inquiry into some of the issues surrounding online gambling, including limiting exposure to children. Welcome to the last sitting week before the budget! Labor is hoping the message from NSW will carry over into its safeguard negotiations so it can wrap them up in time for its 1 July carbon trading deadline – but the Greens are also pointing to the more progressive vote to try to prod the government into going further. The same battle is playing out over the housing future fund. The Greens think the government can go further than 30,000 homes in the first five years. David Pocock and Jacqui Lambie agree. Labor says it has the balance right but that doesn’t mean anything if it can’t convince the Senate. The government’s workplace gender equality bill will be introduced this week to try to close the gender pay gap (companies will have to publish their gap with the idea being transparency will bring about change) and, on Thursday, the wording for the Indigenous voice to parliament will be introduced in the house. So it’s a busy week. And one starting with Labor on a high from its win in NSW. You may have noticed the Coalition wasn’t mentioned in that legislation negotiation rundown – that’s because it’s written itself out of the negotiations by saying no from the beginning. Today the federal Coalition party room will have a bit of reckoning of its own – mainland Australia is wall-to-wall red. John Howard has told the Australian newspaper that Labor’s hold on power is “brittle” and won’t last long. The Queensland election is not until October 2024 and that will be the first chance the LNP has to win back some power, so it’s going to last a little over a year and a half (unless, of course, the rumours Anthony Albanese will call a snap election for early next year play out). Unlike 2007, the Coalition is still trying to work out what it stands for. All those seeds Howard planted, turning the Liberal party into a party of conservatives, have now borne fruit. This IS Howard’s party and voters haven’t exactly embraced it. Demographic changes mean younger voters hold the power now and they are, so far, becoming more progressive. Yet the overwhelming calls from within the Coalition house have been to go further to the right to win back voters. It’s going to be a long ride. So strap in as we take you through today. You have Amy Remeikis on the blog, with Mike Bowers in the hallways (yay). Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst are in Canberra while the rest of the Guardian brains trust will keep you updated on what’s happening beyond Capital Hill.

The Social Democratic party leader, Antti Rinne, who formed the five-party alliance of centrist, leftist and Green parties after narrowly beating the nationalist Finns party in an election in April, said it was time to “invest in the future” after years of austerity. Pekka Haavisto, the Green League party chair, said the programme – which will increase public spending by €1.23bn (£1.1bn) a year and spend another €3bn on one-off investments, notably in the rail network, over the four-year lifetime of the government – was “probably the most ambitious in the world” on climate issues. Climate campaigners welcomed the announcement. “People demanded faster climate action and that’s what we’re going to get,” said Sini Harkki, the Finland programme manager of Greenpeace Nordic. “Building the world’s first fossil-free, sustainable society is going to require much more than nice words on paper, but we’re determined to make it happen. It’s an exciting journey we want to embark on.” Harkki said the government’s programme, which will have major implications for the country’s key forestry industry and use of peat for energy, was far from perfect. But with “the broad public support we now have for transformational change, the fights can be won”, she said. The government programme followed an election in which the climate crisis emerged as Finnish voters’ number one concern. A survey for the previous centre-right government found 80% of Finns felt urgent climate action was necessary, with 70% of respondents saying the new government must do more. Besides cutting back on planned logging investments, the 2035 carbon neutral target – which is to be written into law – will require Finland to radically reduce its consumption of fossil fuels and peat, which together supply about 40% of the country’s energy needs. The programme calls for a rapid increase in wind and solar power production, the electrification of heating and transport, and a 10% increase in bioenergy, mainly from agricultural waste and forest residues. The target should not involve Finland buying credits for CO2-reducing projects in other countries, the government said, although that would be subject to a review scheduled for 2025. To fund the increased spending, the government plans to raise taxes by €730m, much of it through fossil fuel levies, and sell off up to €2.5bn of state assets, according to the 190-page policy document. It also aims to raise Finland’s employment rate to 75% from 72.4% in April. Rinne, the country’s first leftist prime minister in 20 years, said his administration’s plans were aimed squarely at reducing income differences in Finland through increased spending on education, pensions and social services. Austerity measures imposed by the outgoing centre-right government succeeded in cutting public spending by €4bn and reducing Finland’s debt for the first time in a decade, but made it deeply unpopular. Ten parties won seats in the 14 April election, with Rinne’s Social Democrats capturing 17.7% of the vote, beating the Finns by 7,666 votes. The nationalist, Eurosceptic Finns were excluded from the coalition talks, with Rinne opting instead to partner with the Centre party of the outgoing prime minister, Juha Sipilä, as his main coalition ally, in addition to the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People’s party of Finland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2019/may/31/great-britain-records-two-weeks-of-coal-free-electricity-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-31T15:29:48Z","webTitle":"Great Britain records two weeks of coal-free electricity generation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/31/great-britain-records-two-weeks-of-coal-free-electricity-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2019/may/31/great-britain-records-two-weeks-of-coal-free-electricity-generation","fields":{"headline":"Great Britain records two weeks of coal-free electricity generation","bodyText":"Great Britain has hit a new power milestone – lasting for a fortnight without using any coal power to generate electricity for the first time since the industrial revolution. The system which supplies electricity across England, Scotland and Wales went for two weeks without coal at 3:12pm BST precisely, according to the National Grid Electricity System Operator. The latest landmark comes less than a month after Britain’s first week without coal, underlining the dramatic decline in its use in recent years. Coal has been used for electricity generation since 1882, when a plant opened in Holborn, London. However in 2018 the fuel made up just 5% of Britain’s electricity generation, a big decline from about 40% in 2012, according to figures from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Coal has mainly been replaced by natural gas, which produces less than half the carbon dioxide emissions. Renewable sources with no direct carbon emissions, such as solar and wind power, accounted for 28% of electricity generation in 2018, according to the power company Drax. The British record for solar power has also been beaten this month. On 14 May the country generated 25% of its power from the sun. Modelling by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that coal use for energy generation globally will have to be reduced to close to zero in every scenario in which global temperature increases are limited to 1.5C. Seven coal-fired power stations remain in use in the UK, mainly as backups during cold periods when energy demands are high. The Cottam plant in north Nottinghamshire will close in September, after owners EDF Energy said it was no longer economical to run it. The government last year revealed plans to shut down all coal-fired power stations by 2025, but it has come under pressure to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels after parliament declared a climate emergency at the start of the month. Business leaders and leading scientists this week urged the calls for the government to legislate for a target of net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases from the UK economy by 2050, as recommended by the committee on climate change, the government’s independent climate advisors. In a letter to the prime minister, business leaders urged the government to “act immediately to put in legislation” to meet the 2050 target. The letter was signed by senior executives of companies including BT, Iceland, Legal &amp; General, Sainsbury’s and John Lewis. The Labour party has already committed to the 2050 target, adding to the pressure on the government. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow energy secretary, said: “The roll-out of renewable energy is far too slow and the government are set to miss their existing emissions reductions targets. “We join with businesses in urging the government to bring forward the UK’s emission reduction targets and implementing a pathway to get there.” Government policy is that the UK is “on a path” to making the legal commitment to reduce net carbon emissions to zero. However, distracted by the imminent departure of Theresa May as prime minister – the government has so far not introduced statutory instruments to set the legally binding commitment. Chris Skidmore, the energy and clean growth minister, said the government was “consigning coal to the history books”. He said the government “aim[s] to become the first major economy to legislate for a net-zero emissions economy and bid to host pivotal climate talks in 2020”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/10/indian-solar-power-prices-hit-record-low-undercutting-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-10T12:29:29Z","webTitle":"Indian solar power prices hit record low, undercutting fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/10/indian-solar-power-prices-hit-record-low-undercutting-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/10/indian-solar-power-prices-hit-record-low-undercutting-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"Indian solar power prices hit record low, undercutting fossil fuels","bodyText":"Wholesale solar power prices have reached another record low in India, faster than analysts predicted and further undercutting the price of fossil fuel-generated power in the country. The tumbling price of solar energy also increases the likelihood that India will meet – and by its own predictions, exceed – the renewable energy targets it set at the Paris climate accords in December 2015. India is the world’s third-largest carbon polluter, with emissions forecast to at least double as it seeks to develop its economy and lift hundreds of millions of citizens out of poverty. Ensuring it generates as much of that energy as possible from renewable sources is considered crucial to limiting catastrophic global temperature increases. At a reverse auction in Rajasthan on Tuesday, power companies Phelan Energy and Avaada Power each offered to charge 2.62 rupees per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated from solar panels they hope to build at an energy park in the desert state. Last year’s previous record lowest bid was 4.34 rupees per kWh . Analysts called the 40% price drop “world historic” and said it was driven by cheaper finance and growing investor confidence in India’s pledge to dramatically increase its renewable energy capacity. It reduces the market price of solar tariffs well past the average charged by India’s largest thermal coal conglomerate, currently around 3.20 rupees per kWh . Wholesale price bids for wind energy also reached a record low of 3.46 rupees in February. Kanika Chawla, a senior programme lead at the Delhi-based Council for Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), said it was encouraging that Rajasthan project bidders were “new players, not the same old market leaders”. “It shows there is enough happening to attract investment, attract interest from companies who have otherwise been cautious,” she said. Prices were likely to drop further if the cost of borrowing money continued to fall – which she said was one of the major drivers in the record low prices this year. “Any future incremental gains in prices will not come from the decline in technology prices, they will come from declines in the cost of finance,” she said. Investors were also likely encouraged by a recent move to allow the state-backed Solar Energy Corporation of India to act as a guarantor in agreements between energy developers and India’s debt-ridden power distribution companies. Tim Buckley, a director at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the most important factor driving a rush of international investment in Indian renewables was the “transparency, longevity and certainty” of the country’s energy policy. “That is absolutely critical because when you invest for 25 to 35 years, you need certainty and clarity of policy,” he said. “India has prime minister [Narendra] Modi saying this is his number one objective, you have energy minister [Piyush] Goyal talking about it every day. There is no doubt in anyone’s mind about Goyal’s commitment to this program and Modi’s endorsement of what Goyal’s doing,” he said. By 2022, India aims to have the capacity to generate 175 gigawatts of power from solar, biomass and wind energy. A draft report by the country’s electricity agency in December predicted that capacity would increase to 275 gigawatts by 2027. The same draft report said it was unlikely India would need any new coal power stations for at least 10 years, beyond the 50 gigawatts of projects already in the pipeline. Chawla said the successive drops in renewable prices “should be celebrated” but cautioned that systemic reforms were still needed to make the trend sustainable. Renewable energy projects also still enjoyed exemptions from some taxes that fossil fuel-generators had to pay, she added. “We need to run the numbers before we can say [unsubsidised solar] is cheaper than coal, but it’s definitely competitive,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2020/apr/04/i-live-alone-on-a-boat-at-sea-how-to-be-happy-in-isolation","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-04T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"‘I live alone at sea.

Here's how to be happy in isolation’","bodyText":"‘I want to reassure people,” I announced grandly on Instagram the other day, “that it’s easier to change behaviour than you think.” With anxious friends facing a massive change of life in the face of coronavirus, I wanted to spread some calm. The reason I’d started dispensing “wisdom” like some nautical soothsayer was that I gave up a much-loved job at the Guardian three years ago to pursue a simpler life on my tiny sailboat. I ended up crossing the Channel to France, sailing down the Atlantic coast to Portugal, into the Mediterranean, through Spain and Italy to Greece. It’s the slowest life imaginable, travelling at walking pace, completely immersed in nature. I sleep freely in secluded bays, by white beaches, fish and octopus swimming below me. I’ve sailed with dolphins and whales, woken to horses galloping on deserted beaches in southern Italy, and anchored by castles and cathedral-like cliffs. It is magical and it is nourishing. The downside is that I have few home comforts (no fridge in 40C heat is challenging), very little money, and I spend a lot of time alone - sometimes at sea for weeks. I have become my own living proof that you need very little to be extremely happy. Sailors, I thought, are uniquely placed to weather this storm. In that spirit, I sat down to prescribe advice on how to cope with isolation, feeling calm and strong about my decision to sit out this pandemic in Greece. I had been writing for just five minutes when the expected lockdown was announced. With relatively few cases reported, Greece is acting fast – its fragile economy and healthcare systems will be hit hard. Ten minutes later I was sobbing. I called my friend Cat. “I’ve been expecting this,” she said, in the tone of someone who really knows you. Next, I drank a whole bottle of wine while scrolling through my laptop, crying at the kindness of people far away. Not the font of wisdom I’d hoped to be. But I was right – we humans are incredibly resourceful and we do adapt. Fear and its symptoms – panic and anxiety – are normal responses to danger and uncertainty. In my travels, fear has kept me safe and I’ve learned to rely on gut instinct – acting quickly to change plans when ominous clouds signal an oncoming storm, or staying alert through hours of fatigue in thick fog off Spain’s rocky Galician coast. The fear beforehand is always the worst bit – once we’re in crisis, we cope, recover and learn. Those who have experienced grief will remember this feeling of waking up already in the knowledge that something big is wrong. But pay attention – this is an extraordinary time. Normality is suspended; life has slowed. We are alert. We see clearly what’s important and we disregard irrelevance. There is much to despair over, but we will also surprise ourselves at what we can face, with grace, courage, humour – with each other. I’ve had my most memorable times in splendid isolation, spending days in childlike wonder exploring Cala Magraner in Mallorca, my only company wheeling gulls and goats climbing vertiginous cliffs. But not all isolation is welcome – or chosen – and even solo sailors are social creatures. After too long alone last winter, I sailed to the Sardinian city of Olbia and turned to that old-school travel platform Couchsurfer, effectively asking people to be my friend. “I don’t need a bed,” I messaged strangers, “but fancy a coffee?” I made amazing friends – and learned a lesson in setting pride aside to admit you’re lonely. However independent you are, emotional support is vital when you’re far from loved ones. I’m now better at getting that support – creating WhatsApp groups to check in with friends, share the positives, talk through the scarier stuff. If you reach out, there will always be someone to pick you up when your inevitable meltdown comes. And you will do the same for them. During my recent panic, friends simply reminded me that it’s OK to feel bad. I’m calling my dad daily. He’s strong, positive, brilliant. But he’s 81, so I listen to his phone ringing out, my internal monologue screaming “WHERE IS HE?” before he finally picks up: “I was in the garden. Not dead.” Sailors are good at connecting fast and helping each other because we know what it is to be in trouble at sea. Our shared lifestyle means we’re used to being friendly without crowding each other’s limited space. When I seek shelter from storms, I look for the safest place and hope there are other boats – not too many, and not close enough to collide – for the comfort of similar-minded people nearby. Storms at anchor are marked by small gestures from others – the guy in Falmouth who raised a glass from his cockpit as I waved at him in a howling gale; the time on the island of Vulcano , north of Sicily, when a neighbour, sensing my anxiety as we veered in 60mph winds, messaged approval of my anchor’s set, unspoken reassurance that I wouldn’t drag off to sea. Right now I’m finding joy in the cheerful whistling of my friendly Dutch neighbour and the eggs from his happy hens that a French sailing friend left. There is enormous comfort from the smallest human contact. Never underestimate it. The challenge of isolation in bad weather is boredom, particularly when your inside space is less than six square metres. But overriding that is the relief that you’re safe. Living at sea, you take risk seriously (a neighbour in Portugal was lost overboard in high winds). Should you forget this, popping your head out of the hatch is can remind you that boredom is a welcome problem. It never fails to surprise me how quiet it is inside when I return from the chaos of wind screeching and thunder cracking. You learn to appreciate your home even more making it cosy – being grateful for its sanctuary when there’s a threat outside. You are aware of how precious life is on a regular basis. Simple daily rhythms bring enormous comfort. During 10 days of storm in Villasimius, Sardinia, Radio 4’s Book at Bedtime happened to be Jaws. Perfect! There’s the day’s first cup of tea; appreciating the light at sunset; waiting for the plough to appear in the sky; a good dinner. I find cooking therapeutic. But when the boat is leaping about in a storm, and your home is liable to fling kitchen knives at your head, it’s best, I’ve learned, to stick to store-cupboard soups and stews. This won’t be popular advice, or easy, but try to limit internet use. Technical things can go wrong. (For the same reason, I never totally rely on my engine at sea, because bitter experience has taught me it will cut out just as I’m pushed towards some hazard: in Brittany’s notorious Chenal du Four, and again while racing an oncoming storm to Elba’s safe harbour in the Tuscan archipelago). Too much screen time is bad for us anyway, and if we collectively crash the internet through overuse or become vulnerable to viruses (not that one), we are going to be bereft. A reliance on solar power and a cap on data means I use it sparingly – brilliant journalism to inform, social media to connect, music to lift my spirits, but increasingly I’m turning to nourishing things that can’t fail – books, cloudspotting, writing, growing herbs. And exercise – if I can manage some stretching positions in the 2x1 metres of flat space I have, anyone can. It occurred to me yesterday that I could use a mooring line to do some skipping on the harbour wall here at Pylos. In theory. I’m wondering, too, whether a swim around the boat breaks the lockdown. Think I’ll risk it. When your world slows down, food becomes a huge part of your day. And as shopping trips are limited, it’s important to choose fresh stuff that lasts. I’ve learned what keeps best without a fridge – cabbage, aubergines, courgettes, yoghurt, eggs (turn them regularly) – and don’t waste a thing (I avoid carrots and broccoli as they deteriorate surprisingly quickly). I make sure I have a breakfast I love – pancakes or porridge with fruit compote. Toast (currently running low on Marmite, sob!). As favourite things become difficult to get, I adapt. In Italy I missed Greek yoghurt, then realised how simple it is to make. Likewise butter. Finding myself with a load of fish in the little fishing village of Culatra, in Portugal, I learned to fillet and salt them – new skills, and protein for weeks. At sea 20 nautical miles from the nearest shop in Menorca and craving bread, I started making flatbreads in a frying pan. I’m currently wondering if I could somehow bake a rudimentary loaf in my lidded barbecue (my first Christmas on board, it roasted a whole chicken and potatoes). I’m also pondering either a barbecue or frying-pan cake. It must be possible, right? If there’s ever been a time for experimentation, it is now. Play with food, have fun with it – but don’t waste it, obviously. Things will be tight for many of us newly without income. Without trivialising the seriousness of this, I can at least report that it is extraordinarily satisfying to reduce spending, to break addiction to consumption. I keep a geeky diary of how little I spend day to day (£60 a week on average): writing it down brings more pleasure than spending it. And there is now time to fix things. Repairing rather than replacing is so rewarding – working with a small budget forces us to be greener and I feel happier as a result. I’ve never been practical (understatement – I once used a rag to replace a mislaid oil cap in my car and seized the engine), so learning to service my boat engine has been surprisingly satisfying. The pleasure I got from rowing to an empty little cove in Pylos harbour the other day, after spending three days fixing my dinghy, was a high. I think all proper sailors have repaired their toilet. Once you’ve done that, you can tackle anything. Coping in storms and fixing things are two of the things that have amazed me about myself. The strangest thing for sailors, so used to freedom, is to be trapped – boats shouldn’t be in a harbour in good weather, and we itch to leave. The sacrifice of living in a small space and the effort of maintaining this lifestyle are the price we pay for that freedom. Now that freedom is curtailed – but it must be. We have the reserves to adapt and find happiness. I’m focusing on the beauty of the natural world immediately around me: the birds that fly around the harbour at sunset, the fish nibbling the quay, the crabs scuttling below. I’m taking enormous comfort from the fact that whatever else we’ve done to them, other species appear to be largely untouched by this thing. The natural world is getting much-needed respite from our reduction in activity and pollution levels. And most importantly, people are noticing, and sharing joy about that. We are becoming aware that this is a chance for real change, and that is the biggest positive of all. When this is over, so too will be the narrative that we can’t change our systems, our society, ourselves. Let’s use this time wisely – the planet urgently needs change, and so do we."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2019/sep/15/labour-tax-on-city-deals-would-be-a-big-vote-winner","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-15T11:06:06Z","webTitle":"Labour's tax on City deals would be a big vote winner | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/15/labour-tax-on-city-deals-would-be-a-big-vote-winner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2019/sep/15/labour-tax-on-city-deals-would-be-a-big-vote-winner","fields":{"headline":"Labour's tax on City deals would be a big vote winner","bodyText":"A comprehensive tax on financial transactions once seemed like a pipe dream but is now only a few months and a general election away. When asked at an event last week if he would support a new plan that would raise an estimated £7bn a year for the exchequer, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, had a one-word answer: yes. The proposals were unchallengeable, he said. That’s not true, obviously. Labour’s plans for a financial transaction tax (FTT) were being challenged even as McDonnell spoke. The City has enormous lobbying power and the machine was quickly cranked into gear. The financial sector employs a million people, paid £75bn in tax last year and provides essential products such as pensions, mortgages and insurance, said Stephen Jones, the chief executive of UK Finance, the trade body for the financial sector. “This proposed FTT is a tax on growth that will ultimately hit savers, homeowners and SMEs.” However, McDonnell’s support for an FTT is longstanding. He used to urge Gordon Brown to introduce one in his days as chancellor, to no avail. The plan now being supported is a more ambitious version of the FTT proposal included in the 2017 manifesto. In the event of Labour winning the election, this will be one occasion when City lobbying falls on deaf ears. Britain already has a financial transaction tax: the stamp duty paid when shares listed on the London Stock Exchange are traded. It is a nice little earner for the government, raking in £3.5bn in 2017-18, and one of the hardest of all taxes to avoid paying. The FTT McDonnell is supporting would cover a wider range of assets. Opposition to the FTT is based on the principle that it would make markets less efficient. When in the 1970s the economist James Tobin came up with the idea of a tax on foreign exchange dealing, he talked about throwing sand in the wheels of the financial system. To market fundamentalists, this has to be a bad idea. However, the real test of markets is not whether they are pure and efficient but whether they are effective. Financial markets have a pretty basic function: to take savings and turn them into productive investment in a way that keeps costs to consumers low and makes the economy safer and more sustainable. As currently constituted, the UK financial system does the opposite of all that. Over recent decades there has been an explosion of short-term trading, some of which – the hedging of foreign currency risk, for example – can be beneficial but most of which falls into the category of shuffling bits of paper around. The churning of assets has made plenty of people in the City extremely rich but has not led to any discernible benefits for the non-financial sector of the economy. The cost of raising finance is the same as it was in the late 19th century; all the gains from technology and economies of scale have been grabbed by producers rather than consumers. As the crash of 2008 showed, the arrival of “fast finance”, with all the herd-like behaviour that involved, did not make the financial system safer; it made it more vulnerable. And the UK has the lowest investment rate of any country in the G7 group of industrial nations. McDonnell nailed it when he asked: “Why is it that we have such a large finance sector and yet are starved of long-term finance?” Well, one reason is that transactions by long-term investors such as pension funds and insurance companies once represented more than 70% of turnover on the London Stock Exchange. Now it is 40%. More churn has meant more short-termism. FTTs are a modest antidote to that because they are fees – levied at a fraction of 1% – on each and every transaction. In the plan McDonnell is proposing, a financial firm would pay 0.01% for each interest-rate derivatives transaction. The idea is to raise the cost of short-term churning relative to holding assets for longer. But wouldn’t an FTT be avoided? Wouldn’t all those hedge funds merely do their business in New York or Zurich? It seems unlikely because Labour’s FTT plan includes a residence principle. Tax liability depends on the beneficial owner of an asset following purchase being a UK resident. So moving the transactions offshore would not allow individuals to avoid the tax. To do so, they would have to stop residing in the UK and the proposed tax rates are almost certainly too low to provide an incentive to do that. What’s more, some of the transactions that would be covered by McDonnell’s plan are already subject to an FTT in other jurisdictions, including Switzerland and the US. The City is also suffering from cognitive dissonance. Memories of the financial crisis are long and bitter. According to opinion polls, a majority for every party thinks the City does not contribute sufficiently to the wider UK economy. Fewer than one in six voters think the financial sector could not afford to pay more tax. Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the finance minister to Louis XIV, once said: “The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to procure the largest quantity of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing” – a comment that sums up McDonnell’s approach to an FTT. The shadow chancellor mentioned last week some of the things that Labour could do with the £35bn that an FTT could raise in the course of a five-year parliament: putting it towards retrofitting homes, so that they are carbon neutral, or on a major expansion of wind and solar power. The public will like that. Outside of the City, there won’t be a lot of hissing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/sep/08/australian-politics-live-anthony-albanese-jim-chalmers-economy-climate-bill-adam-bandt-cost-of-living-jobs-skills-industry-weather-covid-nsw-victoria-queensland","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T08:29:39Z","webTitle":"Lidia Thorpe criticises Indigenous voice working group – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/sep/08/australian-politics-live-anthony-albanese-jim-chalmers-economy-climate-bill-adam-bandt-cost-of-living-jobs-skills-industry-weather-covid-nsw-victoria-queensland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/sep/08/australian-politics-live-anthony-albanese-jim-chalmers-economy-climate-bill-adam-bandt-cost-of-living-jobs-skills-industry-weather-covid-nsw-victoria-queensland","fields":{"headline":"Lidia Thorpe criticises Indigenous voice working group – as it happened","bodyText":"We will wrap up the blog here at the end of the first sitting week of this fortnight period in what has turned out to be a busy last sitting day. Here’s what made the news today: The new Labor government’s signature climate change bill enshrining a 43% emissions reduction target by 2030 has passed the parliament, with government MPs hailing the passage of the bill as the end of the climate wars. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, was accused by the Coalition of breaching the ministerial code of conduct over holding shares in his self-managed superfund in a fund that is a major shareholder in a company involved in litigation financing. The Coalition has raised questions about whether it represents a conflict of interest. Dreyfus has denied any wrongdoing but said he would examine the matter. The RBA has said it will need to lift interest rates at least twice more to curb inflation. Governor Philip Lowe has said he has no intentions of resigning, despite calls for him to go. Masks will no longer be mandatory on international flights from tomorrow, in line with changes coming into effect on domestic flights. From tomorrow Covid cases and deaths will be reported weekly. There were at least 74 reported Covid-19 deaths reported on Thursday. Baggage handlers have called off a planned strike for Monday. Infrastructure minister Catherine King will introduce legislation to establish a High Speed Rail Authority. My colleague Natasha May will be back with you tomorrow morning, while I’ll have the Friday afternoon slog. Until then. Australians urged to get Covid vaccine booster ahead of spring sports events The nearly one in three Australians who have not had a Covid-19 vaccine booster are being urged to do so before footy finals and the spring racing carnival. It’s particularly important to be protected from severe disease as changes to mask rules and isolation come into effect on Friday, according to a leading vaccine advocacy group. Immunisation Coalition CEO Kim Sampson says he wants vaccine-complacent Australians to be jolted out of thinking the pandemic is over. “As we head into the footy finals, with large crowds of fans from across the country travelling and gathering, it’s important Australians don’t delay protecting themselves and their loved ones by being fully vaccinated,” Sampson said. Just over 71% of Australians aged 16 and over have had three or more jabs. There’s also concern that less than 60% of school-aged children are immunised against Covid-19. There have been nine reported Covid-19 deaths in children under five. Immunisation Coalition Board member Professor Robert Booy is urging parents to make sure their children are protected. “Covid-19 disease has been described as a generation-defining disruption to children who have been forced to forego large amounts of their education,” he said. “Vaccines are available for high-risk children between the ages of six months and five years and are more widely available for school children in general.” The push comes as states and territories agree to stop releasing daily Covid-19 case figures from Friday. The federal government will instead issue weekly data on new cases, deaths, hospitalisations and ICU admissions. There were more than 10,000 new cases of Covid-19 and 62 deaths reported across Australia on Wednesday. Labor MPs revel in passing of climate change bill Perhaps slightly premature to declare the climate wars over, but Labor MPs are taking a victory lap on social media. Flood warning for parts of Victoria Greens bid to protect South Australian wombat burrows Legislation to help stop wombats being buried alive has been introduced to the South Australian parliament after incidents of burrows being bulldozed, AAP reports. Greens MP Tammy Franks said while wombats were a protected species in SA, their burrows were often filled in during farming or construction work, dooming the wombats inside to a slow and horrific death. She said in one incident captured on video in 2021, police and environment department officials said they could not take action because there was no explicit evidence of animals being injured. “Burying a wombat in a burrow is a slow death sentence for the animal. They slowly suffocate and starve, a process which can take as long as three weeks,” Franks said. “Across South Australia wombats are still being buried alive as a form of eradication day in and day out with little action or recourse, in stark contradiction to the intent of our current laws aimed at protecting them.” Under the Greens’ bill it will be an offence to destroy, damage or disturb a wombat burrow with maximum penalties of a $5,000 fine or imprisonment for 12 months. Wombat Awareness Organisation spokeswoman Brigitte Stevens said protecting wombat burrows by law was long overdue. “The lives of thousands of animals would be spared from the horrors of being buried alive,” she said. Here’s my colleague Adam Morton’s full report on the passage of the government’s signature climate change legislation through the parliament today. NSW corruption watchdog at capacity: chief The NSW anti-corruption commission is receiving 50 to 70 referrals every week and the watchdog’s chief warns it is unable to take on further investigations, AAP reports. Despite an 11% funding boost for the commission in the June budget, the agency says it has reached a full workload after years of prior cuts. “At the moment, and I’ve made this point to the premier as well, the commission does not have spare capacity,” Icac chief commissioner John Hatzistergos told a budget estimates hearing on Wednesday. “If the parliament was to pass a resolution asking the Icac to take on an investigation, the only way we could do that is by taking people away from current projects.” The former district court judge and attorney general said his commission has seven preliminary investigations and four full investigations afoot. Those include the inquiry that led Gladys Berejiklian to resign as premier in 2020 when she was compelled to admit she’d been in a relationship with her parliamentary secretary, Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire. Icac is also investigating alleged corruption at two Sydney councils and the roads authority. The commission fielded a record 3,570 referrals in the year to June, an average of 9.8 a day. This financial year is similarly high, sitting at 557 two months in. Hatzistergos said the $3.5m funding boost in the June state budget would allow for 17 new full-time equivalent positions. But the recruitment and vetting required for people working for Icac meant it was still suffering from cuts in 2016. “Letting people go is relatively easy. Putting people on takes time,” Hatzistergos said. His predecessor had called for Icac to be funded by the parliament, not the executive government. The government instead agreed to separate funding for commissions such as Icac and the Auditor-General through a separate unit of Treasury, which will develop a charter of independence. Efficiency dividends – forcing agencies to find savings each year – will no longer apply. Labor says it will legislate to guarantee independent funding for Icac, if elected in March. “A strong and independently funded Icac is critical to restoring public faith and confidence in government,” opposition special minister of state spokesman John Graham said on Thursday. AAP has a story on what one of the new features in the new iPhone could mean for people in regional and remote parts of Australia. Apple launched its new iPhone series on Thursday with a range of new capabilities. One key feature will allow users to send text messages to emergency services using satellites in the absence of a cellular or wifi connection. Deb Charlton from NSW Farmers said the new feature would put safety in more pockets once it becomes available down under. “For a great big land like Australia, being able to call for help when you’re out of coo-ee will be a game changer,” Charlton said. “While this won’t help us deal with the issue of data connectivity or being able to run your business from the paddock, this promises to be a major step forward for safety.” In some instances, users will also be able to share their location via satellite when they have no other connectivity. The new Apple feature will be free for the first two years before users will have to pay. The latest features will initially be rolled out across Canada and the United States before being expanded to other parts of the world including Australia in coming months. On that note, I shall leave you in the very safe hands of Josh Taylor for the evening. If the week seemed a lot, don’t worry – we’ll wrap the parliament week in a quick video for you, which you can watch on Saturday. Until then, keep checking back on the site for all the updates and in-depth coverage from Sarah Martin, Josh Butler and Paul Karp as well as the entire Guardian brains trust. A huge thank you to them all for their tireless work, not only being across everything, but also dragging me across the line. And to Mike Bowers – all of the thank yous, from all of us, because without him, there is no Politics Live. The moderators have also worked overtime to keep comments open for as long as possible – which means we have all been able to have a good old chat. Big thanks to them. But the biggest thank you, as always, belongs to you, for all of your support. We couldn’t do it without you. I’ll be back on the blog from Monday with the next sitting week (it will be a general news blog tomorrow, given the parliament is adjourned) so I hope to see you there. Until then, please – take care of you. Federal parliament wraps up for the week There was very little fanfare at the end of that vote. The house is now going through the adjournment debate. And the MPs are starting to leave for the airport. And that looks like it. The amended legislation has passed the house. Australia (almost, royal assent first) has a legislated climate target. The first vote on the first lot of amendments ends with the ayes winning (as expected). Ayes 86 to Noes 50. We are now moving on to the next amendment vote, and another division. House of Representatives votes on climate bill amendments The house is now voting on the Senate amendments to the climate bill – it will pass. The division is a way of showing who voted against it. The Greens senator Lidia Thorpe has also had a crack at the government’s appointment of a new working group of First Nations leaders to “guide the big questions” about a referendum to enshrine a voice to parliament in the constitution which was announced by the minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney on Thursday. The Victorian senator said from what she had seen of the list – which includes Noel Pearson, Megan Davis, Pat Anderson, Marcia Langton and Tom Calma – they were “captain’s picks” who did not represent First Nations voices. Thorpe, a Djab Wurrung, Gunnai and Gunditjmara woman, said: I mean, we want to talk about grassroots. I don’t see anyone different in the list that I’ve seen so far, so they haven’t gone very far and wide. There’s a lot of work to do and grassroots people have been contacting me since the announcement – they’re not happy and they need to do better. We need to define who Aboriginal leaders are in this country, because it’s very easy to label one, and we also need to define who grassroots are in this country. Grassroots don’t have big-paying jobs; they’re not CEOs or chairpersons of organisations; grassroots are the people who you never hear from and they’re the people that should be behind the microphone today. Thorpe, who is a strong proponent for establishing a treaty before looking at constitutional recognition, said that while she had been “locked out of the conversation” with the government, she would soon have a meeting with Burney to discuss “truth, treaty and voice”. Mike Bowers went to Sussan Ley’s press conference on Labor ministers’ shareholdings and says it was more of the same “no integrity on integrity” with a dash of “is it about to rain?” (the answer to that last one is yes). Climate bill amendments come before House of Representatives The climate bill is back in front of the house, where the opposition is arguing against it. Ted O’Brien is very upset over a lack of modelling. The amended bill will come to a vote very soon. The Senate has offered up some truly special contributions today. Lidia Thorpe and Larissa Waters sum up the vibe in this photo from Mike Bowers. We will bring you what we can from Sussan Ley’s press conference – it is not being shown as yet, but we are on it. Australia’s chief medical officer says masks no longer need to be worn on international flights, as of tomorrow. From the statement: The requirement to wear a mask on international flights to Australia will be removed, effective 12.01am on Friday 9 September 2022. This is based on advice from the Chief Medical Officer and is consistent with the decision of National Cabinet on 31 August 2022 on domestic flights. We encourage travellers to consider wearing a mask to reduce their personal risk of contracting and spreading Covid-19. Travellers should also be aware that airlines and countries they are travelling through may have different requirements. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, is the latest government member to become embroiled in a widening furore over investments held by ministers, with the Coalition claiming the financial arrangements of several frontbenchers breach Anthony Albanese’s ministerial standards. The attorney general denied any wrongdoing but said he would “examine the matter”. Dreyfus’s register of interests shows his self-managed superannuation fund holds shares in the Greencape Wholesale Broadcap Fund, which in turn is a major shareholder in Omni Bridgeway Limited, which bills itself as “the global leader in litigation financing and managing legal risk”. With Dreyfus as the nation’s first law officer, the opposition has raised questions about whether this represents a conflict of interest. The opposition has been trawling through the register of interests after ministers Kristy McBain, Bill Shorten, Tim Ayres and Ged Kearney disclosed they had shareholdings in some form – which the Coalition claims may breach the ministerial code, which requires that “Ministers divest themselves of investments and other interests in any public or private company or business, other than public superannuation funds or publicly listed managed funds or trust arrangements”. In question time today, the deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley asked Dreyfus about his arrangements. Dreyfus said he would “examine the matter that has been raised”: I can assure the honourable member and assure members of this house that I have complied at all times with the code of conduct for ministers. It’s a very significant matter, that’s why I’ve undertaken to look at the matter that’s been raised. Every single one of the publicly listed managed funds that my private superannuation fund invests in have been fully disclosed to this house. Dreyfus said that in all his publicly listed financial arrangements, he had “no influence over investment decisions of that fund or trust”. Ley is to hold a press conference in Canberra at 3.45pm, so we expect to hear more from her on this. Here is how some of that event looked: Labor promises to cut red tape for people trying to access assistance animals Bill Shorten held a press conference with some puppies from Vision Australia to draw attention to some of the changes needed with groups like Vision Australia: Even the most seasoned political cynics will be surprised at some of the red tape we’ve uncovered since coming to government, with how difficult the previous government made it accessing assistance animals. For example, the previous government had guidelines that said the average working life of a guide dog is 8 years. The problem is the average working life of a guide dog is somewhere nearer to 6 years. So what the old government used to say is that if your dog, who might have died of cancer, who could no longer do the work, had done less than 8 years, the person with vision impairment would be required to pay the shortfall up to 8 years. I kid you not. Another example we’ve discovered upon coming to government is that whilst assistance animals empower people’s lives, we’ve found that people who had an assistance animal have been told by the National Disability Insurance Agency that they weren’t eligible for taxi concessions. Now the point about this is that whilst an assistance animal helps you, sometimes you need to get a taxi. Not every meeting, not every aspect of your life is within walking distance. So literally we’ve seen some of the [most bizarre] forms of red tape. I don’t know if the old political government even knew these rules existed that they were administering. The other thing we intend to resolve is that organisations such as Vision Australia Seeing Eye Dogs or Guide Dogs for the Blind – they are the most experienced dog trainers in the world. Not every vision-impaired person needs a guide dog or is suitable for a guide dog. But if Guide Dogs Australia or Vision Australia Seeing Eye Dogs, if they do a rigorous assessment, if they say this vision-impaired person is suitable for the animal and they’ve got an animal available, what we found is that the old government would then take the person that wanted the dog and the assessment done by these reputable agencies and take them to court and argue about it. My view is that, and I’ve looked since coming to government, if the government had a secret unit of dog trainers who were skilled in assessing the work of Seeing Eye Dogs and Guide Dogs Victoria etc. So far I haven’t found that unit. So what we want to do as a government is get out of the way of the people that have been doing this for decades. Not everyone needs, or is suitable for, a guide dog. I don’t think if we decrease the red tape all of a sudden there will be thousands of guide dogs in every street in Australia. The government is here to help people. The NDIS should be helping people. So that’s what I mean by cutting out some of the red tape. Literally, it is some of the most bizarre rules that not even Shaun Micallef could invent these rules. Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 74 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 179 In hospital: 87 (with 1 person in ICU) NSW Deaths: 25 Cases: 3,334 In hospital: 1,530 (with 29 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 0 Cases: 89 In hospital: 15 (with 1 person in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 11 Cases: 1,564 In hospital: 225 (with 3 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 2 Cases: 654 In hospital: 83 (with 7 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 0 Cases: 166 In hospital: 24 (with 1 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 24 Cases: 2,102 In hospital: 227 (with 15 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 12 Cases: 1,088 In hospital: 201 (with 7 people in ICU) Coalition calls press conference on Labor ministers’ shareholdings Sussan Ley has called a press conference for 3.45pm. She will be speaking on the Coalition’s allegations that three of Labor’s ministers have breached the ministerial code of conduct over their shareholdings. Josh Butler will be summarising that for you, as my brain is bleeding out of my ears at this stage of the sitting. Government looking at other grants after funding scrapped for foundation backed by governor general Monique Ryan wants to know if the government will review other discretionary grants given to organisations and charities in light of the scrapping of the $18m in funding for the leadership foundation backed by the governor general. Anthony Albanese says yes, that is something the government is looking at. Question time resumes after Dutton motion fails Annnnnd the division ends as expected, with Labor winning. Question time resumes. OK, now we are going to a division on that suspension motion, which Labor will win (by that there will be no suspension). Climate bill gives business greater clarity, Australian Energy Council says Meanwhile, the Australian Energy Council has also welcomed the passage of the climate legislation through the Senate: The peak body for energy retailers and generators, the Australian Energy Council, congratulated the Federal Government on the passage of the Climate Bill through the Senate and welcomed the foundation it will provide for economy-wide emissions reduction policies. The AEC’s Chief Executive, Sarah McNamara, said the AEC wholeheartedly supports the Government’s commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 and the need for well-considered interim targets to assist its achievement. “Enshrining a policy in legislation gives businesses and industry greater clarity. For sectors like electricity, which are already deeply invested in Australia’s decarbonisation journey, policy confidence is critical to the sector’s orderly transition. We look forward to the amended Bill being passed by the House of Representatives in due course. “Achieving 43 per cent emission reductions by 2030 requires sectors other than electricity to begin their decarbonisation journey this decade. Promisingly, there are immediate and affordable ways to start decarbonising sectors such as Australia’s transport and stationary energy sectors through the uptake of electrification technology.” The AEC has proposed an interim economy-wide emissions reduction target of 55 per cent on 2005 levels by 2035. MP share revelations come from work of non-partisan Open Politics A lot of these revelations have come from the work of Open Politics, which is run by the former ministerial staffer Sean Johnson. It is not a partisan site and is looking at the private interests of all MPs. Tony Burke lists shares owned by shadow ministers as he speaks against Dutton motion “OK everyone, wake up,” says Tony Burke, who is now speaking against the motion by listing the shares that the shadow ministry has, including the shadow minister for climate change having shares in Rio Tinto. Labor has no integrity on integrity, Julian Leeser says as he seconds Dutton motion Julian Leeser is seconding Peter Dutton’s motion, speaking on the theme “Labor has no integrity on integrity”. He is also being granted time to speak. Labor has the numbers, so the debate won’t happen unless it wants it to (which it doesn’t) but it is notable that the speeches are allowed to happen. There is a lot of chatter from the opposition benches as Leeser makes his way through his speech. Here is how the climate legislation vote played out: Peter Dutton is getting a whole speech in for this suspension motion, which is very against trend for these sorts of things. Liberal Hollie Hughes grills Labor’s Murray Watt on childcare subsidies In the 47th parliament Labor’s ministry is heavily loaded towards the lower house. It’s caused quite a workload for the ministers in the Senate who have to represent their lower house colleagues in question time. All week, the Coalition has been targeting upper house ministers with questions in the portfolios of their lower house colleagues. For example, today Liberal Hollie Hughes is grilling Murray Watt not about his portfolios of agriculture or emergency management but about childcare, with questions about subsidy increases at various income points ($60K, $400K etc). Watt takes them on notice adding: I’m sure you’re posing that question to the actual minister – if that’s not occurring she should talk to her colleagues. This provoked cries of “not your job, Murray?” recalling Labor’s ads attacking Scott Morrison with his own dictum “not my job”. Labor is letting Peter Dutton speak on this suspension (which is something the Coalition very rarely let happen). He says Labor promised to “usher in a new era” and “none of that has happened”. Leave is not granted by Labor (which was a favourite of the Coalition government). There is a bit of argy-bargy over whether Peter Dutton is moving the right motion (to suspend standing orders) using the right terms, but we are back on track now. Tony Burke has been able to play his favourite game, “who knows the standing orders best”, twice so far this question time. He seems to very much enjoy it (because most times, he wins). Peter Dutton moves to suspend standing orders for first time And now Peter Dutton is moving a motion to suspend standing orders – his first for question time, and an old Labor tactic. It’s on transparency – and how the LNP thinks three Labor ministers have breached the ministerial code by having shares (or divested) which is against the code. Because all technology apparently hates me, the Otter transcription service is struggling to keep up with question time, so I am going to have to track down the hansard to bring you this. It is all over the place. Grassroots NT Labor party members at odds with government on fracking There was an interesting development out of the Northern Territory Labor party conference on the weekend. The party’s grassroots base voted overwhelmingly in favour of passing a string of motions calling for the banning of fracking in the NT. That’s a position that is at odds with both the Labor territory and federal governments, which both support opening up the vast Beetaloo Basin for gas development. Motions put forward during NT Labor’s conference on Saturday included calls for an “immediate ban” to fracking in the NT, a halt to exploration in the Beetaloo Basin, and an end to government subsidies supporting the gas industry. One motion, moved by Young Labor, called for an acknowledgement that the progress of the Beetaloo project was an “indictment of the Territory Labor Party’s morals and is a direct result of capitalistic greed”. Another motion, moved by the Casuarina branch, said that increasing emissions by developing more fossil fuel deposits, including in the Beetaloo and the Barossa offshore gas fields, was “incompatible with sustaining life as we know it in the NT, Australia and globally”. Other motions called for the development of a 2030 carbon emissions reduction target and implementation plan, and urged the government to heed a recommendation of the landmark Pepper inquiry into fracking by ensuring no net increase in greenhouse gas emissions occurred. All of the anti-fracking motions were passed with very little opposition, according to multiple sources. Climate bill must serve as springboard for more action, Climate Council says From the Climate Council: Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie says: “It’s time to crack on, as the climate crisis is upon us. “This Act is important because it demonstrates that the majority of our Parliamentarians understand that climate action is a shared and urgent responsibility,” Ms McKenzie said. Australia’s politicians are finally working together. Voters made it clear that they want to see progress, and we thank members of the ALP, the Greens and the Independents in both houses of Parliament for working together so constructively to pass this Bill. For the first time ever Australia has clear, minimum climate targets enshrined in law. This will help encourage the massive private investment we need to transform our economy to net zero. On its own, the Climate Change Act won’t reduce emissions – so the law should serve as a springboard for more action. It needs to be backed up by credible climate action across every sector of the economy, so we can build on this; going much further and faster this decade. The 2020s are the make or break decade for keeping global warming to survivable limits. Everything is at stake if we get this wrong. Australia no longer ‘a laggard and a laughing stock’, ACF says All the statements are now starting to roll in. From the Australian Conservation Foundation’s climate program manager, Gavan McFadzean: It is heartening to see Australia’s legislators finally taking the climate crisis seriously. For too long Australia has been a laggard and a laughing stock. This is no longer the case. ACF commends parliamentarians – in the House of Representatives and the Senate – who have strengthened this bill on its passage through the parliament. Amendments to this legislation, introduced by Senator David Pocock and supported by a majority of Senators, have improved the transparency of this bill. It’s good to see parliamentarians working together for stronger action on climate change. Climate bill goes back to House of Representatives where it is set to pass The climate bill now goes back to the house to have the amendments from David Pocock voted on, but it will pass there as well. Which means it will be sent off for royal assent and then once granted, Australia will have a legislated emissions reduction target. Symbolic, yes, but given what has happened over the last decade, still important. Government says climate bill will provide ‘certainty needed to usher in economic growth’ And some very quick staffer in the PMO already has a statement out on it: The Albanese Government’s landmark Climate Change Bills have now passed the Senate, ensuring Australia’s emissions reduction target of 43 per cent and net zero emissions by 2050 will be enshrined in legislation. For almost a decade, Australia stumbled from one policy to another, and our economy and communities missed out on billions of dollars in public and private clean energy investment. But today that changes. This overdue legislation will provide the energy policy and investment certainty needed to usher in economic growth and opportunity in a decarbonising global economy. The Bills ensure a whole-of-government approach to drive down emissions and accountability through an annual update to Parliament. It is a done deal in the upper house. The climate bill legislating a 43% emissions reduction target has passed 37 votes to 30. Paul Fletcher’s voice sounds like it left his throat and had a roaring great time in a smoky Vegas pokie room until 4am and then went and rolled around in gravel for good measure before returning for a day’s work. We hope the manager of opposition business feels better soon. Anthony Albanese faces questions about Labor ministers’ shareholdings We have had three questions about Labor ministers/assistant ministers who had interests in shares which is against the Albanese code of conduct. Anthony Albanese says all has been addressed. OK, now we are all caught up, it seems that the Tveeder transcription service has given up the ghost and is not working. So we will have to paraphrase a bit because it moves too quickly for me to transcribe in near-live time. Mike Bowers is in the Senate capturing the climate bill vote. I have no plans to resign, RBA governor says after ‘Lowe must go’ calls The RBA governor, Philip Lowe, has addressed a few questions from the media about whether he had broken a promise about when the bank would lift interest rates. Among them, he was asked about the “unity ticket” between the Greens’ Nick McKim and the Nationals’ Matt Canavan demanding (in rhyme) that “Lowe must go”. Lowe says: I can assure you I have no plans to resign. He also defended his position in late 2021 that the RBA’s cash rate would not rise until 2024. Those comments, Lowe said, were “highly conditional”. “Can I correct you,” Lowe told a Sky business reporter. “Because I did not promise” that timing, even if many people interpreted it that way. Academic macroeconomists who have lately spoken to Guardian Australia have tended to agree with Lowe. His comments were taken to mean more than Lowe was actually saying. The point they make, though, is that Lowe would have seen how his comments were being taken by the public (such as by mortgage brokers who have a vested view about what they tell potential clients) and correcting that misinterpretation was within Lowe’s powers. China quiet on Anthony Albanese’s proposal for meeting with Xi Jinping China’s foreign ministry hasn’t exactly jumped at Anthony Albanese’s proposal for a meeting with President Xi Jinping, saying it has “nothing to share” when asked by journalists about whether the leaders could meet in coming months. Albanese said yesterday he was “open to dialogue” with Xi, after China’s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, suggested there could be a long-awaited meeting between the leaders – potentially at an upcoming international summit. “I’m open to dialogue with anyone at any time, particularly with leaders of other nations. It’s a good thing if there’s dialogue and if such a meeting took place I would welcome it,” Albanese said. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning was asked about a potential meeting at a press conference and said: The sound and steady development of China-Australia relations is in the shared interest of both countries and peoples and conducive to peace, stability, development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region. China stands ready to follow the principle of mutual respect and mutual benefit and work with Australia to steadily advance bilateral relations along the track of comprehensive strategic partnership and bring benefits to the two peoples. As for a meeting between the leaders, I have nothing to share. Mao said China was “ready to work with Australia to steadily advance bilateral relations along the track of comprehensive strategic partnership”. But asked if a meeting was possible, she added: “I have no information to offer.” RBA governor reiterates how wages pick up will influence future interest rate rises The Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, has reiterated that how wages pick up will influence how hard he hits the brakes with more interest rate rises. “The main uncertainty we have is how the labour market is going to respond to this period of high inflation,” he said. “I know it’s very difficult for people to accept the fact that wages are not rising with higher inflation.” (Ask the ACTU’s Sally McManus and a few million others.) “It’s very difficult, and it’s causing a lot of people distress,” but the alternative is that inflation becomes “protracted”, requiring even higher interest rates later on and even more unemployment levels. “And that’s going to hurt low-income people more,” Lowe said. However, given profits are at record levels while labour’s share of the economy is at a record low level, that’s going to be a hard argument to make stick, you’d have to think. Greg Jericho has noted that in his excellent column today: and here: (Continued from previous post) McKim speaks about national account figures out on Wednesday and says they clearly show “that wages share of national income is at all-time record lows and profits share of the national income is at all-time record highs.” “Never ... have workers had such a small slice of the pie and never have the corporates had such a big slice of the pie – never in the entire history of national accounts,” he says. He says the figures also show it was a “massive mistake” for the RBA to put up interest rates so rapidly, saying hundreds of thousands of Australians had been induced into taking out mortgages because they believed the RBA when it said interest rates would not go up until 2024. (continued from previous post) Thorpe is talking about the failure of successive governments to implement recommendations from the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody 31 years ago, saying “implementing those recommendations means saving lives”. She also speaks about the process for treaty, saying it needs to come before constitutional recognition. Thorpe says: It is time for this nation to mature and go forward with a treaty. The only mechanism to truly unite is treaty and we see examples of that around the world. Once we get our treaty and once we go through the process of treaty, then we can have a conversation about how we go into the coloniser’s constitution, and in that order is the very essence of how we are going to get real outcomes. Thorpe is also asked about her protest at the Midwinter Ball at Parliament House last night which had fossil fuel companies among its sponsors. She says Woodside and Shell have “done a lot of damage to country” and “a lot of damage to Indigenous people across this country”. They’ve never gained free prior and informed consent to have any of the explorations that they’ve been doing. The process is flawed to gain consent from traditional owners. In fact, it’s unconscionable conduct how these mining companies and governments receive consent from traditional owners. It’s all manufactured. It’s a dangle of a car or a dangle of a job and hand-picking those that will say yes for the money or the car. So it’s a flawed system, and so I was having a go at Woodside and Shell and anyone who supported them at that fossil fuel ball. When asked about the attendance of several Greens MPs and senators at the event, Thorpe says “they protested”. Just before question time, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, gave a press conference with senators Lidia Thorpe and Nick McKim. Bandt was speaking about the climate bill being debated in the Senate, which is expected to pass this afternoon, saying it is a “small step” to tackling climate change, but much more work is yet to be done. He is flagging the party’s intentions to use its balance of power position in the Senate to push the government to do more when it moves to legislate changes to the safeguard mechanism. The Greens are readying for a fight over the new change, and are warning Labor against doing a deal with the Liberals, who in government flagged changes to the mechanism that was first introduced by Tony Abbott. Bandt says the ball is now in Labor’s court: Do they want to work with the Liberals to keep all of the loopholes in a safeguard mechanism that Tony Abbott put there and have a scheme that allows pollution to go up and new coal and gas mines to be open? Or does Labor want to work with the Greens as it designs the safeguard mechanism, so we come up with a plan that sees pollution go down, not up, and it tackles this question of new coal and gas. We’ve shown very clearly we’ve been prepared to work constructively with the government to get action on climate now the rubber hit the road as the government starts to tell us exactly how they’re going to cut pollution from these big coal and gas plants. We’re ready to work with them. But really the question now is, is Labor going to try to design a scheme to satisfy the Liberals, or are they going to work with the Greens on a scheme that might cut pollution. Over in the Senate, it looks like the business of the climate bill vote is finishing up – which means it should be back with the house for a final vote, very soon. Sorry about the delay – I had a small internet issue. Back on deck now. OK – time to grab whatever it is that helps get you through QT. We’re almost ready to head to the chamber. 20% rise in cost of new homes among the uneven price increases RBA model did not predict The RBA governor, Philip Lowe, also noted that new dwellings have cost 20% more to build in the past year – another of the “sectoral” differences that the bank’s broader model didn’t pick up so well. The psychology of inflation is something Lowe says the bank is watching closely, and so far those expectations haven’t taken off. “Inflation expectations have picked up a little, but the measures derived from financial prices suggest there is a high degree of confidence that inflation will return to target [of between 2-3% over the medium term],” he said. “This suggests that a pick-up in inflation expectations is not a primary driver of the sharp rise in inflation.” How wages rise will contribute to how those expectations play out, he says. “If workers and businesses come to expect higher inflation, and wages growth and price-setting behaviour adjusts accordingly, the task of navigating that narrow path will be very difficult, if not impossible,” Lowe said. The US, for instance, has wages rising at 5% a year, well above their 2-3% inflation target, he said. (Australia’s wage price index was rising at a 2.6% annual pace in the June quarter.) Philip Lowe on what lessons the RBA has learned from Big Miss on inflation The RBA governor says while the central bank didn’t get it right on inflation, neither did other economists, and posts a chart to show that. As I recall, the big CPI jump was the 5.1% rise in the March quarter – none of the economists had picked a number with a 5 in it. Needless to say, the Morrison government wasn’t too happy about that inflation surprise either given that landed 27 April, smack bang in the middle of their (failed) re-election campaign. Lowe goes on to talk about the lessons the RBA has learned from the Big Miss. One is that it was relying on aggregate demand models that didn’t adequately pick up things going haywire because of Covid. He cites the demand shift towards goods v services during the working from home period. (Still, given how much coverage the media gave to those issues, it’s surprising the RBA didn’t question whether it might be missing something.) RBA carefully watching ‘inflation psychology’, governor says The RBA governor has made reference in his speech to the Anika Foundation to the vibe (my paraphrasing – he calls it inflationary psychology) – something some economists and economic writers have been warning about – where prices increase because we expect them to increase. Lowe: There’s something here that’s worth watching. It’s not easily captured in our standard models. And that’s the general inflation psychology in our community. By this I mean the general willingness of businesses to seek price increases and the willingness of the community to accept those price increases. Prior to the pandemic, it was very, very difficult for a business person to stand in the public square and say they were putting their prices up. And a common theme from our liaison was because most businesses found it difficult to put their prices up, they had trouble putting their wages up. Wages growth had to be kept modest because price increases were modest and that was the predominant mindset in Australian business. Today business people are able to stand in the public square and say they’re putting their prices up. And they can point to a number of reasons why. The community clearly doesn’t like this. I think there’s a begrudging acceptance of it, the higher price increases. And with prices increasing, it’s harder for businesses to resist bigger wage increases, especially given the labour market is so tight. So the psychology in the community is shifting. Or, as the Bank for International Settlements put it, when inflation is high, it becomes a coordinating mechanism for pricing decisions. In simpler words, people really start to pay attention to changes in costs and prices. And I think that’s happening. The result can be faster and fuller pass-through of cost shocks and more frequent price and wage adjustments. There is some evidence that is already occurring, which is contributing to the strength of the pick-up in inflation. So this is something that we’ll watching very carefully, this general shift in the inflation psychology. The Reserve Bank will need to lift its key interest rate at least twice more to ensure the “scourge” of inflation is contained, with the pace and size of increases determined in part by how fast wages pick up, the bank governor Philip Lowe has said in a speech this afternoon. Lowe told the Anika Foundation a “very large surprise in inflation” had caught the RBA and other central banks flatfooted. They had no choice but to lift the cost of borrowing to stop an “inflation psychology” taking hold, he said. The board expects that further increases in interest rates will be required over the months ahead,” Lowe said, according to a speech circulated by the RBA. “But how high interest rates need to go and how quickly we get there will be guided by the incoming data and the evolving outlook for inflation and the labour market.” Lowe’s comments follow Tuesday’s decision by the RBA board to lift its cash rate target by another 50 basis points to 2.35%. The increase was the fifth in as many meetings and raised the benchmark rate to its highest since early 2015. The governor, who has faced calls by the Greens this week to be sacked, said the bank was “committed to doing what is necessary to ensure that inflation returns to target over time”. High inflation is a scourge. It damages our standard of living, creates additional uncertainty for households and businesses, erodes the value of people’s savings and adds to inequality,” Lowe said. “And without price stability, it is not possible to achieve a sustained period of low unemployment.” Lowe blamed the mistake of starting too late to lift the cost of borrowing in part to the unexpected Russian invasion of Ukraine in December. The resulting increase in energy prices as nations imposed sanctions on Russia had jolted inflation higher particularly in Europe but also contributed to Australia’s rise, he said. More soon. Morrison’s secret ministries butt of jokes at Midwinter Ball Some of you picked up on an earlier post that Anthony Albanese made reference to jokes about Scott Morrison’s secret ministries being made at the Midwinter Ball (which he said was actually a serious matter, despite also making for a good joke) So I did some secret squirrelling to find out what was said: Albanese in his traditional roast made a joke about Scott Morrison being “one to five in the ministry power list” (the order in which ministers are listed on the ministry list designates importance and is a big deal behind the scenes over who is what number. Peter Dutton in the traditional opposition leaders’ roast made a joke about him having held different ministries while in government, but he was “unaware I could have held them all at the same time”. And Mark Humphries made a joke about Morrison being well within his rights to try and pick up gigs on the speakers’ circuit as he had “just lost six jobs”. We are less than an hour away from the last question time of the week. Can’t wait to see how many questions Kristy McBain gets today. Peter Hannam tells me the RBA Governor Dr Phil Lowe’s speech at the Anika Foundation is quite interesting – he will bring you some of that very soon. David Littleproud speaks about keeping foot and mouth disease out of Australia Nationals leader David Littleproud had a chat to Adelaide radio 5AA where he dropped in this little anecdote in an interview about what he thinks the government needs to do about keeping foot and mouth disease out of Australia: Littleproud: I’m confident we will keep FMD out, but you need a minister that acts decisively, that challenges his department. Because I’ve got to say, when I said about the foot baths and foot mats, the department said to me it was more of an inconvenience for them to undertake that then it was about mitigating the risk. And so this is where you’ve got to be able to challenge the parliament. Q: Isn’t that a very odd answer? Because they’re not there for their own convenience. They’re there for the people that pay them. Littleproud: Well, that’s what shocked me is and they made this generalisation and it blew me away. They said, oh no everyone that comes back from Indonesia wears thongs. I mean, are you kidding me? I mean, this was the reason the Department of Agriculture told a former ag minister, albeit about two months after that I was in charge of them, that most people come back. I mean, I did have a little bit of corporate knowledge about agriculture and working with them, and this was the disappointing thing. And Murray Watt hasn’t had the ability to challenge them, hasn’t seen the intensity of the problem and acted decisively. And this is what exposes us. We’ve been lucky. This is a good move that he’s made, and I congratulate him for it, albeit too late. And it’s just been good luck rather than good management that we’ve kept this FMD out. But this is a real lesson and a real wake-up call to Australian consumers. You’re paying a lot already for your groceries and it would have got a lot worse if we got it here. The states and territories will switch to weekly reporting for Covid cases from tomorrow (a national cabinet decision) and by and large, governments have decided we are well and truly in the “moving on” stage of Covid management. But it’s still having a huge effect on people’s lives (long Covid is just one part of that – immunocompromised people and their families are now having to try and avoid the virus in a society that has largely stopped taking measures to halt the spread). And the economy is not immune – as AAP reports: Payroll jobs have fallen for the second month in a row largely due to workers catching Covid and other winter illnesses. The 0.8% fall in August follows a 0.6% drop in July. “The slightly lower number of payroll jobs continued to reflect the ongoing impacts of short-term employee absences from Covid and other illnesses during winter, within a tight labour market,” Australian Bureau of Statistics head of labour statistics Lauren Ford said. ABS data also showed the trade balance falling in July despite a strong performance in the June quarter. The balance on goods and services fell from $17.1b in June to $8.7b in July. The 9.9% fall in exports was led by a drop in coal, coke and briquettes, as well as metal ores and minerals. Imports lifted by 5.2% to $46.5b for the month. Exhibit A The senate really is just a human ball pit. Pictures really do speak 1,000 words. For those who didn’t see the earlier post, this from Peter Hannam is worth your time: It’s a nice little easter egg left over from Matt Kean’s time as environment minister and will no doubt give the Sky After Dark crew something new to talk about. And finally, there looks like there will be some action on payday loans. From Stephen Jones’ statement: Small Amount Credit Contracts and Consumer Leases The legislation will also introduce new protections for consumers of high-cost credit products known as SACCs (also known as payday loans) and consumer leases. These products are typically used by low-income households to purchase household goods, who may have limited access mainstream credit products, such as credit cards. These reforms aim to reduce the risk of financial hardship for consumers of these products, through for example, new caps and protected earnings amounts for consumer leases, enhanced and extended protected earnings amounts for SACCs, prohibitions on certain types of unsolicited marketing of SACCs and consumer leases, new disclosure obligations, enhanced sanctions for misconduct and the introduction of new anti-avoidance provisions targeting avoidance practices by predatory lenders. Then there is this one which was an election promise – and also something which had been called for for years to help vulnerable people: Compensation Scheme of Last Resort The government is delivering on its election commitment to establish a Compensation Scheme of Last Resort to ensure Australians continue to have trust and confidence in the financial system external dispute resolution framework. The CSLR will facilitate the payment of compensation of up to $150,000 to eligible consumers who have a determination from the Australian Financial Complaints Authority relating to personal financial advice, credit intermediation, securities dealing and credit provision which remains unpaid. The government will contribute towards the costs of the scheme in its first year of operation, which is proposed to commence from 1 July 2023. The scheme will be fully industry funded through a levy on relevant financial service and credit licensees in the subsequent years of the scheme’s operation. The government has also released for consultation exposure draft regulations to support the operation of the CSLR legislation. Further information is available on the Treasury consultation website. That’s just a very long way of saying banks and financial institutions need to be held more accountable for their decisions. The government is finalising its response to the banking royal commission with Stephen Jones introducing legislation which was part of the recommendations. There is a bit to get through, so I’ll spread it out over a couple of posts. First up: Financial Accountability Regime The government has finalised the legislation to implement recommendations to extend the Banking Executive Accountability Regime to all Apra-regulated entities and to provide for joint administration between Apra and Asic. The new Financial Accountability Regime imposes a strengthened responsibility and accountability framework that will ensure that the directors and most senior and influential executives of financial institutions will be held accountable for their decisions and conduct which have significant flow on effects for everyday Australians and the Australian economy. The FAR imposes heightened accountability obligations and ensures that where these obligations are not met, appropriate consequences will follow, including civil penalties for financial institutions and disqualification of senior executives as accountable persons. PM says ‘we need to act’ in response to breakdown of trust in government and public institutions There was a short question and answer session after Anthony Albanese gave his speech, which ended on this question: Q: The US has recently shown how fragile democracy is. How will the current government increase public trust in government, protect democracy and reduce corruption while the national agenda is delivered?’ Albanese: It is. We need to recognise that there is a breakdown in faith and trust, and we need to not take democracy for granted. In some places in the world it is in retreat. If you look at some of the surveys of young people about systems of government, that’s a little bit scary in terms of what system they think works better. And that’s why we need to act. I think that democracy is undermined by a lack of transparency and I think we’ve seen that. The reason why we’ve asked the former high court judge Virginia Bell to have a look at the fact that it would appear that the former treasurer wasn’t aware that there was another person as treasurer and as finance minister and health minister and all of that. Whilst it made for a number of really good jokes on this stage at the Midwinter Ball last night, it’s actually pretty serious. It’s actually pretty serious because under our legislation, for example, ministers have specific responsibility. Resources ministers, for example, are responsible for examining in an objective way, without interference from anyone else’s decision-making processes, to determine funding. I think is why it is a serious issue as much as it was a source of some good humour last night. The big picture element that we will do is to introduce legislation for a national anti-corruption commission. That will be introduced next week into our national parliament. I committed to it being introduced this year, so we’re doing it pretty early. We’re doing it so that there can be a full parliamentary examination through the committee process. And that will hopefully provide a ballast and some comfort that there is a process that’s not aimed at replacing existing mechanisms – because the truth is, there are a range of existing mechanisms which are in place, such as through the Australian Electoral Commission and through the various bodies of this parliament. But clearly we need to respond to that and the government will. But, also, I think there’s a need for a recognition of a changing culture as well. You can legislate and set rules, but you change mindsets as well. Over a period of time, there was a law of diminishing returns under Abbott, Turnbull, Morrison, whereby in the end all these funds were available. The budget in October will see some of the funds – that were just on the whim of a minister – wiped out as part of the savings that are required to help send the budget in a better direction than the way it was headed. There’s some tough decisions required that requires people in position of power to give up some of that power and to be accountable. There wasn’t a huge amount new in Anthony Albanese’s Ceda speech. He did, however, continue Labor’s push for revamping the bargaining system, explaining why he believes it is necessary: We also need to recognise a simple reality: the workplace bargaining system in this country is broken. It’s not delivering productivity gains for business – or wage rises for workers. And the inescapable, uncomfortable reality is that the workforces with the most women are the ones with the least bargaining power – and, as a result, the lowest pay. Aged care. Childcare. Disability care. Heroes of the pandemic. Workers we celebrate as essential, people who give expression to our Australian values: 1. looking after our loved ones when they grow older 2. educating our children 3. empowering Australians with disability to fulfil their potential. The Australians doing these jobs are among the best of us – but they are getting the worst of the deal. So whenever we talk about closing the gender pay gap, we should acknowledge that getting bargaining back on track is central to the task. Industry, small business and big employers will all benefit from a bargaining framework that’s more flexible, more straightforward and more attuned to the realities of work in Australia in the 2020s. Better bargaining will mean stronger wages growth, helping people with rising living costs. As SBS’s Naveen Razik points out, not all (utterances of) shit is treated equally: Seems like three weeks of Senate sittings is all it has taken for ACT independent senator David Pocock to have heard enough. He took aim at some of the sigh-inducing speeches he has had to hear from senators who are STILL questioning climate science (I don’t need to put in who. You know who. It’s always the same people). Pocock was pulled up for this: It seems like a pretty sad day in Australia where in 2022 we are hearing arguments about climate science after however long of the bullshit that Australians have had to… He was stopped for “unparliamentary” language. Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson chimed in with something along the lines of ‘where is the lie?’ but Pocock was made to withdraw anyway. Given we should see the climate legislation passed before the end of the day (after a trip back to the house) this is probably worth your time: Workers at Dnata, which provides baggage handling and other ground services to Qantas, have called off a strike planned for Monday after reaching a new agreement with the company. The Transport Workers Union said Dnata has agreed to a 17% pay rise over four years, better conversion to full time and permanent work for part-time and casual employees, and improved consultation over workplace changes. Dnata also dropped a bid to reduce overtime entitlements, the TWU said. Workers had planned to go on strike for 24 hours, beginning at 3.30am on Monday. The action would have primarily hit international flights, but would have had knock-on effects that could also have affected local flights that have already been beset by delays and cancellations, sparking an investigation into Qantas by the consumer watchdog. While the union and Dnata have reached agreement, approval for the new deal is required from the Fair Work Commission. The TWU is hopeful of reaching agreement this week with another of the three main companies handling Qantas baggage, Menzies, where strike action was also on the cards. However an industrial battle looms with the third, Swissport, when its existing agreement expires at the end of the year. The TWU is already fighting a PR war against Swissport, which is regarded as strongly anti-union, this week releasing a dossier of safety memos that revealed incidents including firearms left on baggage carousels. There are now 53 bills which have been introduced to the parliament after three or so (ceremonial days aside) weeks of sitting. Europe’s largest electricity company sets sight on Australian clean energy market AAP has an energy update: A world leader in wind power and green hydrogen has earmarked $4.4bn for Australia. Lured by new climate laws that will require billions of dollars of private capital to modernise a coal-dependent electricity grid, Europe’s largest electricity company Iberdrola is looking to expand its footprint. Chair and CEO, Ignacio Galán, has met Anthony Albanese and Energy and climate change minister, Chris Bowen, and is also wooing state leaders and local investment partners. “The full ratification of Australia’s decarbonisation targets will align federal policies with the ambitions already shown by most states, and the commitment shown by Australian companies and wider society,” Galán said. Already running Europe’s largest industrial green hydrogen plant in Spain, he said Australia could consolidate its reputation as one of the largest global energy exporters by producing green hydrogen. Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest also has his sights set on green hydrogen and green steel, and has the Sun Cable project underway with fellow Australian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes to harness mass-scale solar power. “There is huge global demand from industry for new climate solutions such as green hydrogen, green ammonia and green steel,” Galán said. Under the new federal regime, he expected Australia to quickly lead the way in new clean economy technologies and sees “massive potential” in green hydrogen. The clean energy company already has a footprint in Australia after buying renewable energy utility Infigen Energy two years ago, and is building the Mount James wind farm and Broadsound solar plant in Queensland. Sydney-based Autonomous Energy, bought this year, services commercial and industrial companies. The new commitment would double Iberdrola’s share of energy generation for a grid that market operators - and the federal government – intend to ramp up to 82% renewables. NSW becomes first state to treat CO2 as pollutant to ensure industries cut emissions While the federal parliament edges closer to passing the Albanese government’s climate bill, the country’s most populous - and as it happens, Coalition-led – state has just launched some climate action of its own. NSW, along with other states and territories, has a more ambitious emissions goal than the commonwealth is trying to pass. Each – with the exception of the ACT – has a plan to cut 2005-level emissions by half by 2030, compared with the Albanese pledge of 43% over that time. (The ACT is looking at a 65-75% emissions cut on the way to net zero by 2045, five years before all other jurisdictions.) Anyway, NSW is moving towards a more aggressive implementation policy than the commonwealth is planning - at least according to the draft climate policies being released for eight weeks of consultations from today: The state’s Environment Protection Authority is planning to licence carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as pollutants, and then work with polluters to cut those levels. The EPA currently regulates some 50,000 enterprises, so the task is going to be a big one. The EPA’s new CEO, Tony Chappel, has told us he expects the plan will complement the federal government’s so-called safeguard mechanism that is supposed to target emissions of the 215 or so biggest polluting installations nationwide. We can expect a bit of flak from the NSW policy but it has been approved by the Perrottet-led cabinet. Apart from the emissions component, the plan will also examine the extent the polluters are going to cope with the impacts of climate change. Adaptation, in other words, not just mitigation. Crucial to the prompt was a court case led by survivors from the black summer bushfires that said the EPA wasn’t behaving according to its own act. It will be interesting to see if EPAs and environment departments everywhere (including in the federal government) face the same test. Infrastructure minister says Australia will be ‘well and truly left behind’ if it does not start developing high speed rail system Catherine King was asked about the high speed rail Utopia clip on ABC News Breakfast this morning (it seems it is the first thing a lot of us think of) and was asked about whether the cost stacked up. She said: The last time we did the business case, and we will update that as part of the High Speed Rail Authority that will be one of their tasks, was that it had a cost benefit ratio of every dollar you spent that you would return $2. This obviously, I’m not going to pretend that this isn’t an incredibly expensive thing to do, which is why that Newcastle-to-Sydney and the Central Coast bit is really important because of the density of population there. But it is viable. And it is certainly something that - whether it’s popular or not really isn’t the focus that we’ve got - it’s about actually what are the needs of our community, the way in which they’re going to be using transport, the way in which communities along the eastern seaboard are developing, not just in this term of government, but in the next 20, 30, 40 years. And if we don’t start doing this now, you know, we will be well and truly left behind other nations in terms of high speed rail. Looking through the transcripts, it seems Jim Chalmers drew the short straw for government ministers after the ball, with five early morning media interviews. For those watching the Senate, we should see a vote on the climate bills soon(ish) because, as you may remember, the government has accepted some of David Pocock’s amendments, which means the bill has to go back to the house for a final check off before it can be sent for royal assent. (If the Senate amends a house bill, the house has to agree to the amendments as well.) I can’t hear the words high speed rail without thinking of this episode of Utopia: But Australia is taking a step towards a very fast train. Catherine King will introduce legislation to establish a High Speed Rail Authority, which will build on “previous work including the comprehensive study, commissioned under former Infrastructure Minister and now Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, that found high speed rail was not only viable, but would return over $2 for every $1 of investment”. “A high-speed rail network could allow passengers to travel between major cities and significant regional cities at speeds exceeding 250 km/h.” Which is what gets everyone very excited. Let’s see though, what happens from here. King is optimistic though – as long as no one expects to see a very fast train in Australia anytime soon: High-speed rail offers the promise to change the lives of millions of Australians, especially in our regions, while also bringing our east coast capitals closer together. This is a visionary investment in opening up our regions to greater opportunity. A high-speed rail network recognises the importance of prosperity in our regions, which will benefit from enhanced connection to our major cities and international gateways. No project captures the imagination of Australians quite like high-speed rail, and we are committed to realising the massive benefits this project could bring. This is a long-term project, but with the pragmatic advice of the High Speed Rail Authority we can take a genuine path forward. Albanese and former PMs to attend Shinzo Abe’s funeral in Japan in late September Anthony Albanese will travel to Japan for the funeral of former prime minister Shinzo Abe. Albanese will arrive in Japan on September 26 and leave on September 28. He won’t be alone; former prime ministers John Howard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, all of whom worked with Abe during his two terms as Japanese prime minister, will join the official delegation. Albanese: We mourn the loss of a true statesman. Mr Abe was a remarkable leader, a catalyst for change in Japan and the region, a true friend of Australia. Under Mr Abe’s leadership, Australia and Japan deepened our economic ties, defence cooperation and people-to-people links – he was deeply committed to furthering relations between our two countries. Japan is a close and trusted friend of Australia. Our partnership is fundamental to both countries’ strategic and economic interests. We will continue to strengthen our partnership to promote a free, open and resilient region. If anyone can enlighten me as to what Angus Taylor was actually saying, that would be great. Angus Taylor will not say whether he thinks Labor’s childcare subsidy increase should start earlier than July 2023 So what needs to happen according to Angus Taylor? “A timely plan.” Patricia Karvelas wanted to know what that actually means. What about the childcare subsidy increase – should the government bring it forward? PK: Do you think it should start in January, yes or no? Taylor: Well, what we are saying is we need to see a comprehensive plan. PK: That’s not the question. The word “plan”, with respect, Angus Taylor – it doesn’t mean a lot. It is the word “plan”. It is very vague. It’s a very “vibe” kind of word. So I’ll ask you something specifically: childcare, should it start in January? Taylor: We need a timely plan. That includes a number of those initiatives we have outlined here … [There’s] a big menu to choose from, but waiting until later next year is not a timely plan. PK: So does that mean you support childcare reforms, Labor’s plan, coming in earlier? You say they are waiting too long – you can’t have it both ways. Taylor: At the end of the day, Labor is now in government and they have access to all the advice they need to look at the full menu of options of sensible things they can do that are going to strengthen the economy and at the same time, reduce inflationary pressures. We were very strong supporters in government of sensible childcare initiatives that would add to the supply side … PK: So are you changing your mind on the childcare changes? Taylor: No, we are saying there needs to be a comprehensive plan but we are seeing from Labor the exact opposite… PK: Well, no, they have a plan for childcare, it starts in July. You say that is too far away; should it happen earlier? Taylor: You know, PK. The initial test for this is: if the plan is not going to reduce pressures in the short term on the household bills of Australians, that is not a timely plan. Let’s be clear about that. PK continues to press Taylor on whether Labor’s childcare subsidy increase should happen earlier, but he only goes as far as to say “we need timely action from the government”. Shadow treasurer say government’s plan to allow more pensioners to work should go further The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, also appeared on ABC radio RN Breakfast this morning, where he was repeating the Coalition’s line that the government needs to come up with a plan to deal with the cost of living pressures. So what needs to happen? It’s complicated. Taylor wants the government to take up its idea of allowing pensioners to work. Which Labor is doing. But Taylor wants more pensioners to be able to take part. Won’t that put more money into the economy during a time of rising inflation? Not, Taylor says, if the government deals with the supply side pressures. If you can relieve those supply side pressures, then it won’t be inflationary and that’s why it’s so valuable. And that’s why these sorts of initiatives that we’ve proposed are so valuable, and you’ve got to get on and do them now. Victoria has reported 24 more lives lost to Covid, with 227 people being treated for the virus in hospital. RBA’s Philip Lowe to give speech on inflation and monetary policy framework The RBA governor, Dr Philip Lowe, will give a speech today on “inflation and the monetary policy framework” which will be received with quite a bit of interest given *gestures to everything*. The governor’s address to the Anika Foundation is an annual event. Given we often concentrate just on the speech itself, I thought it might be nice knowing some of the context behind where it’s held. The foundation was established in the memory of Anika Wignall, and the annual address also helps raise awareness of the foundation’s work. You can read some of Anika’s story and the foundation’s work through that link. She was also a budding poet – here is one of her poems: People are like flowers There are many different types None of them are identical Some die out And some live on Some flourish and bloom Bright with colours Others stay normal and plain Many aren’t recognised, and stay as buds -never come out Some are pointed out and get great recognition But all flowers have their chance to bloom And only half of them do NSW has reported 25 more lives lost to Covid, with 1,530 people in hospital being treated for the virus. Looks like you can expect more questions for Kristy McBain in QT today. Paul Fletcher dropped by doors as the opposition still try to make fetch happen: We need to see the prime minister and his ministers demonstrate that they are taking compliance with the ministerial code seriously. The prime minister talked a great deal about integrity and accountability and he needs to explain how his code operates, how he’s satisfied that his ministers are in compliance with it. His ministers need to explain how that satisfied themselves that they are in compliance with the code. We heard a lot from Mr Albanese … about new standards of integrity and accountability. This is now the first test, with a significant number of questions being asked about compliance with the ministerial code. This is a test about whether the prime minister – whether the Albanese Labor government – are going to live up to their rhetoric on transparency and accountability or whether in fact, as presently seems to be the case, there are no sanctions for breaching the ministerial code and if all that’s required is for a minister to say ‘I don’t think there’s a problem’ and we move on. That appears to be the approach. That’s a huge gap between what Mr Albanese campaigned on and the way that the Albanese Labor government is conducting itself on this matter. Although there is a fairly regular canine visitor to parliament these days. Toto, the prime minister’s beloved pup, is no stranger to parliament these days, no doubt raising the anxiety levels of the APH landscapers and gardeners by 247%. Bill Shorten is bringing puppies into parliament today for a Vision Australia event. There’s always room for puppies. Greens leader Adam Bandt reveals changes his party will demand to industrial emissions safeguard mechanism Adam Bandt has marked out what the Greens will demand if they are to support what may be Labor’s biggest climate policy challenge – changing the safeguard mechanism, the scheme that is supposed to bring down industrial greenhouse gas emissions. In prepared remarks released ahead of his appearance at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia conference in Canberra today, Bandt said the safeguard mechanism was a “rent seeker’s paradise” that was “cooked up by Tony Abbott” and “written by the coal and gas industry”. He said the policy was “the wrong way to go” to cut emissions from industry, but the Greens were ready to work with Labor to improve it if the government’s changes ensured that pollution actually went down, including forcing “real cuts” from coal and gas. The safeguard mechanism was meant to prevent increases in industrial emissions. In practice, companies have been allowed to increase pollution without penalty and industrial emissions have continued to rise since it began in 2016. The government has released a consultation paper on changes meant to start next July. It says the 215 major polluting facilities covered by the scheme will have emissions baselines set, or limits, that will be gradually reduced over time. Companies will either have to cut emissions onsite or buy carbon credits (meant to represent emissions cuts elsewhere). Bandt’s remarks framed the debate over the safeguard as about coal and gas developments. He said 50% of the pollution covered by the scheme came from those fossil fuel industries, and that the choices over the safeguard design could “set the course of climate policy for the next decade and determine whether pollution rises or falls”. He said the government would have to choose whether it wanted to work with the Liberals or Greens to get its changes to the scheme through parliament. If they choose to work with us they’ll need to address some key issues. First pollution has to go down, not up. That means real cuts from coal and gas, not just hot air. Second, the question of new coal and gas has to be addressed. And third, the scheme has to have real integrity. Acoss and ACTU join forces to call for higher jobseeker rate and other policy changes The Australian Council of Social Services and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have announced they have “come to an agreement” on a range of issues. According to the joint statement, the agreement calls for a range of policy changes including: Lifting jobseeker and related income support payments to pension levels, from $46 to $70 per day. Creation of secure, well-paid jobs in the community and care sectors including through adequate funding and expanded access to a fairer and simpler bargaining system, including multi-employer bargaining. Replacement of the racist and discriminatory CDP with employment programs designed by First Nations communities which will deliver secure employment and drive economic growth in remote communities Raising the jobseeker rate to $70 is still under the Henderson poverty line – which at this point, would need the rate to be raised to $88 a day to sit above it. A new inquiry into poverty in Australia will be carried out by a senate committee thanks to Janet Rice – there is hope it will recommend a new measure for poverty, to try and get everyone on the same page. Inflation will start to moderate next year, treasurer says Over on ABC radio’s RN Breakfast, Jim Chalmers is being pushed by Patricia Karvelas on when Australians can expect to see sunnier budget climes. Chalmers says he has been having “frank” conversations with Australians about the budget situation and the economy, but he doesn’t want people to think he is not optimistic about the future. Inflation will start to moderate next year and we’re realistic about that ... but there is genuine reason to be optimistic about our economy. Chalmers also said that he doesn’t see the October budget in isolation and that there is another budget in May, so he sees it as more of a two-parter. Treasurer says ‘it is not for me to take pot shots’ at RBA governor Philip Lowe over past statements on interest rates Does Jim Chalmers believe the RBA governor Dr Phil Lowe should be accountable for his repeated statements in late 2020 and 2021 that interest rates would not be raised until at least 2024? Greens senator Nick McKim has called for Lowe to step down given the interest rate rises (with more to come), saying Australians made decisions based on Lowe’s statements. Chalmers has a different take: I think he has given his account on what happened over that period. In his words, the economy got back on track earlier than he thought that it would, and he has, I think, answered that pretty honestly and openly in the last few months in particular, as he has attracted some of this criticism for his language in the past. For me as the country’s Treasurer, it is not for me to take pot shots at Phil Lowe. My interest is to get the right institutional settings. People will rightly ask the governor questions about the recent decisions and recent language. My job is to get the system right and also to focus on the things that the government can have an influence on. So in my case, in the budget and at the jobs and skills summit last week, it is all about dealing with the constraints in our economy which are pushing up inflation, whether it is labour and skills shortages, a lack of training, whether it is issues in energy – all of these other key investments that we want to make in the budget are about lifting the speed limit on the economy without adding to the inflationary pressures. That is my job, I take responsibility for that. The governor can explain the decisions that the board makes. Canberra’s Midwinter Ball makes a comeback after two years’ absence From what I am hearing, the first Midwinter Ball since the pandemic started was fairly calm, with everyone in good spirits. The Saturday Paper’s (and friend of the Guardian) Karen Middleton won Press Gallery Journalist of the Year, an award which was very well deserved. Marcia Hines performed, and Mark Humphries had some pretty good jokes: It’s great to see the ABC celebrating their 90th birthday and all of a sudden News Corp is in favour of euthanasia. And Anthony Albanese, in the traditional prime minister’s roast, poked fun at his election brain fade on the unemployment rate, “forgetting” how much the Midwinter Ball had raised for charity across its history – “it’s four point … wait, five point zero …?” Greens senator Lidia Thorpe staged a small protest in the Marble Hall as everyone was gathered about to go inside, yelling “fossil fools” – the event was partly sponsored by fossil fuel company Woodside. Treasurer says scrapped leadership grant ‘didn’t pass muster’ in budget review Jim Chalmers is up bright and early doing the media rounds. He spoke to ABC News Breakfast about the government scrapping the $18m leadership foundation grant the governor general had backed. Paul Karp has you covered on that here: Asked why it was scrapped, Chalmers says: What we are doing is going right through the budget, line by line, to make sure that we are getting value for money for some of the commitments in the budget, and that one didn’t pass muster from our point of view, and so we won’t be providing that $18 million or the ongoing funding after that as well. We have to take some difficult decisions in the budget. There have been some funds committed which will not be proceeding, and that’s an example of that. And there will be other examples, too, which you will see in the budget. There will not be any further investigation into the grant. This is a grant that came out of the Prime Minister &amp; Cabinet department, so they’ve done the work, the due diligence, along with other departments, finance and Treasury and others, to see if we would get value for money for this. The conclusion is we would not, so we won’t be providing that money. I think Australians know, when we’ve got this budget with a trillion dollars in debt, that every dollar in the budget has got to be defensible. We’ve got to ensure we get value for money and bang for buck. I don’t think we can make that case there and that’s why we won’t be providing the funding. We have made it to the last sitting day of the week – but lucky for us, there are another four next week! We’re just spoilt that way. The prime minister will start the morning speaking to a conference of the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, telling the conference he wants Australia to build things again. That’s something Anthony Albanese has been wanting for sometime. It was one of his favourite speeches before he was prime minister and played a big part of his election campaign, so it’s no surprise to see it pop up now that he actually has some power to make it happen. He’s backing up from the Midwinter Ball which I hear was pretty uneventful. I didn’t go, so I’m not bound by the Chatham House rule; if I hear any tidbits, I’ll let you know. Labor should get its climate bill through the Senate today – it declared the bill “urgent” earlier in the week so it could call it to a vote when it wanted, and we should see that happen today. Moderate Liberals like Simon Birmingham are saying they won’t be voting for it because it’s not necessary to legislate a target and the bill is a bit of grandstanding, so don’t expect any of the opposition to cross the floor in the senate. But it’s not necessary anyway – the Greens are reluctantly supporting it and David Pocock says he won’t be the one to stand in front of what little climate action we’ve seen from our politicians so far, so the bill will pass. The Greens will continue to push the government to do more, though – so given their powerful position in the Senate, expect some ongoing push and pull. We’ll cover it all off before the MPs make the Thursday afternoon dash to the airport. It’s a wet grey day in Canberra which should help a few of the heads in the building after last night’s revelries, but also means everyone just wants to get home. Sames. It’s at least a four-coffee day – maybe a six-coffee day for Mike Bowers who has not stopped this week. So we’ll just get into it before we stop for too long and can’t get up again.

A national crisis turned first into a North Korea tribute act then to a second-rate turn on the comedy circuit. Minutes before the Supreme Leader’s speech the cabinet filed into the hall like Stepford Wives and took their seats. Never before have so many mediocrities received such a long standing ovation. Moments later Stanley Johnson and Carrie Symonds got an even more enthusiastic reception. All hail the man whose sperm had created Boris! All hail the lucky woman who shared Boris’s bed! The audience was not worthy. The Who singing about “teenage wasteland” might not be every party leader’s choice of entrance music, but start as you mean to go on. No one can accuse Boris Johnson of not understanding his demographic. Cries of “BO-RIS, BO-RIS” echoed round the hall as the Incredible Sulk slowly made his way to the front. He was determined to milk every second. This was more than the fulfilment of a dream, it was his birthright. A golden moment delivered on a silver spoon. That, though, was about as good as it got. On reaching the podium the Sulk had his first moment of self-doubt. He’d really meant to write a proper speech. A serious, grown-up speech for serious, grown-up times. A manifesto for government. But what with one thing and another – his natural laziness, mostly – he’d never got round to it and it was only after breakfast that he had finally made a start. And then his mind had gone totally blank. So he’d done what he always did under these circumstances. Recycle a few of the gags from his old Telegraph columns and hope no one noticed. He opened with some half-hearted praise for Theresa May and Ruth Davidson – who were they again? – before moving on to his central theme that parliament was essentially a total waste of time. Just a bunch of interfering nobodies who were stopping him from doing exactly as he pleased. That a UK prime minister should portray MPs as enemies of the people was extraordinary in itself. That a UK prime minister who had been elected by just 150,000 members of his own party should do so was breathtaking. But then hypocrisy has never bothered Johnson. Morals are for lesser mortals. As for Brexit, it was basically a breeze. Something that could be reduced to a couple of glib sentences. Whatever the EU might say to the contrary, the customs union and the Good Friday agreement were basically just trivial technicalities of little consequence. One way or another he’d get Brexit done. Or maybe he wouldn’t. He didn’t say how exactly, because he didn’t know. And didn’t much care. If it didn’t work out, he could always blame the EU. Or parliament. Anyone but himself. Just tell the people what you think they want to hear. Ten minutes in, the Sulk realised that he’d basically said all he wanted to say and was tempted to wind things up. But then he remembered he was meant to keep going for at least 35 minutes, so he began to ad-lib. “You’re entitled to ask about my core principles,” he said. Whoops. Not such a good line, as he didn’t really have any. Other than entitlement. This wasn’t the time to talk about his treatment of women and disregard for public money. Besides he couldn’t remember exactly what had happened – but if he could he would be certain it hadn’t happened. Then he just slipped into auto-pilot and moved to his favourite subject. Himself. Me, me, me. Punctuated by gags that hadn’t been particularly funny when he’d first told them years ago. How he’d basically invented the NHS by grabbing it by the thigh and developed a cure for breast cancer. Those healing hands of his again. It was only a matter of time before he was awarded a Nobel prize for medicine to go with the peace prize he’d been given for his efforts in rekindling the Troubles in Northern Ireland. It was desperate stuff. The shallow optimism of a man for whom the truth has always been another country. Did the conference remember how some people had rubbished solar power? It ought to have done because one of those doing the rubbishing had been the Sulk itself. See Daily Telegraphs passim. Now we were on the brink of a new era of nuclear fusion with Britain at the fore. That will be news to the science world, though it could be enough to secure Johnson a hat-trick of Nobel laureates. There were lies. He lied about London being the most productive region of the EU. He lied about extending UK membership of the EU costing the country £1bn a month. But he didn’t care. Now that he was riffing on Michael Gove’s cocaine use, Jennifer Arcuri’s laptop pizza wheel of doom, his father’s appearance on I’m a Celebrity, he was in his element. Finally he was relaxed and enjoying himself. Lost in his own narcissistic world where he was totally killing it. Where everyone loved him. Which is all he had ever really wanted. What he missed was that the thing he was killing was himself. He was actually dying on his feet. Tory party members had come in search of a vision. A reason to believe after the despair of May. Salvation. Something prime ministerial. And what he’d given them was a vacuous after-dinner speech. They had heard better from a totally pissed father of the bride. The Sulk had shown he was a man for the small occasion. He got an ovation. Of course. The audience need him every bit as much as he needs them. They feel their world closing in and are desperate for a way out. A chink of light. But the applause and cries of “Bo-ris, Bo-ris” were notably less enthusiastic than when he’d arrived in the hall. Their emperor had no clothes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/dec/18/too-hot-for-humans-first-nations-people-fear-becoming-australias-first-climate-refugees","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-17T17:00:55Z","webTitle":"Too hot for humans?

First Nations people fear becoming Australia's first climate refugees","bodyText":"Josie Douglas sits on a verandah overlooking a ridge of red rocks and earth, scrubby with saltbush and spinifex near the centre of Alice Springs. It’s late afternoon and only 31C – a reprieve from a run of days in the high 30s and 40s. But Douglas knows that from now on it will only get hotter. Last summer was the hottest on record, and the driest in 27 years in central Australia. Five per cent of the town’s street trees died. A heat monitoring study showed that on some unshaded streets the surface temperature was between 61C and 68C. “We can’t keep going on the way we’re going,” says Douglas, who is manager of policy and research at the Central Land Council. “Central Australian Aboriginal people are very resilient. They have evolved to cope with the harsh and variable desert climate, but there are limits. “Without action to stop climate change, people will be forced to leave their country and leave behind much of what makes them Aboriginal. Climate change is a clear and present threat to the survival of our people and their culture.” Across central Australia, people are bracing themselves for another scorching summer of drought. At least nine remote communities and outstations are running out of water. A further 12 have reported poor quality drinking water as aquifers run low and the remaining supply is saline. Temperature records have already been broken. In the year to July 2019, Alice Springs had 129 days over 35C, and 55 days over 40C. It wasn’t meant to be like this – at least, not yet. The national science agency, the CSIRO, predictedthat these temperatures would not arrive until 2030. As the Northern Territory’s environment minister, Eva Lawler, said last September: “If we don’t do anything, the NT will become unliveable.” The problem is where to start. In Alice Springs opinion is divided among local politicians about the impact climate change is having on life in the desert. Sitting on the grassy lawn outside the council, Jimmy Cocking of the Arid Lands Environment Centre talks openly about climate refugees: those who have already come into town, and those who will have to come in the near future. “We’re going to end up with a whole bunch of internally displaced people within the Northern Territory in remote Australia, if we’re not planning for that,” he says. “If regional centres like Alice Springs and others aren’t planning to be able to deal with the influx of climate refugees internally within our region, we’re going to be left flatfooted and unable to deal with any of the challenges and social consequences that will come from that.” Cocking is on the town council and has sought to pass motions to declare a climate emergency. But the mayor, Damien Ryan, is reluctant to sound the climate alarm. “In local government speak, when you have an emergency, you close it down,” Ryan says. “I have not had any of the people who talk about an emergency say what is the next step. So you declare an emergency, what do you do then the next day? That’s never been made clear to me.” At its October meeting, the council did not agree on the word “emergency” but voted unanimously to say there was an “escalating urgency for climate action”. Douglas and the CLC say Aboriginal communities are doing what they can. “People are already mitigating climate change through traditional burning and they are investing their income from land use agreements to install solar power, plant bush tucker gardens in communities and operate swimming pools, but all that counts for little in the face of the lack of climate leadership from the government,” she says. ‘You see people hosing their brick houses’ The NT government says it has allocated $15m to “revitalising” the Alice Springs city centre. Some of those funds will go towards shade and landscaping to help cool the streets, and to public water stations. Ryan says the council is encouraging local schools to plant more trees. The Territory government says it has a climate change response strategy and is working with other governments and the Bureau of Meteorology to “develop national guidelines for the development of a warning system for extreme heat events”. In the meantime, Douglas says, people are living in houses that are “unbearable”. “During our summers you can sometimes see people in communities hosing the outside of their Besser brick walls with garden hoses to keep cool despite the water shortages – that’s how desperate they are.” About 3ookm north-west of Alice Springs is Yuendumu, the largest remote community in central Australia. Its 900 or so residents are facing summer without a reliable supply of adequate drinking water. The NT government has stopped building new housing because there isn’t enough water in the dwindling aquifer to accommodate more people. Yuendumu is not alone. The Central Land Council’s chief executive, Joe Martin-Jard, says that at every regional meeting, water security is top of the agenda. “Between Alice Springs and Mount Isa, there’s probably only one major community with a decent water supply,” Martin-Jard says. “We’re not getting the rain we used to, to recharge the aquifers. So as water is drawn out of the aquifers it becomes more saline and less potable [drinkable]. “It’s a really horrible dilemma.” The NT’s Power and Water Corporation, which is responsible for essential services in 72 remote communities and outstations, says most communities in the arid region are “faced with some level of water stress” and emergency planning is under way, but there are “rarely any simple solutions”. “The difficult reality is that many communities originally developed historically in locations where there was never any secure, reliable, high quality water resources in close proximity,” a spokesperson said. “As those communities have grown … and expectations of improved levels of service have appropriately increased, the challenges also continue to increase.” Power and Water says more drilling programs are planned but “finding new water sources is very challenging and often these drilling programs have moderate prospects for success”. “Without large or extended rainfall … the water security risks will progressively increase in some centres, with an increased likelihood that source supply capacity at some could fail.” At least 12 communities have reported poor quality drinking water. At Laramba, Willowra and Wilora, nitrates and uranium are at levels exceeding health guidelines. NT Power and Water says it is “investigating alternative technology options”. It has already installed treatment plants at Kintore, Ali Curung and Yuelamu to reduce high levels of nitrates, uranium and fluoride. ‘Air conditioning is essential in the desert’ In Alice Springs’ 18 town camps, where people from out bush often end up, houses are commonly built from Besser bricks – hollow concrete blocks which are cheap, but which trap the heat. There’s a lack of tree cover or other kinds of shade. Houses bake in the sun and, while the majority have solar panels, they often have only an evaporative air conditioning unit, known locally as a “swampy”, to cool the house. A “swampy” uses a lot of water and can struggle on hot days, especially when there are a lot of people sharing a house, which is common in town camps with big families and fluctuating populations. “Air conditioning is an essential item in the desert, not a luxury,” the CLC’s Josie Douglas says, “but it does not come standard.” When remote community and town camp tenants are offered housing, there is “a hole where the aircon unit should be and they are told to buy it themselves”. “Many can only afford to ‘close the gap’ with a piece of wood, or run expensive reverse-cycle aircon very sparingly,” she says. “Some places don’t have enough water to use a cheaper swampy.” Houses that don’t cool down overnight create big health and social problems. “People resort to sleeping outside, or cramming everybody into the coolest room of the house, with all the well-known consequences for the spread of diseases that whitefellas only know from medical textbooks. “It’s also common for people to sleep in shifts, with young people roaming the streets at night where they get into trouble, and sleeping during the day when they should be at school.” This is at odds with the NT government’s view of the quality of town camp and remote community housing. A government spokesperson tells Guardian Australia that homes are designed with weather conditions and regional climate in mind, and they include external shading, natural ventilation and insulation. “Investment into housing in town camps has included the installation of louvres, sunscreens, verandas and insulation,” the spokesperson said. “The Department of Housing and Community Development has also upgraded some key community infrastructure including improved shading and the installation of fans.” Douglas is calling on the government to “stop building concrete hotboxes”. “More than a decade ago, the government and the CLC were partners [in research] that came up with really solid recommendations about how to make desert houses more energy-efficient and communities more resilient. “Some measures, such as making sure houses are built with the right orientation … and have passive cooling and a white roof, cost almost nothing. We would like to know how many of these expensive research findings have been implemented in our region.” Shirleen Campbell is a Warlpiri and Arrernte woman who grew up at Hoppy’s Camp, or Lhenpe Artnwe. She told the Alice Springs climate rally in October that town campers were very worried about climate change. “This is our place,” she said. “If it gets too hot, if we suffer through endless droughts or we spoil our water, then we don’t have another place to go. “We want houses that are right for this place and right for our people. We want to invest in renewable energy, like solar.” Campbell is a co-coordinator of the women’s family safety group at Tangentyere council, which delivers services to and advocates on behalf of town camp residents. “Most of all we want people to treat this place as a legacy to be handed down to our children and grandchildren. It is not a speculative commodity and it is not something to be sold or exported. “We have been here for a long time and want to look after this place for those that come after.” Keeping cool in the library There are few public places in Alice Springs to cool off. The Yeperenye shopping centre has security guards at the doors and, according to Douglas and Campbell, Aboriginal people are regularly moved on. The library is a popular, free cool space. There’s a widescreen TV rigged up with headphones, showing movies. Westerns are popular, as are replays of AFL grand finals. The Saltbush room down the hall is a haven for older folk, while little mobs of kids hang out among the young adult stacks or cluster around the phone-charging station. “We found there’s a gap in after-school care services from about 2.30 to 4.30, the hottest time of the day,” says the head librarian, Clare Fisher. “The kids can come to the library, cool off, have fruit and sandwiches.” “Libraries are for connection and relaxation as well as knowledge. We make everyone welcome – but we explain how to use the library and how to behave as well. We very much believe in come and be who you are.” Thirsty and dying animals culled In January footage of dead and dying horses in a dry creek bed at Ltyentye Apurte, 80km south-east of Alice Springs, flashed around the world. The Ltyentye Apurte rangers had the unenviable task of dragging more than 100 dead horses from the creek bed and disposing of their bodies. In June the CLC conducted an emergency cull of more than 1,400 feral horses, donkeys, camels and cattle from a waterhole near Lajamanu. The animals were thirsty and dying, congregating around the last remaining springs and water sites. The CLC has eradicated 6,279 feral animals in preparation for summer. Traditional owners don’t usually support animal culls, the CLC says, but there were no alternatives, with so many animals dying or in poor condition. Feral animals damage community infrastructure and housing. Thirsty camels, for example, will attack air conditioning units because they smell water, and lay waste to water tanks, bores, fences, pipes and taps. How hot is too hot? Heat, health and housing hotboxes In town, Tangentyere council wants to measure exactly how well houses are functioning. Tangentyere’s social policy and research manager, Michael Klerk, is in discussions with the CSIRO to install temperature data loggers in people’s houses, to build a case for improvements that are taken for granted elsewhere: solar power, insulation, better air conditioning, wide awnings, more shade. “Last summer – which was a very hot summer, soon to be repeated – a lot of anecdotal feedback was that people’s evaporative air conditioners weren’t cooling the houses sufficiently,” Klerk says. “This probably reflects the reality that evaporative air conditioners are not good at cooling houses when the external temperatures are in the mid-40s. “You might drop the temperature of a house to mid-30s, but that’s not an optimal internal ambient temperature for comfort or for health.” Most people living in town camps and remote communities, and some in suburban public housing, have pre-paid electricity meters. Residents are issued a power card, which they top up with their welfare payments or income. Once the credit is spent, they have to top it up again, or go without electricity. Klerk says that happened a lot in the last quarter of 2018. In Alice Springs, 420 of 570 households with prepaid electricity meters had at least one self-disconnection, which lasted, on average, 7.5 hours. Of the 570 Alice Springs meters, 285 are in town camp dwellings. In effect, more than half the town campers ran out of money to pay for electricity. “When the power goes off, it is bad for our health, the food gets spoiled, we can’t wash our clothes and we can’t wash our kids,” Shirleen Campbell told the rally. “In summer, when our houses are hot or when we don’t have electricity, our people look for comfort in air-conditioned public places. We are not always welcome in these places and sometimes there are problems. We are thankful for places like the library and the pool.” Klerk says low-income residents shouldn’t have to go broke trying to keep their houses cool. “It’s not acceptable that people’s houses are making them sick, and something really needs to be done about it. It shouldn’t all be passed on to the consumer. “If it’s the case of people having to spend more money to keep the houses at a temperature that delivers health outcomes, then we have to rethink the levels of income support that are available to people, particularly in these regions where it’s so hot.” Predictions by the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress for the health impacts of heat are dire. In its submission to the NT government’s climate change policy discussion paper, it outlined some of them: “Increased sickness and mortality due to heat stress, increased food insecurity and malnutrition, increased risk from infectious disease, poorer mental health and an increased potential for social conflict.” ‘The antidote to despair is action’ The Pintupi-Luritja artist Irene Nangala was among the first to return to her home country at Kintore in the western desert, near the border with Western Australia, in the early 1980s. Until then, Pintupi people had been living a long way from home at the mission at Papunya, and they were homesick. Nangala helped set up the Kintore school. It was a “windbreak school” at first, she says: just a tarp to keep the sun and the rain water out. “Then we got a few teachers. It was hard work. We’ve got a proper good school now, proper shop. Nice clinic and aged care, child care.” Nangala says she doesn’t have an air-conditioner. On hot days the family puts blankets on the windows. Other elders whose aircon units break down have to wait for a repairer to come from Alice Springs, more than 10 hours’ drive away. “It’s really hot in Kintore. We can’t go and sit outside. We have to go at night to sit down with the families.” Nevertheless, Nangala says she does not want to leave. “We built up Kintore,’ she says. “People are really enjoying going back to their grandfather’s land. That’s the right thing to do. And it’s good for them to go back, the old people, good for the heart and the spirit. “When they went first, they cried, they missed that place for a long time.” Nangala says people don’t want to come into town, where life might be worse. “Climate change is true,” Nangala says. “They [politicians] got the map and weather things, they should see the temperature what is happening around Australia, it’s so hot.” Jimmy Cocking says: “We are walking blindly into the new climate reality. We’ve moved beyond hope, and we can’t be running on hope alone. “The only thing that is going to get us over the line is action. And the antidote to despair is action. “So there’s a lot of things that we need to be looking to change so that we aren’t going to be putting people’s lives at risk.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/aug/22/dont-phase-out-solar-panel-subsidies-sadiq-khan-urges-ministers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-22T17:11:33Z","webTitle":"Don't phase out solar panel subsidies, Sadiq Khan urges ministers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/22/dont-phase-out-solar-panel-subsidies-sadiq-khan-urges-ministers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/aug/22/dont-phase-out-solar-panel-subsidies-sadiq-khan-urges-ministers","fields":{"headline":"Don't phase out solar panel subsidies, Sadiq Khan urges ministers","bodyText":"Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has embarked on a lobbying drive to persuade the government to keep the subsidies for household solar power. Khan has made solar one of the key planks of his energy policy, supporting community solar projects and negotiating collective solar installations for homeowners in the capital. But that approach is threatened by the government’s recent decision to let solar incentives expire next March without a replacement. Shirley Rodrigues, a deputy mayor for London, said she had been very disappointed by the move. “We think the tariffs have been really helpful in increasing the take-up of solar and making it acceptable for people,” she said. The mayor’s office has written to Claire Perry, the energy minister, urging her to rethink the end of the feed-in tariff (FIT). Under government plans, householders with solar photovoltaic panels – which convert solar radiation into direct current electricity – will no longer be paid for sending their unused electricity (from the PV system) back to the national grid under the export tariff arrangement. Rodrigues said that that was unexpected and unfair. “At the very least, the export tariff should be kept for two years while we work out an approach that doesn’t result in installations dropping off and losing jobs [as] happened in 2015,” Rodrigues said, referring to losses after government cuts to the FIT three years ago. Londoners would miss out from ministers’ increased policy focus on large-scale, centralised, green energy over small-scale, decentralised, energy sources, such as rooftop solar systems, she added. The decision was contradictory given that the public had consistently shown that they wanted solar, Rodrigues argued. At stake is the future of the mayor’s Solar Together project, which oversees auctions where solar installers compete to offer the lowest price to a group of households who have shown an interest in the renewable energy source. The first round of the scheme cut the cost of installations by 35% on market prices and should lead to 600 homes being fitted with solar equipment by the end of the year. A second phase of householder applications closed on Wednesday, and the Greater London Authority hopes to rush those through before the FIT expires at the end of March 2019. Without the FIT, payback periods would be so long they could deter people from taking up solar power, Rodrigues said. London has consistently been the worst region in England for solar installations, a ranking that has not changed under Khan. But Rodrigues said the pro-solar stance of the mayor, who was elected two years ago, had made an impact. “The pace of change and action is radically improved,” she said. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “This scheme has been hugely successful, outstripping our predictions and generating enough electricity for two million homes. But it’s only right we protect consumers from costs and adjust incentives as costs fall.” Kate Blagojevic, head of energy at Greenpeace UK, said: “This is another blow to the solar industry from a government that seems determined to kill it off entirely, together with the jobs it provides and all the potential benefits of a 21st century smart grid.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/aug/16/capitalism-climate-change-risks-profits-china","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-16T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Capitalism can crack climate change.

But only if it takes risks","bodyText":"This summer’s heatwave has provided a glimpse of the future, and it is not a pretty one. On current trends, the years to come will see rising temperatures, droughts, a fight to feed a growing population, and a race against time to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. The struggle to combat climate change brings out the best and worst of capitalism. Decarbonisation of the economy requires alternatives for coal and cars that run on diesel, and that plays to capitalism’s strengths. Innovation is what capitalism is all about, and there has been staggeringly rapid progress in developing clean alternatives to coal, oil and gas. The cost of producing solar- and wind-powered electricity has collapsed. Great advances are also being made in battery technology, which is vital for the new generation of electricity-powered vehicles. Humans are endlessly creative. In the end, they will crack climate change. But by the time they do, it could be too late. Capitalism – especially the dominant Anglo-Saxon variant of capitalism – has trouble thinking beyond the here and now. People running big corporations see their job as maximising profits in the short term, even if that means causing irreparable damage to the world’s ecosystem. What’s more, they think they should be free to get on with maximising profits without any interference from politicians, even though the fight against climate change can only be won if governments show leadership, individually and collectively. The economist Joseph Schumpeter talked about the process known as “creative destruction” – the way in which inefficient producers are put out of business by disruptive new technologies and that, as a result, transformation happens. During wars, the best brains are employed by governments to produce more efficient killing machines. But normally creative destruction takes time, especially if the old guard can marshall sufficient resistance to change – something the fossil fuel industry has been adept at doing. It is vital that capitalism’s Dr Jekyll emerges victorious over its Mr Hyde. More than that, it needs to be an immediate knockout blow. In the past, politicians have only tended to focus on climate change when they think there is nothing else to worry about. Tony Blair, for example, commissioned a report from the economist Nick Stern into climate change during the years before the global financial crisis, when growth was strong and wages were rising. Margaret Thatcher only started to talk publicly about protecting the environment when the economy was booming at the end of the 1980s. When policymakers have other things to worry about, tackling climate change drops down the list of things to do. The Paris agreement in 2015, which committed the international community to restricting global warming to well below two degrees centigrade, shows that the issue is taken more seriously than it was two or three decades ago, but that doesn’t mean that it is a top priority. When times are tough, politicians are suckers for the argument that there is a trade-off between growth and greening the economy. There isn’t. Companies account for capital depreciation when they draw up their profit and loss accounts. If governments adopted the same principle and accounted for the depletion of natural capital when drawing up their national accounts, growth would be lower. In countries such as China and India – where the cities are dangerously polluted – it would be markedly lower. The good news is that in Beijing and New Delhi, policymakers have woken up to the idea that green growth is better growth. China is committed to phasing out coal, in part because it is worried about climate change and in part because it sees an opportunity to be a world leader in green technology. India, although slower to act, is also starting to take advantage of collapsing prices for electricity generated by solar and wind, and has set itself demanding renewables targets. But the bad news is that progress towards decarbonisation is still not fast enough. As things stand, fossil fuels will still account for more than 50% of energy consumption by 2050. CO2 emissions will carry on rising and global warming will continue. Stern says technological progress has been much faster than he thought possible when his report was published in 2006, and he thinks it is quite something that all the major car-makers now accept that the era of the internal combustion engine is coming to an end. “But the speed of action is still far too slow,” Stern warns. “Emissions have to be peaking now and turn down very sharply. We have not yet acted on the scale needed, even though the ingredients are there.” Winning the race against time requires political leadership. It means acknowledging that the Chinese model of managed and directed capitalism might be more appropriate than the Anglo-Saxon model. A massive scaling up of investment in clean technology is needed, because the $300bn spent on decarbonisation worldwide last year merely matched the cost of the losses in the US from climate and weather-related events. It also means scaling up the lending of the World Bank and the regional development banks to help poorer countries build wind and solar capacity. And a global carbon tax set high enough so that fossil fuels remain in the ground must be implemented. And, more than anything, it means accepting that the world needs to wage war against climate change. Powerful vested interests will say there is plenty of time to act, and they are aided by climate-change deniers who say there is nothing to worry about. These people need to be called out. They are not deniers, they are climate-change appeasers. And they are just as dangerously misguided as fascism’s appeasers in the 1930s. • Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2019/mar/25/dont-know-how-to-save-planet-this-is-what-you-can-do","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-25T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"Don't know how to save the planet?

This is what you can do","bodyText":"Do we all need to go vegetarian? Or vegan? Our food makes up something like a quarter of our greenhouse gas footprint, and at the same time as cutting this we need to feed a growing population better than we are doing now, while rescuing our haemorrhaging biodiversity and avoiding an antibiotics crisis. There is no escaping the clear evidence that humans need to reduce their meat – especially beef and lamb – as well as dairy consumption. When we feed a soya bean to a cow, we get back only about 10% of the nutrition in beef, and it comes with a hefty dose of methane (a powerful greenhouse gas) and very likely some deforestation. But there is no requirement for us to go all the way to either vegetarianism or veganism – it is all about the proportions. We do not even need to make all the changes overnight. We just need to start chipping away so that the proportions in our diets change radically over the next 10 or so years. And most of us can use this as an opportunity to eat more healthily. Is it OK to fly? Here is an inconvenient reality: a long-distance plane will typically burn though about 100 tonnes of fuel, turning it into almost four times that weight in carbon dioxide. Because of some complex high-altitude effects, the climate change impact of this is perhaps double what it would be if we burned that fuel on the runway. There are three options: biofuel (but the strain on our land is huge), synthetic fuels generated using solar power (but we already need all the solar power we can get), and fossil fuel counterbalanced with a mechanism for taking carbon back out of the air (but we do not yet know how to do this properly, and when we find out, we will already need to be doing this as fast as we can to mitigate non-flying climate impacts). Short-distance electric flights are almost becoming feasible but the need to save weight means that at the moment liquid hydrocarbons are the only suitable fuel for a long-haul flight. So, a bit of flying is still OK, but not as much. Is it realistic to transform our energy supply? Today’s global energy supply is only one seven-thousandth of the energy from the sun that lands on the planet. An area of solar panels 228 sq miles in a sunny part of the world could harness our entire global energy supply. Neither the cost nor the resource use is prohibitive. There are issues of distribution and storage, but the solutions to these problems are also coming along nicely. The precise energy mix – plenty of solar with significant bits of wind, hydro and tidal – will vary from place to place. Australia has 200 times more sunlight per person than the UK, which is the fifth worst major country in the world on the sunlight per person stakes (ahead of Bangladesh, Belgium, the Netherlands and Rwanda). But the UK has better wind and tidal potential than most, so its energy mix will be more complex. To summarise, the transition is technically feasible if we invest enough, cap fossil fuels and moderate our energy consumption. With the right investment (made possible through redistribution from fossil fuels, and through a carbon tax, say) it is totally feasible to replace our energy supply over the next three decades. Would a ‘green tax’ work? Somehow the world’s fossil fuel needs to stay in the ground. For that to happen it needs to be too expensive to extract. That requires a carbon price. I think the simplest way to achieve that is a carbon tax, although I would be happy with a cap and trade arrangement too – they have the same effect. A tax could be administered at the point of extraction, but it is also possible to levy it at the point of consumption – such as the household meter and the petrol station. What we are talking about is the creation of a huge pot of money that would fund the new green energy infrastructure, assist the countries and individuals that would otherwise stand to be losers in the transition to the low-carbon world, as well as support a suite of social and environmental goods. Should I have fewer children? Twelve billion careful people could live well together on our wonderful planet. One billion careless people can trash the place in no time. It is not just about the number of people, it is about how they live. It takes about 500 Malawians to clock up the carbon footprint of just one person in the UK. Every additional birth increases the need for everyone else to be slightly more careful. So is it bad to have kids? No. Is it responsible to have a big family? Perhaps not any more. Does it matter what lifestyle my children have? Absolutely. Is there really anything I can do as an individual? There are two aspects to the way people can make a difference. The first is to personally embark on more traditional low-carbon and sustainable living. It is still as important as ever because it brings integrity to everything else we do, it demonstrates commitment and, if done well, it makes it easier for everyone else to do likewise. The second is to push for the cultural and political change that we need, in every situation: how we influence our politicians (not just through our votes), and the things we say and do at work, at leisure and perhaps most challenging of all, at home. Grassroots pressure can change politics – the youth organisation Sunrise Movement has had remarkable success in pushing for the proposal of a Green New Deal in the US, forcing every Democratic hopeful to speak out on the climate. And two decades ago, the Jubilee 2000 campaign was widely credited with the cancelling of debt in developing countries. Is it time for more people to take to the streets? After decades of talk and negotiation on climate change, years of personal actions and corporate targets, a mass of rhetoric, greenwash and, to be fair, occasional flashes of sincere action from the business world, there has been no dent whatsoever in the rising global carbon curve. Nothing at all. Talking about it has not been enough. Asking for it has not worked. Somehow, we have to insist. I think it needs to be thoughtfully done. The tone needs to be constructive: it is a better world we are pushing for and certainly not a violent one. How and where to take to the streets must be a deeply personal decision. But given where we have got to, and I do not write this lightly, it has to be one that each of us carefully asks. Mike Berners-Lee is the author of There is No Planet B.

Having lived and worked in the American south, I can attest there are even more pernicious dimensions to this addiction to cold. Restaurants and bars are kept uncomfortably chilly, thus encouraging higher levels of consumption (heat dampens the desire to eat), fuelling not only profits but the obesity crisis. Cold has become a mark of prestige: the fancier the establishment, be it office block or shopping mall, the colder it is likely to be. Anecdotally, moving between these absurd temperature extremes several times a day seems to increase the incidence of colds. When I requested that the AC in my workplace (a public university) be set to a warmer level, the response of the facilities staff was to provide a heater for my office. Here in New York, a hotel on my street keeps a roaring fire in the lobby – in August – while the ambient indoor temperature is freezing. All this amounts to what Richard Seymour has recently called “climate sadism” – a form of masochism outwardly and ostentatiously directed, consumptive and destructive madness. May we find ways not to get caught up in its drive. Emanuela Bianchi New York • When I was a legal adviser to the Export Credits Guarantee Department back in the 1970s I was told by an architect that he had been retained by the ruler of one of the Gulf states to build a tower office block along the lines of those now disfiguring the City of London. He asked his client where he would like the power station as the block would consume inordinate amounts of electricity for air conditioning. The architect pointed out to his client that it would be more sensible to keep to traditional styles of building, like the medieval souks, which are kept relatively cool by judicious circulation of air. It seems that the architect’s advice was not heeded. We now have extraordinary developments such as Dubai, which must be consuming energy at a prodigious rate. Dr Anthony J Cooper Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire • Stephen Buranyi says “the warmer it gets, the more we use air conditioning”. He is right for the richest of us. Others have to cope with such temperatures, or die. The 1995 Chicago heatwave led to 739 heat-related deaths over five days, of the mainly elderly poor who could not afford air conditioning and did not open windows for fear of crime. Comfort really is a social construct. People adapt to those conditions they normally occupy, and if they become uncomfortable, they change themselves, or their environment, to return to comfort. In a world of rising energy prices, tanking economies, grid failures and more extreme weather events we have to think differently. Imagine a future where buildings are run for as much of the day and year as possible, on local natural energy, from sun and wind, and only when absolutely necessary are they heated and cooled. This is a revolutionary idea in societies where people fear crime and modern buildings are designed with too much glazing, and no natural ventilation and consequently overheat. For you, in your own home, my advice is to insulate your roof, shade and open your windows, and get security grilles for them. Only when this strategy fails, move rooms, locations or, in extremis, use mechanical cooling. Simples. Susan Roaf (Emeritus professor of architectural engineering, Heriot Watt University), Oxford • Your article does not mention the decades of scientific experiments proving we do not need AC, if we design or add the right construction. The Building Research Station in Watford has an experimental, comfortable, office block with no AC. It works by having a construction of exposed “high thermal mass”, solid plaster on concrete ceilings, floors, walls. At night cool air flows through to build up a store of “coolth”, so no noise, or bad air problem in daytime with windows closed. Usual office and modern home construction has the opposite of high thermal mass. The sun’s heat comes in and has nowhere to go but to raise the air to stifling temperatures. In the experimental building the windows are shaded to reduce over-heating, and the lesser heat soaks away into the heavy construction, leaving air at moderate temperature. The same effect is felt in solid brick or concrete homes. My own 1900 flat has been very cool all night and day with heavy construction, sucking away the heat. My son’s modern flat has been far too hot, with very high winter insulation, covered with only 1cm of plasterboard, nowhere for heat to soak away. Regulations are going to be changed to make low winter energy buildings cooler in summer. Anthony Edwards Retired architect, London • Stephen Buranyi’s article did not cover modern developments. In summer air conditioning can easily be powered directly by the sun via solar panels. In winter solar power stored in an electric car’s batteries can extract two and a half times more heat from the outside as used to power the air conditioner, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions from gas central heating units.

It wasn’t any of the individual leaders, who all put their best foot forward, though weren’t without their less appealing moments. It was the magnificent insufficiency of politics, all its conventions, all its rubric, in the face of this disaster. There is nothing like watching five people who fundamentally agree – who all believe the science, who all want to see children grow up into a liveable world, who all see this as the most pressing challenge humanity could face – try to suck endless arguments out of who believes it the most, and whose track record shows them in the best light, that makes you doubt our collective ability to fix this, or indeed, anything. Green co-leader Sian Berry was superb at points, but there was this lacuna where her honest opinion should have been. Maybe never before or after, but at this point in time, a serious Green would be asking people to stop a Conservative majority – which would not, even with Swinsonian delusion, involve voting Green, except in two or three places in the country. Jeremy Corbyn momentarily rehumanised himself by admitting that he was too miserable to turn the central heating on, but was forced by the invisible hand of political normalcy to attack the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon. Adam Price asserted Plaid Cymru’s determination to halt the third runway in Heathrow and HS2, which realistically they could only ever do as handmaidens to a Labour government, which will involve cooperating, so why not start cooperating now? Sturgeon paraded her green credentials as the party of government in Scotland, but it was ridiculous; of course she’s planted 22m trees and what’s everyone else done? She’s in government! Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson made her opening statement about Brexit, which far from sounding like a gestalt answer to all British politics, made her look as though she could only see any issue for its political advantage. They all say what we need is systems change, but their adversarial parade that stands in for discussion is one of the systems that needs to change first. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist Alice Bell: No one seemed to grasp the challenge of decarbonising heat Overall, it was a reasonably positive hour of political telly. There was very little point-scoring, and time to get into some juicy details without wasting precious minutes just shouting Brexit soundbites at each other. Still, the danger was that it would be boring. Do these parties have anything very much to argue about when it comes climate and nature? It turns out they did. Labour and the SNP both came in for criticism over airport expansion. Everyone wriggled a bit when it came to questions about food, seemingly scared of upsetting farmers and meat-eaters, and no one really seemed to grasp the challenge of decarbonising heat, or was willing to admit how disruptive it might to our homes or how much it might cost, despite some excellent probing from Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Plus there was the predictable spat over whether 2030, 2045 or 2050 was a good target for net zero carbon emissions (when arguably the important thing is what we do now). The other leaders ganged up on Labour a bit over nuclear. But the party that really needed more attention was the Conservatives. In fact it took nearly half an hour before anyone mentioned them. And as a result, their record wasn’t examined, and it needed to be. Ultimately, if Johnson wants to lead us through the vital next five years, we need to publicly scrutinise what he plans to do. In many ways the ice sculptures that stood in for the Tory and Brexit party leaders were genius, and I hope the image of them dripping haunts those who didn’t turn up. But I worry they left Johnson in particular off the hook. Channel 4 might have been better served filling his empty chair with a fact-checkers tasked with examining the Conservative record on each of the topics raised instead. • Alice Bell is co-director of climate charity Possible John Vidal: There was surprising harmony and politeness Hours after the European parliament declared a climate emergency, a day after scientists warned that we are close to irreversible climate disaster, and a week before the start of the most important UN climate meeting since 2015, the man most likely to be prime minister ducked out of a debate about what most people understand is the most important issue of the age. Well, wouldn’t you if you had shafted solar power, backed fracking, said concern for climate change was primitive fear, banned wind power on land and called young protesters “smug, irritating and disruptive”? It didn’t matter. His place was taken by a melting ice cube and his non-existence was treated like an embarrassing smell coming off the Arctic permafrost. Without Tory bluster, and with sensible questions from Krishnan Guru-Murthy, there was surprising harmony and politeness, with the five leaders often competing to agree with each other, with cries of “absolutely”, and “of course” – the kind you get from people who have just woken to the fact that buses, soil, trees and lagging is really, really interesting and important and that the fate of the world has been totally ignored for too long. Yes, there was old thinking. No one committed to ruling out new roads or airport expansions. Jo Swinson seemed astonished that houses in Yorkshire could be made warm in November without heating. Corbyn still warmed to nuclear. But there was much more of the new. Adam Price of Plaid Cyrmu promised to turn to reusable nappies and Corbyn promised to plant 2bn trees in 10 years. But the overriding impression was of leaders with a modicum of vision of a new industrial revolution, with new thinking about the land and a new agenda to push. “Is any of this real?” cried Krishnan Guru-Murthy. “It’s progress,” said Sian Berry, a Green co-leader, delighted to see her party’s ideas finally in the mainstream. But the ice cube had by then probably melted. • John Vidal is the Guardian’s former environment editor Ellie Mae O’Hagan: The leaders should have joined together to condemn the absence of Boris Johnson When writing snap reactions to political debates, one is usually expected to pick a winner. But I honestly couldn’t tell you which leader won the climate debate as it was so esoteric and interminably boring I found it hard to focus. It was commendable of Channel 4 to host a debate solely on the most important issue facing humanity, but the dry and complicated hour of television that resulted is emblematic of the problem with the mainstream climate debate as a whole. All too often, climate is talked about in terms of technology and policy, when in fact it is an issue of politics. The only reason we’re in absolutely dire straits now is because the people who had the power to do something sooner benefitted from keeping things exactly as they were. The debate failed to mention fossil fuel companies and the great campaigns of lobbying and misinformation they engage in. It failed to mention climate denial, and the fact that this is overwhelmingly a rightwing pursuit. The debate focused on minutiae to the point of absurdity. “My kids have never seen a hedgehog,” exclaimed Jo Swinson at one point. As for the leaders themselves, it was frustrating to see Jeremy Corbyn be intermittently denounced when the reality is that this election is our last hope to transition to a green economy, and he is the only person that can do it. The other leaders on the panel may not like that, indeed some of the audience may not either, but it remains a fact. The leaders should have joined together to repeatedly condemn the absence of Boris Johnson, who inexplicably sent his dad to do the debate instead, like some kind of chastened errant schoolboy. The real winners were climate activists, whose hard work and dedication created the demand for the debate in the first place. The political mainstream better learn how to talk about climate with the same clear-eyed urgency as them, for all our sakes. • Ellie Mae O’Hagan is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2018/dec/18/environment-jaffa-cakes-and-kylie-jenner-star-in-statistics-of-year","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-18T00:01:40Z","webTitle":"Environment, Jaffa Cakes and Kylie Jenner star in statistics of the year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/dec/18/environment-jaffa-cakes-and-kylie-jenner-star-in-statistics-of-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/dec/18/environment-jaffa-cakes-and-kylie-jenner-star-in-statistics-of-year","fields":{"headline":"Environment, Jaffa Cakes and Kylie Jenner star in statistics of the year","bodyText":"The environment, Jaffa Cakes and the reality star Kylie Jenner all feature in 2018’s statistics of the year. Among more serious statistics relating to poverty, gender equality and climate change, the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) highlighted the power of social media and McVitie’s slashing the number of Jaffa Cakes in its Christmas tube. Highly commended in the international category was the figure of $1.3bn, the amount wiped off Snapchat’s value within a day of a Kylie Jenner tweet critical of the platform’s redesign. The judges said that while a direct causal link could not be proven, it could be “the world’s most costly tweet”. Dr Jen Rogers, RSS vice-president and a member of the judging panel, said the number showed “the power of celebrity” and, ironically given the RSS’s raison d’être, how it was “completely at odds to using data to evidence decisions”. “It’s a very, very up-to-date modern statistic that shows the effect social media has in this day and age,” she said, “how this one tweet can have such a big effect. It’s astonishing.” The quirkiest statistic to make the highly commended list was probably the 16.7% reduction in the number of Jaffa Cakes in McVitie’s Christmas tube, which Rogers said highlighted the issue of “shrinkflation”, or “not getting as much for our money”. Arguably the most surprising statistic to make the list was the percentage of British retail shopping – 82% – that is still in-store rather than online. Rogers said the figure, which was highly commended in the domestic category, shattered “the illusion that everyone shops online”. The top prizes went to two statistics that highlight humankind’s relationship with the environment and attempts to avoid further damage to it. The international winner of statistic of the year was 90.5% – the proportion of plastic waste that has never been recycled. It comes after 12 months judges said had seen “unprecedented concern about the amount of plastic in rivers and oceans”. The UK winner was a more positive figure, 27.8%, the peak percentage of all electricity produced in the UK from solar power, achieved on 30 June thanks to a heatwave and nominated after being published in the Guardian. The figure meant solar was briefly the country’s number one power source, ahead of gas. Rogers said: “It’s a reflection of what are the important things facing us as a population. We are becoming more and more aware of these issues surrounding us like climate change, the relationship we have with the environment, the things we can do to help the environment.” Reflecting the dominance of environmental issues, the judges said they considered several statistics related to the country’s unusually hot summer for the UK award. While many of the statistics make bleak reading – including those related to the gender gap, the unpunctuality of British trains and the soaring number of measles cases in Europe – the 9.5 percentage point reduction in worldwide absolute poverty over the last 10 years provided some hope. It means the proportion of people living in such hardship has more than halved since 2008. Mona Chalabi, judge and Guardian US data editor, said that while it was important not to be complacent, “the halving of absolute poverty in a single decade is a stupendous achievement. So far we’ve heard very little about it. In the west we’ve generally focused on the bleaker situation closer to home.” It is the second year of the RSS awards, intended as the numerical equivalent of Oxford Dictionaries’ word of the year. More than 200 nominations were made by members of the public from around the world. • This article was amended on 19 December 2018.

Good morning, I’m Tim Walker with today’s essential stories. Trump describes whistleblower’s source as a ‘spy’ The whistleblower complaint over Donald Trump’s dealings with Ukraine alleges not only that Trump used a call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to “solicit interference” in the 2020 election, but that the White House tried to cover up the conversation. The complaint was released in full on Thursday as the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testified before the House intelligence committee on what he described as a “totally unprecedented” situation. The New York Times is facing a backlash for publishing details about the whistleblower that could reveal their identity. But Trump told US staff members at the UN that he wanted to know the identity of the whistleblower’s source, describing them as “close to a spy” and adding: “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.” Trump allies. Democrats have called on the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to answer questions before Congress on his department’s dealings with Ukraine, while Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and the attorney general, William Barr, are also implicated in the scandal. Ukrainian view. In Ukraine, the controversy has led many to question whether the US can be viewed as a trustworthy ally in the country’s attempts to reform and resist Russian pressure, as Andrew Roth reports from Kyiv. Fossil fuel industry more influential under Trump The fossil fuel industry’s bottom line has enjoyed a regulatory windfall under the Trump administration, not least the president’s unilateral withdrawal from the Paris climate change accord. That explains why Trump’s fossil fuel backers are already opening their wallets wide to help his 2020 re-election effort, reports Peter Stone. The coal magnate Robert Murray, for example, raised $2.5m for Trump at a single fundraising dinner in West Virginia in July. EPA threat. The Trump administration has ramped up its feud with California by claiming the state’s homeless crisis is causing increased water pollution, and threatening action by the EPA. Climate strike. Another wave of mass climate strikes are taking place around the world on Friday, including in Canada, Morocco, India, Italy and New Zealand. EU could drop nuclear deal over Iranian non-compliance The European Union has privately warned Iran that it will be forced to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal if Tehran makes good on a threat to take new steps beyond the boundaries of the agreement. Since the US exited the deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran, Tehran has taken three calibrated steps away from the conditions of the deal. Now it is threatening a fourth in November, at which point the agreement’s three EU signatories – France, Germany and the UK – say they would have to begin withdrawing, too. Tanker released. Stena Impero, the British-flagged oil tanker seized by Iran in July, is preparing to leave the port of Bandar Abbas, a month after the release by UK authorities of an Iranian tanker in the Mediterranean. Cheat sheet The Trump administration has set the cap for refugees allowed into the US over the next fiscal year at 18,000, the lowest number since the US began its refugee program in 1980. More than 350,000 people are expected to seek asylum in that time.

Opinion Liberal and conservative centrists are eager to oust Trump so they can return to the power they previously took for granted, argues Samuel Moyn. What’s needed is not simply impeachment, but an entirely new politics. Centrists simply want to return to the status quo interrupted by Trump, their reputations laundered by their courageous opposition to his mercurial reign, and their policies restored to credibility.

This includes claims by some electricity generators that we are heading towards a “solar peak” – a point at which “there is no point in putting any more solar power into the system” because it will just be spilled and wasted. Some are claiming it might even cause blackouts. Andrew Dillon, head of the Energy Networks Association, told the ABC’s 7.30 Report solar was likely to cause, “voltage disturbances in the system which will lead to transformers and other equipment tripping off to protect themselves from being damaged and that will cause localised blackouts.” This is all occurring within a furious battle over a recommendation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that by 2021 the federal government should remove the rebate provided to solar systems under the small-scale renewable energy scheme (SRES). So are we faced with a serious problem of there being too much solar which means we should scrap the rebate? Are we at risk of solar exceeding demand at an overall market level? Solar reached its peak level of penetration or market share in the national electricity market (NEM) on 10 December last year. The chart below illustrates the fuel mix of generation over each hour of that day. Solar peaked at 17% between 11am and 12.30pm and there was plenty of demand left keeping other generators busy. So what will things look like by 2021 when the ACCC has recommended scrapping of the solar rebate? According to the Australian Energy Market Operator rooftop solar will generate 85% more electricity than it did over the 2017-18 financial year. Meanwhile solar farms will supply around 5,000MW of power, up from just a few hundred megawatts in 2017-18. If we take last financial year’s data and then scale-up the solar generation levels in line with this extra amount of solar power we’d end up with an average daily time profile for the generation generation fuel mix illustrated in the chart below. This is assuming the extra solar power displaces the more expensive gas first and then less expensive black coal subsequently. Solar clearly will represent a very substantial part of our power supply, delivering a fifth of power during the daytime peak period of 9am to 5pm. But we’re hardly at risk of generating so much power from solar we’d have to spill and waste much of it. Rather it has done something very interesting. It creates a second off-peak period for power supply in the middle of the day, which replicates the kind of conditions power generators typically experience at about 2am to 5am. This is interestingly when wholesale power prices are usually at their lowest levels. Are we at risk of overloading the electricity transformers and blackouts? Solar systems, by injecting power into the network, act to lift voltages in the local area in which they are installed. But you needn’t worry about it overloading local distribution transformers, causing them to trip-off and cause blackouts. The output of solar systems is controlled by an inverter which continuously monitors the voltage of the network. In circumstances where the voltage is getting close to levels that networks deem too high, the solar system will either cycle its output or shut it off completely to prevent driving up voltage any further. But there’s something else you should be aware of: voltages on our electricity networks are being run at levels far above where they should be, which is 230 volts. University of NSW researchers, using 2,000 devices that monitor voltage in households across the states of SA, Victoria, NSW and Queensland, found that the typical voltage on the network tends to be close to 245 volts whether it’s day or night-time. They are only operating close to the standard of 230 volts for less than 1% of the time. This might be understandable in Queensland, which has only just recently adjusted its standard down to 230 volts, but for the other states this standard has been in place for a long time. In fact, Standards Australia agreed to move Australia from 240 volts to 230 volts in 1983. If the networks simply adjusted the voltage settings of their transformers to the standard they are supposed to be adhering to, then we should be able to absorb substantially greater amounts of solar capacity in the network. • Tristan Edis is the director of analysis and advisory at Green Energy Markets"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/mar/04/australia-news-updates-flood-warnings-rain-weather-nsw-queensland-scott-morrison-covid-coronavirus-omicron","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T07:55:06Z","webTitle":"Fifth death reported in NSW; ‘it’s climate change,’ Palaszczuk says as Qld death toll rises to 10 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/mar/04/australia-news-updates-flood-warnings-rain-weather-nsw-queensland-scott-morrison-covid-coronavirus-omicron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/mar/04/australia-news-updates-flood-warnings-rain-weather-nsw-queensland-scott-morrison-covid-coronavirus-omicron","fields":{"headline":"Fifth death reported in NSW; ‘it’s climate change,’ Palaszczuk says as Qld death toll rises to 10 – as it happened","bodyText":"With that, we will wrap the blog for the evening.

Here are today’s major developments: Alan Tudge will not return to the front bench before the election after the Thom Report found his relationship with former staffer Rachelle Miller did not breach ministerial standards. As clean up in the wake of the floods continues, the Australian Medical Association has released a statement calling for more to be done to mitigate the impact of the climate crisis. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she had “never seen so many natural disasters” and acknowledged - “let’s face it, it is (the floods) climate change”. The death toll nationwide has risen to 16. Rod Marsh has died aged 74 after suffering a major heart attack. Tributes have been flowing in for the Australian cricket legend. The federal Liberal party has released a statement confirming it will temporarily dissolve the New South Wales branch and appoint its own committee to take over, comprising of Scott Morrison, former federal Liberal president Christine McDiven and NSW premier Dominic Perrottet. They will remain in charge until 8 March. The Australian government is making preparations to impose sanctions on members of Myanmar’s military junta, amid sustained pressure from human rights groups. In Covid news, Australia reported 37 deaths today, the bulk of which were in Victoria. Some 26 people lost their lives to the virus in the state. And if we weren’t dealing with enough, there are now 16 cases of Japanese encephalitis under investigation in Australia as health authorities urge Australians to maintain vigilance around mosquitoes and pigs. Just how bad are telecommunications in the flood-hit northern NSW region? So bad, it seems, that NSW Emergency Minister Steph Cooke was unable to dial into the daily resilience/emergency response conference at 5pm this evening. Most calls have been at 8pm at the end of some long days, with some emotional outbursts. (Today’s call was more relaxed). Some 60,000 people in the area have been badly affected with a couple of thousand in evacuation centres. About 700 people from various agencies are on the ground, with formal “local recovery coordinators” to be appointed soon. Among the requests are fodder drops to help feed starving livestock and horses. Here is the full statement from NSW police on the sixth statewide death in the floods. A fifth person has been located deceased during the ongoing flood operation in Northern NSW. Shortly after 2pm (Friday 4 March 2022), the body of a man, believed to be aged in his 40s, was located at Byrril Creek Road near Terragon, south of Murwillumbah. The man is yet to be formally identified. Officers from Tweed/Byron police district have attended and established a crime scene. A report will be prepared for the information of the coroner. Just when you thought the rains might abate, the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting some fairly heavy falls over the Sydney region on Sunday and Monday. For Sydney, a relatively dry 6-15mm on Saturday shifts up a rain gear to 35-60mm on Sunday and 30-50mm. Richmond and Penrith, near where the Hawkesbury-Nepean River has been flooding these past couple of days, the forecast is for 10-20mm on Saturday with 40-70mm possible on Sunday. Monday trails off a bit, in the order of 10-30mm. Wollongong, too, may collect 40-70mm on Sunday. On their own, such totals would make much difference but the river will probably still be high even if Warragamba Dam, Sydney’s biggest catchment, has stopped spilling by then. The rain, though, looks likely to make its way inland a bit too, with Warragamba (only the eastern edge of the catchment, mind) may collect another 35-60mm on Sunday. Given how wet the catchment is already, all of that rain is will likely add to the already swollen inflows. My bet would be that it would spill again and prompt more flood warnings. Mercifully for the NSW northern rivers region, the forecast falls in places such as Lismore and Graftonthis weekend and early next week are less than around Sydney. A fifth death has been reported in the northern New South Wales floods. A man believed to be in his 40s was found at Byrril Creek Road south of Murwillumbah. He is yet to be formally identified. It brings the total death toll in the state to six with the death of the man on the central coast last Friday. In Queensland, three people have been charged with stealing by looting offences overnight as police target property crime in areas affected by the floods. Since the operation began on Tuesday, seven people have been charged in relation to 18 incidents. Acting superintendent Paul Austin said police were receiving reports of people scouting out furniture and belongings that had been left on nature strips. This is a timely reminder to all members of the public that often these are treasured possessions that flood victims are having to sift through. Please show compassion and consider asking permission from owners before assuming items left out in front of houses are rubbish. Trespassing on residential properties and taking items without permission is considered stealing and police will take action against those offending. The big clean-up continues. The Victorian government says there has been a rise in suspected Japanese encephalitis cases following the detection of the virus in Queensland. Since last week, there have been eight suspected human cases of JEV infection in Victoria, including six people who have been hospitalised – among them two children under 10. All cases are awaiting confirmation and several remain in hospital. Deputy chief health officer, associate professor Deborah Friedman, said the eight people all had exposure to mosquitos before they became unwell: It’s really important for people to protect themselves from mosquito bites, especially anyone who lives, works or plans to visit areas in northern Victoria where mosquitoes are prevalent, especially if they are camping. There are some really simple steps people can take, including covering up exposed skin, wearing loose fitting clothing, using repellent and sleeping under mosquito nets if you’re outdoors. JEV is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause encephalitis in approximately 1% of infected cases. Most people have no or mild symptoms but anyone who develops a sudden onset of fever, headache, vomiting, seizures or disorientation should seek urgent medical attention. Amid these seemingly endless weather warnings, this is an extremely powerful piece from Lismore resident Eddie Lloyd: We are at the threshold of climate catastrophe and it’s communities like ours that are bearing the brunt of it. It has not just lapped at our doorstep, it smashed right through our doors. It has destroyed our CBD and our loved ones have drowned to death. These climate catastrophes are going to happen more frequently, with more intensity, more damage and more deaths, and we will see more communities collapsing. Alan Tudge has confirmed he won’t return to the frontbench “before the election”. The Australian government is making preparations to impose sanctions on members of Myanmar’s military junta, amid sustained pressure from human rights groups to take a stand. More than a year after the deadly coup, the Australian government has quietly updated its sanctions regulations for Myanmar to add categories of officials who could face targeted financial sanctions and travel bans. The changes, taking effect on Saturday, will allow the government to impose sanctions on any current or former members of the State Administration Council, the military junta that is chaired by commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. The expanded criteria will also allow sanctions to be imposed on members of another body called the National Defence and Security Council, which is also controlled by the military. The new regulations also cover any other regime-controlled governance bodies and any political party or association that is participating in the regime. It is important to emphasise that this step doesn’t guarantee the Australian government will then impose sanctions – but it would be curious if it expanded the criteria in this specific way and then didn’t do anything about it. When asked for comment, Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch, said: It’s a welcome step for the government to create a clear pathway to sanction individuals and entities connected to the junta. Australia should implement targeted sanctions without delay; it has a lot of catching up to do with like-minded governments following the coup one year ago. Pearson said the government “should urgently sanction Myanmar’s abusive generals and military-owned businesses” because “depriving the military of its sources of revenue it the best way to maximise pressure on the junta to end its campaign of terror”. The Australian government has repeatedly said it has not ruled out expanding sanctions on Myanmar’s military figures, but it has sought to remain in close coordination with the the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) since the coup in February last year. Leaders in the region have become increasingly frustrated about a lack of progress in implementing Asean’s “five-point consensus” on resolving the crisis. Alan Tudge will not return to his post as education minister, Scott Morrison says, but a report into allegations made against him by a former staffer did not make findings that he breached the ministerial standards. Tudge was accused by former staffer Rachelle Miller of being emotionally, and on one occasion physically, abusive toward her during a consensual relationship they had in 2017, while she was a member of his staff. Tudge strenuously denied the allegations. Tudge stood down from the ministry in December and an investigation by respected former public servant Dr Vivienne Thom was launched. Miller chose to not participate in the report. Just before 4pm today, Morrison released a statement to announce the report would be released publicly this afternoon. He said Thom “had found that ‘the evidence considered in this Inquiry does not provide a basis for a finding that Mr Tudge’s conduct breached the Ministerial Standards’. I have accepted her advice.” However, Morrison said Tudge was “not seeking to return to the frontbench”, citing “the interests of his family and his own well-being and in order to focus on his re-election as the Member for Aston”. Stuart Robert, who has been acting as education minister, will continue in that role. The Thom report has been released on the website of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Rachelle Miller posted this on social media, minutes before the report was released: The prime minister’s office has released a statement on the Thom Report into Alan Tudge. Dr Vivienne Thom did not find sufficient evidence that Tudge’s conduct in relation to former advisor Rachelle Miller breached ministerial standards, however Tudge will not seek to return to the frontbench in the wake of the findings. Tudge admits to having an affair with Miller in 2017, saying he deeply regrets it and it contributed to the end of his marriage. Last year Miller said the relationship was defined by a power imbalance and alleged it was at times “abusive”, claiming Tudge once “kicked” her out of bed. Tudge has denied the allegations. The statement from the prime minister’s office reads: Earlier today the department of the prime minister and cabinet provided me with advice following the process undertaken in relation to Dr Vivienne Thom’s report into serious allegations made by Rachelle Miller regarding the then minister for human services, Alan Tudge. These allegations related to events in 2017. This process started in December last year, at my instruction, after serious allegations were raised by Miller that required a fair, independent and vigorous investigation by a qualified and independent person ... Miller and minister Tudge were invited to take part in this process by Dr Thom and the investigation was aimed at properly assessing views by a number of parties in relation to these issues. Ultimately, Miller chose not to participate in the inquiry but the inquiry was able to draw on her public statements ... Dr Thom found that ‘the evidence considered in this Inquiry does not provide a basis for a finding that Mr Tudge’s conduct breached the Ministerial Standards’. I have accepted her advice ... In December, minister Tudge agreed to my request to stand aside from the ministry, while these allegations were examined. Today he has informed me that in the interests of his family and his own well-being and in order to focus on his re-election as the Member for Aston he is not seeking to return to the frontbench, and I support his decision. Minister Stuart Robert will continue in his role as acting minister for education and youth and minister for employment, workforce, skills, small and family business. The report will be released in full, with minor redactions. Perrottet says the government will be doing “everything we can” to assist in the recovery, starting with the “immediate shock of the situation”. We are dealing with getting people back on to their feet and into housing. There is still a situation here with telecommunications - communications are down. I want to thank members of the SES here. They have done an absolutely amazing job ... they have been run off their feet, they don’t know what day it is, it has all become one. To hear the stories of the calls they have had to make, not knowing if the person they are speaking to at the other end is the last call they will ever make – it has been incredibly emotional. They remain incredibly strong. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, is speaking from Ballina now, providing a flood update. He reiterates the state “will get through this”, though it will be a “tough journey” ahead. He says the spirits of volunteers are high: What we have seen here in Ballina is the great Australian spirit. We have seen so many people come forward, whether they are registered volunteers, we [have] seen members of the public come together and lend a hand. It has been flat out here for the last five days. And it has been an absolute team effort. It is why we should be proud to be Australians, because of this coming together of community spirit and looking out for our neighbours and getting through – even speaking to many people that still don’t know if their house will be there when they get back, what the extent of the damage will be. The latest insurance figures for the current flood calamity in eastern Australia show the number of claims is increasing, but at a slower rate. According to the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA), insurers have received 67,537 claims, with about three-quarters from Queensland and the rest from NSW. Some 82% are for domestic property, with the remainder motorvehicle-related. “Based on previous flood events the estimated current cost of claims is now just over $1 billion,” the council said. S&amp;P Global earlier this week said the exposure to insurers could reach $2bn. Of course, with the rising cost of premiums, particularly for flooding, many of those affected will either be under-insured or not insured at all, so the economic losses will be higher still. Munich Re, the world’s biggest reinsurer (the firms that take on most of the risk from general insurers) also expects the event to be a significant one. Ernst Rauch, chief climate scientist at Munich Re, said the trend is towards increasing damage bills for floods down under. “The losses from flooding in Australia, both economic and insured losses, do show significant changes which actually started around the year 2008,” Rauch tells us. More from him later. Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 37 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 794 In hospital: 35 (with two people in ICU) NSW Deaths: two Cases: 9,466 In hospital: 1,000 (with 42 people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: seven Cases: 5,446 In hospital: 284 (with 25 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: two Cases: 2,047 In hospital: 106 (with nine people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 0 Cases: 937 In hospital: 14 (with 10 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 26 Cases: 6,545 In hospital: 245 (with 28 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 0 Cases: 2,137 In hospital: 21 (with no people in ICU) The flood clean-up in Queensland continues. The Victorian opposition have rejected premier Daniel Andrews’ wind targets announced today. They say the new environmental policy is a distraction from the pandemic. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, has responded to reports of shelling and fire at a Ukrainian power plant. Advocates for WA’s homeless have again raised alarm this week about the comparatively low vaccination rates for rough sleepers with the state’s hard border now down and vaccination rates lagging for that particularly vulnerable community. Guardian Australia first reported exclusively in January data from Homeless Healthcare that showed a third of the homeless community living on the streets in WA were completely unvaccinated. Updated vaccination data was released this week by Prof Lisa Wood from the University of Notre Dame in conjunction with Homeless Healthcare, showing the rates of vaccination among WA’s rough sleepers – about 41% of whom are Aboriginal people – are still well behind the state average: Wood said WA was also lagging in its Covid outbreak response: Other states with earlier peaks of Covid were much stronger on preventively getting people rough sleeping off the street to reduce risk of Covid exposure and transmission among this high-risk population. The data comes after representatives of the homeless community and their advocates this week wrote an open letter to the premier, Mark McGowan, urging the government to open hotels and provide accommodation to people sleeping on the streets amid ongoing concerns about WA’s homelessness crisis. There were 1,001 people known to be living homeless in Perth and Fremantle at the end of last year, according to the Zero Project – the same as a year prior – while the public housing waitlist has risen by more than 3,000 households to 18,388 in 12 months. The WA government indicated last month in parliament that hotel rooms had been purchased by the Department of Communities for people to isolate or recover from Covid if they had nowhere else to go. Many beaches across New South Wales will be closed this weekend due to erosion and hazardous surf conditions, Surf Life Saving NSW has confirmed. Some beach setup patrols and position rescue equipment remain shut off to clubs, while conditions remain dangerous for coastal activities including swimming, rock fishing and boating. Surf Life Saving says red and yellow flags will be down at a number of beaches: While riverine flooding in some locations is easing, the situation on NSW beaches is one of widespread erosion, damage to seawalls and access ways due to high tides and powerful surf. Hazardous surf, lack of access for rescue craft, coupled with the strain on volunteer resources due to the flood response, particularly in the north, means many clubs will not be able to patrol this weekend and beaches will be closed. Beaches closed include Sawtell, Coffs Harbour, Black Head, Stockton, Soldiers, The Lakes, Shellharbour and Gerringong due to the conditions. Some Friday afternoon motivational content: More tributes are rolling in for cricket great Rod Marsh, this one from former captain of the men’s Australian team Justin Langer. South Australia’s daily Covid update has just been released. There have been 2,047 new Covid cases overnight and, sadly, two further deaths. There are 106 people being treated in hospital with the virus, including nine people in intensive care and one requiring ventilation. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, and minister for emergency services and resilience, Steph Cooke, will visit Ballina this afternoon to provide an update on the flooding situation in NSW. We should be hearing from them both at 3.30pm. Unvaccinated members of the South Australian police force can return to work from Monday provided they return a negative rapid antigen test and wear a mask while on the clock. The below announcement came as Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, gave his first State of the State address to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia since December 2019: The state of our state is strong, because the people of our state are strong. We have been through so much as a community but through unity, by sticking together through untold acts of kindness and courage, we have been able to achieve something that is unique. We are one of the most vaccinated jurisdictions anywhere in the world. We have stuck together, and that’s why we can, with optimism and confidence, look to the future. But that future was never going to be easy, pandemic or no pandemic. Andrews went on to say the biggest drivers of growth over the next 10 years will be states and territories: The problem at the moment is that there is no national reform agenda coming out of the national government. It’s disappointing, but you cannot have a debate and the discussion about the future, without acknowledging that point. ... The levers that drive economies, that build infrastructure, that improve lives and create momentum, are now, in my judgment, all pulled by state and territory governments. Victoria has just launched Australia’s first offshore wind targets. The policy, announced today by the premier, Daniel Andrews, includes procuring projects that will generate at least two gigawatts of offshore wind by 2032 – anticipated to power 1.5m homes. The first power from offshore wind is expected from 2028, with targets of four gigawatts set for 2035 and nine gigawatts for 2040. Victoria is aiming to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Andrews said: What’s clear is that the transition to cheap renewable energy will only get done if it’s led by states and territories. When we came to government, Victoria’s natural ability to generate cheap and efficient wind and solar power was essentially untapped. It comes after the state government pledged $40m to fund feasibility studies and pre-construction development for three major offshore wind proposals in November 2021. Scott Morrison says Vladimir Putin will not be “dissuaded from his murderous acts” in Ukraine but that shouldn’t stop the rest of the world from “tightening the vice” on the Russian leader. The prime minister today raised “deep concerns” about the close alignment between China and Russia, and said it was important to send a “very clear message to anyone else, any other autocratic regime, and we know about a few of those in our own region … [to] not take the wrong lesson out of this”. Morrison told Perth radio station 6PR: If you seek to violate the international order – rules-based order – and the principles that underpin it, there will be a heavy transactional cost in reputation and in economic terms, and potentially even militarily. Morrison acknowledged there were differences between Taiwan – the democratically governed island of 24 million people that Beijing claims as its breakaway province – and Ukraine. But he also called for greater preparedness for potential instability in the Indo-Pacific region, after joining a virtual meeting with his counterparts from Japan, India and the US – known as the Quad – early this morning. Morrison said Quad leaders needed to realise “autocrats will pursue their agendas and won’t always play by the same rules as the rest of us and we need to be prepared”. He said he believed there was “a very clear understanding of what the implications would be if China were to seek to realise its ambitions for Taiwan”. The longstanding US policy is to support Taiwan’s self-defence – including by arms exports to Taiwan – and to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo. The US retains “strategic ambiguity” about whether it would come to Taiwan’s aid in the event of a military conflict. The Australian defence minister, Peter Dutton, was accused of going beyond the longstanding bipartisan position in November when he said it would be “inconceivable” that Australia would not join US-backed military action in the event Beijing sought to seize Taiwan. Western Australia has released today’s Covid update. There have been 2,137 new Covid cases overnight, bringing active cases to 9,660. There are 21 people being treated in hospital, none of whom require intensive care. There have been no further deaths. Clive Palmer claims he’ll launch legal action against Home Affairs minister, Karen Andrews, claiming she had spread “outrageous fake news” that he was buying Adolf Hitler’s car. That story circulated earlier this week, but Palmer denied it on Thursday, tweeting: “I did not buy Hitler’s car.” The United Australia party chairman said on Friday that he would take action against Andrews, and claimed to also have “taken extreme offence” to comments about the story made by Labor MP Patrick Gorman. Palmer accused opponents of “mud-slinging and pushing lies” about him. “These outrageous lies have caused considerable damage to my reputation and I will be bringing the people responsible to account through the courts,” Palmer claimed. We’ve contacted Andrews and Gorman for comment. Many thanks to Cait Kelly and all those who have manned the blog today. I’ll be with you for the rest of the day. You can tweet me at @caitecassidy. And with that, I am going to hand this blog over to Caitlin Cassidy, whose capable hands will take you through the afternoon. Finally, chief executive of the Australian Food and Grocery Council, Tanya Barden, is up. It is really critical that, first and foremost, we’re getting food and grocery supplies into these communities that have been cut off. So we’ve seen food and grocery manufacturers and retailers donating significant amounts of bottled water, grocery items, personal care, nappy, feminine hygiene [products] ... To get these products to communities in need, that’s our immediate priority. ... What I would say is that the food and grocery supply system has shown enormous resilience through the pandemic, through the weather events that we saw in the west coast. Barden added: I want to reassure consumers ... it will be some period of some disruption – there might be some products available in limited supply in some areas – but please be patient, recognise that the retailers, the farming community are working hard to get products restored and that that will happen. We’ve seen it happen again before. Have that patience and respect the fact that this will take a little bit of time, but we’re working with what is a generally resilient food supply system. Chief executive of the National Farmers’ Federation, Tony Mahar, just spoke. He says the agriculture sector has been hit hard across multiple industries. Everything in those two states have been impacted, and the cost will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars for farmers and businesses and importantly, the communities in which they are embedded ... are very small. So what we need from the government, and what we’ve mentioned and had great support from minister McKenzie [on] this morning, is immediate access back into those communities when it’s safe to make sure that people can look after animals and make sure people can get into their properties. That means access. Roads, infrastructure – it must be the immediate priority so people can get into those communities, get the food and fibre into supply chain and logistics centres so it can get to supermarket shelves. The third thing we need is skills. We simply have to have the resources. We have to have people in those communities that are going to help recover, help manage and help build back better these farm communities and farm businesses. So we’re still managing the impact. Jennifer Westacott from the Business Council of Australia is up now. Westacott says some supply chains will be impacted – some normal products may be missing from the shelves. Everyone needs to be chill about it and understand it’s because of the floods. Many businesses have been hammered. They either can’t operate, or many of their teams have lost their homes. We really put a call out to everyone to be patient about stock not being on the shelves, to show respect and courtesy to people in businesses because people are doing it tough. We now need to start working on recovery. The Business Council has started up its business rebuild again and that means we’ll be giving vouchers to people for their tools, for their office equipment, to get their businesses back up and running and making sure they can see the light at the end of the tunnel – they can get going again, get cracking again, get their shops open, get customers in the door. It’s very important at the moment that we give people that sense of hope, but we do continually call on people to be kind and courteous to people in the business community, because they’re doing it tough, and many of them have done it tough personally. McKenzie: And we know this is not our first rodeo as a country in this space. We know that this recovery will take time. What you’ve been able to see through ... collaboration between state governments and the commonwealth government and our emergency services and the ADF is swift support in a time of need, and then the ongoing rollout of support packages, which will not stop on this long road to recovery. McKenzie says the first food drop has been done in Casino. Thanks to Covid, getting access to cash and income and money when comms are down, when energy supply is cut off, is becoming increasingly difficult ... I want to hear from the banking sector more generally about what needs to be done, and how we can support them, and what are the issues that they’re hearing from the ground. We’ve also announced quite a significant package yesterday of ... support with New South Wales – including small business support, primary producer support, which was welcomed today by the agriculture industry – and grants to local councils to help them with the immediate clean-up. McKenzie says she has spoken to dairy farmers and food processors about the impact the floods are having. She says the event has shut down 10 meat-processing works which together process a quarter of Australia’s red meat. Then you’ve got the horticulture, everything from the magnificent macadamia and avocado industry to the grains industry and beyond. The impact on agriculture has been significant. [We have had] them around the table for their first, and I hope not the last, national coordination meeting so we can get support to the right places and spaces. Critical issues for agriculture this morning were infrastructure access to get back on farms to shore those animal welfare issues. We need to get fodder to animals quickly and they need access to vets. Many animals need to be euthanased, and it needs to be done safely and securely, and disposal of carcasses. Minister for emergency management, Bridget McKenzie, is speaking now from Canberra. We’ve seen 15 Australians lose their life through this event and we hope for the best but always prepare for the worst. As always in natural disasters in this country, there are also amazing stories of bravery and kindness, and whether it’s the ADF or the local SES rescuing anything from families with small children to animals from flooded communities, it buoys our spirits. Today, I’ve called urgent meetings with stakeholders from the agriculture industry. We know that, through Queensland and New South Wales, the range of commodity groups that have been impacted has been significant. The Australian Medical Association has released a statement calling for more to be done to mitigate the impact of climate change after the floods. AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said the widespread devastating floods in Queensland and New South Wales and the lasting impacts of the 2019-20 bushfires were more proof that climate change is directly affecting people’s health. More needs to be done to meet the challenges of climate change. There are practical and tangible things Australia must do to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Comprehensive short and long term planning is needed and preventative and anticipatory action is required over a reactive approach to climate change events. As doctors we see and understand health threats posed by climate change and Australians are experiencing these impacts on an increasingly regular basis. Khorshid said the AMA has called for immediate practical action, across the economy and including the healthcare sector, to start tackling climate change while graphic images of the devastating floods are demanding public attention. Events such as these devastating floods demonstrate that there is a real human cost to a changing climate. It should not be left to communities to respond to these events alone. We need a unified national approach to mitigation, preparedness and response to climate change events. Megan Whitaker, a resident of Lennox Head for 17 years, found herself in a strange position when the floods hit. Trapped in Melbourne as the waters peaked, Whitaker had to coordinate the rescue of her friend and her unconscious husband trapped on Tamar Street, Ballina. Calls to the state emergency service left her with little certainty about when they would get to the pair. The emergency services, she said, were clearly overwhelmed. She turned to local Facebook community groups, where she found a woman whose father lived in Tamar Street and was a surf lifesaver. He promised to take the surf lifesaving dinghy to evacuate the pair. They managed to, after a number of hours, evacuate the husband, who needed medical attention. But they didn’t have enough room to evacuate my friend and her dog. So I had to repeat the whole process about five or six hours later, when her battery was running low and the waters were potentially going to peak again. I had to once again call the SES, get through to NSW, post on a Facebook page. Her friend eventually got out and Whitaker has spent the days since acting as a conduit for communications between people in the area and emergency services. The ordeal has made one thing clear to Whitaker: the level of assistance and help being provided by the state and federal government in the area is woefully inadequate. This has been a catastrophic failure of government to provide the services we pay for as taxpayers. The impact of this is going to be so far-reaching, and for so long. I’m just so angry. Whitaker said it was clear the state emergency services were doing the best they could, but were completely overwhelmed. The federal government had acted far too slowly and not deployed enough resources, including Australian Defence Force members, she said. I understand that there were about 170 ADF [members] in Lismore to assist with the clean-up; there should have been far more. I understand that Peter Dutton said more resources would be diverted to the area, but when? It should have been done two days ago. Hello everyone, this is Cait Kelly. A big thank you to Royce Kurmelovs for blog expertise the past hour. As always, if you want to contact me, my Twitter is @cait__kelly. It’s going to be a big afternoon, so let’s get cracking. Warragamba Dam now is receding after multiple days over capacity. I will now pass over the blog to Cait Kelly, who will take you through the rest of the afternoon. Ukrainian women and children fleeing the war are set to begin arriving in Australia as early as this weekend, AAP reports. More than 1,000 people have been issued Australian visas since the war began according to the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, and many have fled to Poland and Romania. Federation co-chair Stefan Romaniw said he expects women and children to begin arriving within days. “Australia is 20,000 kilometres away, they’ve come from a war zone ... those children obviously have seen things. We have to deal with trauma, with families being disconnected,” he said. The federation has been preparing support for people when they arrive, including medical checks and accommodation, and links to welfare organisations. “We’ve got our finger on the pulse, we’re coordinated and we know what we’re doing ... As soon as they land, we will meet them at the airport and work out what are the next steps,” he said. It’s expected most people will land in Sydney and Melbourne, along with Adelaide and Brisbane. With that, I shall hand you over to the fantastic Royce Kurmelovs. See you next week! The wonderful Anne Davies has written more about the Liberal party takeover here: The federal Liberal party has released a statement confirming it will temporarily dissolve the New South Wales party branch and appoint its own committee to take over. This committee will comprise Scott Morrison, the former federal Liberal president Christine McDiven and the NSW premier Dominic Perrottet. They gain control immediately and will remain in charge until 8 March. The intervention ground is based on the circumstances that decisions have not been made in relation to the endorsement of three incumbent Liberal members of parliament as Liberal candidates to recontest their seats in the electorates of Farrer, North Sydney and Mitchell. Here is the full statement: In Ocean Shores, not far from Mullumbimby, Rosie Wild has lost everything. She tells the Guardian: Every single room is just totally flood-impacted. All of my furniture is gone. All of my white goods, everything. So the last three days, we’ve managed to get back in, and I’ve just had a team of people clearing the house. And I don’t know what to do about the walls or about the wooden floor, I’m not sure whether it’s going to dry, or not going to dry. Wild, like many in the area, is keeping busy with practical work: cleaning up the house, helping others, organising inspections. But in the evenings, her mind wanders. It’s all a bit devastating and personally, in the days, I’m just being strong, and just going and doing what I need to do and trying to be practical and get everything done. But in the evenings, it just dawns on you. It’s such a loss. The $1,000 disaster payment, she says, is laughably insufficient, given the scale of the damage. At the end of the day, it’s very, very disappointing. After I’d done my entire cleanup, I went back to my partner’s house, and worked out that all I was going to get is $1,000 ... I’ll probably have to out and get another loan. The coordination of the response has also been lacking, she says, leaving locals to rely on one another. The amount of care and community support has been absolutely incredible. Locals in the town of Mullumbimby in northern New South Wales are organising makeshift rescue teams after serious rain damage cut off roads to nearby hinterland residents. Pictures have emerged illustrating the extent to which the weather has damaged roads, upturned vehicles and left the Mullumbimby area in a state of ruin. On Friday morning, scores of locals gathered at the civic centre to volunteer their time and donate food. Volunteers are linking up people with similar skills, and are consulting whiteboards with a long list of properties where residents require help. While there is frustration among locals about government assistance, emergency services have also set up in town and are conducting operations. The town has been without internet for days, and is largely cash reliant and short of other supplies. In addition to being one of the few wifi access points in town, the civic centre can be used by displaced locals to find crisis accommodation. There is also free food. A fire has broken out in Europe’s largest nuclear power plant located in Zaporizhzhya, according to an announcement from plant employees and the mayor of the nearby town of Enerhodar. “As a result of continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is on fire,” the Enerhodar mayor Dmytro Orlov said on his Telegram channel, citing what he called a threat to world security. He did not give details, Reuters reports. Orlov recorded a short video message that has now been shared by multiple local Ukrainian media outlets, urging Russian troops to immediately stop shelling the plant. The official earlier said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city’s outskirts and reported that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant. Loud shots and rocket fire were heard late on Thursday. I’ll bring you any Australian reactions to this news, but you can follow the Guardian’s Ukraine conflict live blog below for all the breaking news updates. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the flood crisis in south-east Queensland and in New South Wales was “unprecedented”. Let’s face it, it is climate change. I have never seen so many natural disasters. We seem to be dealing with more and more. More cyclones, more floods. A couple of years ago – the commissioner and I were talking the other day – we had the catastrophic fire event in central Queensland – Queensland had never seen catastrophic before. But we are a great state, a resilient state. I tell you what, one thing is that people of this state inspire me every day – to see how they are getting up and getting on with things, you know, it’s, it is actually outstanding. A little bit more information on that Japanese encephalitis case. It brings the reported number of cases of the virus in humans in Australia to nine, after it was first reported in Victoria this week. Health minister Yvette D’ath said the confirmed case is in a person who works at a piggery in Goondiwindi. D’ath said: The confirmed case had recently travelled in regional southern Queensland and is currently being treated in a Brisbane hospital. This virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito, to people and animals. In animals, it mostly occurs in pigs and horses. Clinicians and hospitals have been asked to be alert to the possibility of the Japanese encephalitis ... Most human infections of this virus present with no symptoms or mild symptoms, such as a headache or fever. However, a person with severe disease may present with inflammation of the brain, characterised by sudden onset of vomiting, high fever and chills, severe headaches, sensitivity to light, neck stiffness and nausea, vomiting. Children aged under five years of age and older people who are infected with this virus are at higher risk of developing more severe illness. Queensland’s deputy premier Steven Miles said the state has asked the federal government to contribute 50% of the funding for a $559m small business support package, which will provide targeted support to flood-affected areas. The package will provide grants of up to $50,000, including a $15,000 upfront payment, and Miles said up to 6,100 organisations may be eligible. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk wrote to prime minister Scott Morrison on Thursday night asking for him to endorse the package. At the moment, it’s open to primary producers and sporting and community organisations. Miles said: We have allocated $257m in business support. We know businesses and organisations out there affected by this disaster are struggling and we want them to know that we will be there to support them and to support them quickly. To give them some sense of scale, this is the biggest business support package post-disaster since 2011. So it is a very significant investment. He added: Once the commonwealth has approved this category D package, we will be able to outline how small businesses and organisations can apply for the grants, and of course we will be there to assist them. The Bureau of Meteorology says the severe storms will be replaced by ordinary thunderstorms over the next few days, but that water is still falling on sodden catchments so there is a chance of further flash flooding. A spokesperson for the bureau told the Queensland press conference: Although there is a possibility of some severe storms today, they don’t need to be severe for us to see impact across the south-east. If we do see any severe storms, the predominate factor in the severity today is the heavier rainfall and damaging winds. We saw some hail yesterday in severe storms but that risk has reduced today and we are now focusing more on damaging wins and the possibility of heavy rainfall. The Brisbane River peaked at 9.1 metres on Thursday night and waters are expected to ease. And because Queensland likes to keep things interesting, there’s also a heatwave in the north. That will affect towns from Mackay to Cairns. The maximum temperature record for March was broken in Emerald yesterday, with 42.1C, and Mackay airport recorded 34.7C. One other person remains missing in Queensland. The death toll from the Queensland floods has risen to 10, after the body of a 53-year-old man was found under a wharf in the Port of Brisbane last night. The man was reported missing on Monday. Queensland has also recorded a case of Japanese encephalitis. About $2m in disaster support payments has been issued to people affected by floods already in Queensland, with more support to come, Palaszczuk said. That $2m has been paid out to 5,403 applicants. There have been 19,000 applications in total. Damage assessments are still under way. Some 140 schools have been impacted, 64 of which are government schools. There are still 16,000 homes without power – there were 180,000 without power at the height of the crisis. There are 260 people from the Australian Defence Force deployed to help with the flood response at Gympie, Ipswich and the Lockyer Valley, and another 142 people will join them tomorrow. Palaszczuk has apologised to Queensland parents for the warning she issued yesterday, asking people collect their children from school if it was safe to do so. That was off the back of advice from emergency and weather services, but the storm was not quite as damaging as forecast. Can I say from the outset, can I say to all of the parents in the south-east, that I apologise for the inconvenience but I think everybody would realise, if you were in my shoes and you are given the advice that was given to us yesterday, I think everyone would have taken exactly the same decision. But I do acknowledge there has been some inconvenience today for parents. But safety has to come first. At the end of the day, you can only act on the advice you are given and that advice given to me and to the senior management staff was that it was going to be very, very severe thunderstorms and hail yesterday. Thankfully that did not eventuate. In sadder news, another person has died in the flood waters in Queensland overnight. This takes the state’s toll from the disaster to 10. Palaszczuk said there were also two water rescues overnight. The Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is giving an update on the flood situation in Queensland now. The severe storm warnings have been cancelled and Palaszczuk says conditions are “easing, especially along coastal areas”, which means cleanup and recovery efforts can begin at first light tomorrow. Looks like we are about to hear from the Queensland premier, who is stepping up for a press conference after meeting with the state’s disaster management committee. Federal health minister Greg Hunt has posted about the passing of cricketing legend Rod Marsh. Labor senator Murray Watt has some harsh words for the head of the federal government’s recovery agency, Shane Stone, who has come under fire for telling the Sydney Morning Herald: “You’ve got people who want to live among the gum trees – what do you think is going to happen? Their house falls in the river and they say it’s the government’s fault.” Watt has posted on Twitter calling for Stone’s resignation, calling him “Scott Morrison’s mate &amp; hand-picked disaster tsar”. Here is a cleanup update from the Brisbane lord mayor, showing ADF troops that have been deployed to the area. Tasmania has recorded 937 new Covid-19 infections and an increase in the number active cases, AAP reports. Friday’s daily figure is a drop from the 1,117 infections recorded on Thursday, which was the first time the number had been four digits since 19 January. The state has 5,432 active cases, an increase from the 5,411 documented 24 hours earlier. Fourteen people with the virus are in hospital, with 10 of those being treated for Covid-19. Four patients are in intensive case, an increase of one. Tasmania has recorded 25 virus deaths since the beginning of the pandemic, with 12 of those occurring since borders reopened on 15 December. Marsh, who played 96 Tests for Australia between 1970 and 1984 and was regarded as one of the country’s greatest players, died in Adelaide on Friday. Morrison is on the mend according the 7 News. Australian cricket legend Rod Marsh has died, aged 74. The Sydney Morning Herald is reporting that the former wicket-keeper suffered a major heart attack last Thursday in Bundaberg. I will bring you more information shortly. Here are the latest figures on the scale of the Warragamba Dam spill, which contributed to the flooding of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River on Sydney’s western and northern fringe. The government says the peak flow over the dam wall was 315 gigalitres a day, and that came at 3am on Thursday morning – or about 24 hours after the city’s biggest dam started spilling. As of this morning, the flow rate was down to a rate of 128GL a day. Rainfall over the catchment also eased back and the inflows into the dam had dropped to 92GL a day. Most Sydney dams are still spilling (except Prospect, Fitzroy Falls and Wingecarribee) but all rates of spill are receding. As per yesterday, the city’s dams had just 2.5GL or so of “air space” ... which means they’re about as full as you can get. NSW SES commissioner Carlene York says her teams received 700 calls for assistance overnight and conducted 13 flood rescues: We are starting – have started yesterday in relation to doing our damage assessments and trying to get residents back into their homes and businesses back in so they can start cleaning up. There’s an additional 600 resources that have been sent up through police and emergency services to work with the existing large number of local resources helping the communities already. In addition, there are 280 ADF Australian defence force personnel pre-positioned and going into communities to assist them with the clean-up. There’s a lot of support, work, going up there as well as the local units part of the community, represent the community and are out there helping them clean up. So, again, based on the forecast from the bureau, we’re not passed the danger period yet. The rivers are very high, fast flowing, there’s a lot of debris and it’s dangerous out there. These thunderstorms and isolated heavy showers create an additional risk to the community. Dean Narramore: Further north around the northern rivers, we’ve seen water levels drop to minor at Lismore and slowly for Ballina but a lot of water through the river systems there. Moderate to major flooding will continue today and ease tomorrow. We could see showers and isolated thunderstorms up there, but they will be hit and miss, thankfully. Most areas should be dry but be aware this afternoon for the possibility of severe thunderstorms up in the northern rivers this afternoon and this evening. As we move through today, showers also continue from the Illawarra to the Hunter. They will be brief and isolated but with brief bursts of rainfall that’s heavy. The next system tomorrow will move in. We will see showers and thunderstorms through the Riverina, into the tablelands, Canberra and the south coast Saturday. There will be showers and thunderstorms. We have a few minor flood warnings on the Bega River. The shower and thunderstorm activity is likely to be widespread Sunday and include the Illawarra, the Central Coast, into the Hunter. There could be widespread areas of rain associated with this, particularly some guidance is hinting to another low-pressure system along the New South Wales coast Sunday to Monday. Here in New South Wales, the low-pressure systems are dynamic, so where other areas of heavy rainfall will fall, we won’t know yet but we are looking at widespread showers and thunderstorms across eastern Australia, from the mid-north coast all the way down to the Victorian border and inland on Sunday and Monday. Let’s jump over to the NSW Bureau of Meteorology’s Dean Narramore to get an update on the flooding situation across the state: As we mentioned yesterday, the focus on the heavy rain was around the Hunter region last night and early this morning. Rain has eased through there, but we saw widespread 50mm to 100mm, with some isolated totals near 200mm around the Barrington Tops. Because of the rainfall we had moderate to major flooding on rivers across the Hunter. The Paterson Williams River is in moderate flood and we could see major flooding on the Gloucester River late this morning into the early afternoon. We could see moderate flooding at towns of Wingman and Taree. Further south, through the Hawkesbury and Napean catchment, we’ve seen the rivers on the Nepean River slowly fall overnight but there’s still moderate flooding at many locations. On the Hawkesbury River, we’re experiencing major flooding on North Richmond and it looks like the water peaked around Windsor just below the major flood level. There’s a lot of water in the catchments. It will take a while to slowly fall, particularly with showers continuing through today and tomorrow. Queensland has announced its first human case of Japanese encephalitis virus, as health officials investigate dozens of other potential cases across Australia, AAP’s Emily Woods reports. On Thursday night, Queensland Health confirmed the infected person is being treated in a Brisbane hospital and had travelled to regional southern Queensland. Overall, there are 16 cases of encephalitis “of unknown cause” under investigation across NSW, Victoria and South Australia, a federal Department of Health spokesperson said. The news comes after Victorian health authorities confirmed four suspected cases of JEV, believed to be the first in southern Australia, connected to a piggery near Echuca in the state’s north. All four were admitted to hospital and one has since been discharged. Federal, state and territory authorities are meeting regularly to discuss next steps as the disease continues to spread. This week health warnings were issued in several states after the disease was found in one piggery in Victoria’s north, six piggeries in NSW and one in Queensland. Japanese encephalitis virus spreads through mosquito bites and people in regional areas who are in contact with pigs may be at particular risk. Two vaccinations are available for protection against JEV in Australia, with older people and those aged under five at a higher risk of developing a serious illness. The disease is not transmitted from person to person and cannot be caught by eating pork or pig products. Anyone who works with pigs or horses, even if they’re backyard pets, is urged to keep an eye out and report any possible signs of the disease. People living in high mosquito areas encouraged to use repellent containing picaridin or DEET and to cover up with loose-fitting clothing. The Greens are calling for disaster payments to be doubled in the wake of the devastating NSW and Queensland floods. Scott Morrison met virtually with the other Quad leaders overnight to discuss the Ukraine conflict. It seems the main thing to come out of that is Australia restating its disapproval of Vladimir Putin’s actions. Here is the prime minister’s full statement: Victoria’s Covid death toll is once again in double digits today, with 26 Covid-19 positive people dying in the last 24 hours. Just in case you were wondering how the beaches on the NSW south coast were faring after all this wild weather: The last thing Krystle Henry and Matt Bridges thought they would be dealing with in the hours before the birth of their son was a complex logistical problem caused by catastrophic flooding across the state of Queensland. Roughly 24 hours before a scheduled caesarean at Brisbane’s Mater Mothers’ hospital, the family woke up on Monday to find themselves cut off by flood waters. Though their two-year-old daughter had been thrilled at the unfolding crisis, Bridges said the water came as a shock: The floods really snuck up on us. There was heavy rain on Saturday night, then we went to get coffee – our last as a family of three – on Sunday morning. We went to the bottom of the road and it was cut off. On both ends. You can read the full report below: Mehdi is free. After nearly nine years in Australia’s immigration detention system, Mehdi Ali has flown out of the country to be resettled in the US. Mehdi – who this year became the public face of, and a powerful advocate for, the refugees and asylum seekers detained in Melbourne’s Park Hotel – arrived in Australia as a 15-year-old seeking sanctuary. A member of Iran’s routinely persecuted Ahwazi Arab minority, he was sent to Australia by his family, arriving by boat with his cousin, then 16-year-old Adnan Choopani, in 2013. Mehdi was sent to Australia’s detention centre on Nauru, an experience that was, in his words, “a complete trauma”. He watched, helpless to intercede, as a fellow refugee burnt himself to death, he was beaten by guards employed to protect him; and jailed without charge. The school he went to, the one light in a dark existence, was suddenly shuttered. You can read the full story below: The commonwealth is working with Queensland to deliver further support to flood-affected areas, asking the state government for a list of projects where funding is required to rebuild, reports AAP. It comes as the federal government announced a joint $435m support package with NSW on Thursday, with a second package in the works. The package includes grants of up to $75,000 for primary producers and up to $50,000 for small businesses and not-for-profit organisations. Large parts of Queensland and NSW remain underwater after heavy rain and flash flooding over the preceding days. South-east Queensland is on alert for life-threatening floods from dangerous thunderstorms after deluges killed nine people and damaged more than 17,000 properties in the state. In NSW, greater Sydney, the Central Coast, south coast and the Hunter region also remain on alert for more flooding. The clean-up continues on the state’s north coast in cities including Lismore, which was hit by the region’s worst floods on record. Shortages of critical supplies like food, fuel and fresh water also remain. Supply chain problems caused by rising water blocking critical road and rail links led to Scott Morrison convening a roundtable with key ministers and officials on Thursday. Defence chief Angus Campbell, emergency management minister Bridget McKenzie and disaster assistance coordinator Joe Buffone attended. Since the flooding disaster, $62.7m in disaster recovery payments have been provided in response to 52,000 claims lodged with the federal government. Resilience NSW commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons has told ABC radio that flooding across the state was worst than predicted: Unprecedented levels [of flooding] experienced up in northern NSW, flood levels that came in well above what was forecasted … And at the same time we’ve still got serious flooding concerns in Hawkesbury and Nepean ... We’ve also formed up a significant taskforce, comprising of firefighters … the Australian defence force. So working shoulder to shoulder with business owners, with property owners, homeowners ... In the last few months, we’ve had more than 70 LGAs … in NSW, declare natural disasters because of storms and floods. A harsh sun shines down across the still partially flooded Lismore, spreading the smell of mud and sewage in the humid air, as Mark Bailey holds an album of vintage East German stamps that is dripping brown. “Everything in there’s fucked,” he says as he hurls it on to a pile of ruined goods and furniture he had been amassing at the front of his store, just like many other shop owners along Molesworth Street in the centre of town. While each pile looks a similar shade of brown, the muddied faces of Queen Elizabeth, Karl Marx, Michael Jordan and gold prospector Edward Hargraves on loose stamps, faded banknotes and sports cards are visible up close. Bailey believes the collectibles in his pile are worth about $5m, at least they were, before flood waters rose above the ceiling of The Penny Man – the shop he manages as a partner – this week. Now, he will throw everything out, save for some antique items he believes he can salvage. You can read the full report below: Mehdi Ali, an Iranian man who was held in Australian immigration detention for nine years despite being found to be a genuine refugee by law, has been freed and is able to move to the US. Ali’s story become widely known after tennis star Novak Djokovic was placed in the same Melbourne hotel-turned-detention centre after arriving in Australia without the proper vaccination exemptions. Ali announced the news via his Twitter last night. Tonight I am free and leaving Australia to start my life in the United States of America. But I won’t be happy until all my friends are get released from detention. It’s not freedom until we are all free. Thank you all for your support. The NSW government’s response to the unprecedented flooding on the north coast has come under fire from Greens and Labor MPs. Greens MP Tamara Smith is dismayed by the lack of coordination among government relief agencies, relying on a local armada of as many as 150 private boats to rescue stranded people and deliver supplies five days after rivers broke their banks: The anger is palpable. It’s like, what’s the use of governments if they can’t support people at these pointy moments? Evening conference calls with emergency services have left locals “absolutely frustrated”, Smith says. Concerns ranged from empty shops to a helicopter being used to deliver medicine to a single person because other needs weren’t known or catered for. Ballina shire has just 18 SES volunteers for 32,000 people. Once you go out into the hills, you’re basically cut off, you’ve got nobody there. Lismore, a flood-prone town that beat its previous record flood by 2m, is struggling to find homes for evacuees. About 800 people have been temporarily located at the local campus of Southern Cross University, according to Labor MP Janelle Saffin. The Greens have called for a permanent rapid response team to be set up to respond to disasters, a proposal Saffin supports in light of the difficulties she is seeing on the ground: We need rapid response. And also, if things can’t be done, we need to tell people and tell them why. During the height of the crisis, Saffin had to swim from the house she was staying at, while her husband also had a narrow escape: There was no one to rescue him but ended up getting into a private boat just before he drowned. The big flood threat to Sydney and its surrounds has only complicated efforts. Challenges for many people include obtaining food and the fuel needed to secure essential supplies. Both Ampol and BP blamed access problems rather than a supply shortage. Flooding and road closures were making it difficult to reach retail outlets, both companies said, with a number of service stations forced to close. Ampol shut five retail stores across the northern regions and north coast, including both its stores in Lismore, adding a “number of our employees have been directly impacted”. It said it was working directly with emergency services to maintain adequate supplies. BP said it was “working closely with partners and local authorities to navigate the impacts of the weather”. Ballina mayor Sharon Cadwallader said emergency services in her area had managed to secure an emergency fuel from one local service station. The outlets that did have fuel were unable to use cards and the stations were out of cash. “I’m not aware that we’ve had any fuel supply whatsoever,” she told Guardian Australia, adding that food was running low, including in evacuation centres. We managed to get a canoe to get some food supplies out of one of the charities that wasn’t affected – well, it was affected, but a lot of product wasn’t. So that was good. The industry peak group, the Australasian Convenience and Petroleum Marketers Association, described the damage to outlets as “unprecedented” . Chief executive Mark McKenzie told the ABC: There are service stations where the water is basically to the top of the canopy. It’s going to be some time in those areas before we can get fuel flowing again. Guardian Australia contacted the NSW premier Dominic Perrottet’s office and Resilience NSW for a response. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Friday. We’ve nearly done it! It’s Matilda Boseley here but first up we actually have special guest Peter Hannam to bring you the latest flood updates: Almost 400,000 people in NSW remain under evacuation warnings or orders on Friday morning as rain starts to dissipate but rivers in some areas remain at major flood levels. Almost 94,000 people are covered by 69 evacuation orders with a further 287,000 residing in areas where evacuation warnings are in place, an NSW SES spokesperson said. The latest of these is an evacuation order for low-lying parts of Gloucester, where officials say rising flood water could soon impact homes. The SES has lifted a dozen evacuation orders, allowing 18,633 people to return to their homes. The Hawkesbury-Nepean River on Sydney’s north and western fringe “is still a major concern”, the spokesperson said. As of Friday morning, major flooding was still happening at North Richmond. At Windsor, the river level remained just below major flooding levels. The outlook, while improving in the near term, includes more rain over flood-hit areas of eastern Australia, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Up north of the border, a number of schools in Queensland’s south-east will remain shut on Friday as the area braces for more severe thunderstorms and torrential rain. Totals of between 20mm and 80mm are expected as a trough lingers over the south-east, with high-intensity rainfall and totals of 150mm or greater expected in isolated areas. The bureau has predicted flash flooding and minor to major flooding across areas in the south-east, stretching from Brisbane’s north to Bundaberg. With all that in mind, why don’t we jump right into the day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/sep/18/un-secretary-general-climate-crisis-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-18T11:54:17Z","webTitle":"'We're losing the race': UN secretary general calls climate change an 'emergency'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/18/un-secretary-general-climate-crisis-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/sep/18/un-secretary-general-climate-crisis-trump","fields":{"headline":"'We're losing the race': UN secretary general calls climate change an 'emergency'","bodyText":"The UN secretary general says that he is counting on public pressure to compel governments to take much stronger action against what he calls the climate change “emergency”. “Governments always follow public opinion, everywhere in the world, sooner or later,” António Guterres, said on Tuesday in an interview with Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets, led by Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation, in partnership with the Guardian. Guterres, a former prime minister of Portugal, added: “And so … we need to keep telling the truth to people and be confident that the political system, especially democratic political systems, will in the end deliver.” Guterres refused to comment on Donald Trump and the Trump administration’s hostility to climate action, but a CBS News poll released on 15 September found that 69% of Americans want the next president to take action, while 53% say such action is needed “right now”. Guterres said that “it would be much better” if the US was “strongly committed to climate action”, just as it would be better if Asian countries [notably, China and Japan] stopped exporting coal plants. Until then, he said, “what I want is to have the whole society putting pressure on governments to understand they need to run faster. Because we are losing the race.” With five days remaining before the UN climate action summit on 23 September, the secretary general cited the “fantastic leadership” of young activists as a leading example of how civil society can pressure governments to honor the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit temperature rise to “well below” 2C and preferably to 1.5C. Recent election results across Europe – where green parties gained significant public backing – also left Guterres optimistic that at next Monday’s summit the European Union will announce that it promises to be “carbon neutral” by 2050, as the Paris Agreement mandates. “Nature is angry,” said Guterres, who recently returned from a visit to the Bahamas, where Hurricane Dorian unleashed what he called “total destruction”. He further cited ferocious drought in Africa, melting glaciers, bleaching coral reefs, the hottest month in recorded history last July, and potential future sea level rise of 10 to 20 meters (33 to 66ft) as evidence that, “You cannot play games with Nature. Nature strikes back.” Don’t bring a speech – bring a plan, Guterres famously told heads of state and government in the months leading up to this summit, and it appears that only leaders who followed his instructions will be allowed to speak at the plenary session. To gain a slot, a country had to commit to doing one of three things, said UN officials: be carbon neutral by 2050; “significantly” increase how much it will cut emissions (or, in UN jargon, significantly strengthen its Nationally Determined Contribution); or make a “meaningful” pledge to the Green Climate Fund, a pool of money provided by wealthy countries to help developing countries leave fossil fuels behind and increase their resilience against climate disruption. UN officials expect that 60 to 70 countries will have made sufficiently solid commitments by next Monday that their leaders will be invited to outline their country’s plans from the dais, with each leader granted a mere three minutes to speak. While emphasizing that he had no desire to intervene in the 2020 US presidential election, Guterres spoke positively about a proposal by a leading Democratic candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders, for a Green New Deal that would be global. Most of the leading Democratic presidential candidates endorse one form or another of Green New Deal, a program in which the US government would create millions of jobs by investing in solar power, energy efficiency and other measures to reduce heat-trapping emissions. But a new report by the Nation magazine pointed out that only Sanders’ Green New Deal meets the scientific imperative of cutting global emissions by 45% by 2030 on the way to carbon neutrality by 2050. Sanders’ Green New Deal does this by pledging not only to slash emissions in the US but to help developing countries cut their emissions as well. “The Paris Agreement was very clear,” said Guterres. “There was a commitment by the developed countries to mobilize $100bn per year, from private and public sources, to support the developing world both in mitigation [ie, reducing emissions] and adaptation [preparing against impacts]. Obviously, it is essential that all countries, including the United States, play a role in relation to this.” Rich and poor countries have wrestled with the question of whether and how much financial assistance the rich should give the poor ever since governments first began debating the climate problem at the UN “Earth Summit” in 1992. The poor argue that the rich countries’ emissions are the foremost cause of global warming and climate disruption, while poor countries are the ones that suffer most of that disruption. Rich countries generally do not dispute those facts, and have given lip service to providing assistance, but actual contributions have been modest. The US, for example, has contributed only $1bn, and the Trump administration blocked any additional contributions. Guterres said in the interview that “of course” he was aware of the global dimensions of Sanders’ Green New Deal, and he added that, “Any attitude from a country like United States to increase … finance to the developing world would be of course welcome.” As required by UN protocol, the secretary general was careful to add, “That doesn’t mean that we want to interfere in the American election.” As a former elected official himself, Guterres also emphasized the need for governments to show the public that climate protection need not mean economic hardship. The secretary general advocates in particular climate-smart tax reform: reducing taxes on people’s incomes while increasing taxes on heat-trapping emissions. “If I [as a politician] take money from you with an increased carbon tax but I give you nothing in return, people will be against [it],” said Guterres. Although rarely described this way, corporate subsidies for production of fossil fuels are also a form of tax. “Let’s be clear: subsidies are paid with taxpayers’ money,” he said, adding with a smile, “I really do not like to see my money as a taxpayer going to bleach corals and melt glaciers.” Guterres disputed a common criticism of a Green New Deal – that it will cost too much – by turning the question around. “What is the cost of the consequences of taking no action?” he asked. Depending on what governments do at the climate action summit next Monday, and are pressured to do by civil society in the weeks and years to come, the world may learn the answer to that question soon enough.

He thought this future was four hundred years away, but the so-called “hydrogen economy” may arrive a lot sooner thanks to a recent burst of innovations in hydrogen generation, storage, transport and use. And it could open a new energy export market for Australia. Hydrogen itself isn’t actually a fuel – it’s an energy carrier. The gas is produced by splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen by the electricity-driven process electrolysis. That hydrogen is then condensed under pressure and at very low temperatures into a liquid, which can be used in much the same way as petrol and diesel, or it can be used in fuel cells to generate electricity. The conversion of that solar, wind or water energy into liquid hydrogen also enables it to be transported to where it is needed, which in most countries in the world is a reasonable distance away from where the energy is generated in the first place. Hydrogen’s greatest asset is its potential to be the ultimate source of clean energy. “The ability of hydrogen is it does not emit carbon dioxide when it is burned,” says Prof Dongke Zhang, director of the University of Western Australia’s energy centre. Therefore, if hydrogen can be produced using only energy from renewable sources, such as wind, solar, or hydro, then we don’t have to worry about carbon dioxide production at all. The fortunes of hydrogen have waxed and waned over the past few decades. Interest first boomed in the 1970s in response to the oil crisis, then dropped as the crisis eased. Then the looming threat of climate change and peak oil drove a resurgence of interest in the early 2000s that – apart from a slowdown during the global financial crisis and Australia’s resources boom – has seen a concerted government and research focus on hydrogen. As well as being a clean energy source, hydrogen also offers at least the same bang for buck as petroleum or diesel, says RMIT’s Prof John Andrews. “In the automotive area, what hydrogen offers is a vehicle with a range equivalent to today’s petrol and diesel vehicles,” says Andrews. “For the five kilograms of hydrogen stored on board, there’s a range of up to 600km between refuelling.” Hydrogen-fuelled cars have the added advantage of potentially taking a far shorter time to refuel – as little as five minutes with compressed high pressure gas – compared with an electric vehicle, which might need six to eight hours to recharge, he says. Andrews also sees hydrogen being used to store excess electricity at the grid, or even the individual household, level. “So you have excess electricity fed into an electrolyser, produce hydrogen, compress it or store it in some way and then when you want to get the energy back you put it into a fuel cell and then back to the grid.” So why isn’t the hydrogen economy already here? Zhang says part of the problem is infrastructure. “Hydrogen is a wonderful thing but we can’t just overnight change from burning natural gas to burning hydrogen, and we can’t stop our petrol and diesel cars and start to use hydrogen,” he says. Using hydrogen on a large scale – either for electricity generation or transportation fuel – requires significant infrastructure investment; for example in hydrogen fuelling stations. Zhang points out that Australia’s geography and scattered population makes that an expensive prospect, at least for the time being. Because of this, some are focusing on the perhaps more achievable prospect of Australia becoming an exporter of energy in the form of hydrogen. Dr Michael Dolan, principal research scientist at CSIRO, says this is an attractive scenario because Australia has such an enormous capacity to generate renewable energy compared to a country like Japan, which has limited free land and sunshine. “Somewhere like the Pilbara, for example, is considered the world’s best solar resource in terms of the intensity of the sunlight and the fact that it’s never cloudy,” Dolan says. “That means you can potentially set up a big solar farm there, or wind farms along the coast, or even hydro from Tasmania, then you need to get that renewable energy to Japan.” Hydrogen can serve as an “energy vector” to transport solar photovoltaic energy from the Pilbara to the fuel tank of a hydrogen-powered car on the streets of Tokyo. But there is still the challenge of getting the hydrogen to Japan. One option is to compress it into liquid form, but this requires the gas to be cooled to around -250C, which is energy intensive. Another option is to combine the hydrogen with nitrogen to make ammonia. It’s a technique that is well-established, and has been done on an industrial scale for nearly a century, Dolan says. Ammonia can be compressed into a liquid at much more moderate temperatures, and is relatively easy to transport. Indeed in January 2017, Australia and Japan announced safety standards for shipping liquid hydrogen in bulk for the first time. What was missing – until recently – was the technology to extract the hydrogen back out of the ammonia at the other end of the export equation. However CSIRO recently announced the establishment of a pilot plant to test technology that can refine a 100% pure stream of hydrogen from gasified ammonia using a metal membrane. The pilot will start by generating just five kilograms of hydrogen a day from ammonia, but it is hoped this proof of concept will be the last link in the chain exporting Australian sunshine to Japanese, Korean or even European shores."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"music/2019/jun/23/green-music-festivals-eco-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-23T06:00:52Z","webTitle":"Tents, toilets, transport: eco-friendly festivals tackle the unholy trinity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/23/green-music-festivals-eco-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2019/jun/23/green-music-festivals-eco-environment","fields":{"headline":"Tents, toilets, transport: eco-friendly festivals tackle the unholy trinity","bodyText":"When Chris Johnson first started putting on outdoor parties with his mates, they were small, impromptu and shambolic – or “really good fun”, as he puts it. Seventeen years later and he and the same four university friends are still pioneering in their field of partying, albeit Shambala is now a four-day festival in rural Northamptonshire with 15,000 people that has set an industry standard for its eco-credentials. “We’re a purpose-led organisation, the point of it existing is to contribute something to the world,” says Johnson, “and the environment is an important part of our outlook; we have a responsibility – but also an opportunity to experiment.” The festival now uses 100% renewable power from a mix of vegetable oil and solar power units, has eradicated disposable plastics, and became fully meat and fish free in 2015. “It caused a storm initially,” says Johnson, “but the appetite is there. This year we’ve got 1% of our audience coming by bike and 25% by coach. It might not seem much, but 80% of the carbon footprint of a camping festival is made by travel down to the site.” If the cultural conversation around festivals in recent years has focused on shaming organisers into booking more female musicians for their lineups or making them less white, the buzz this summer is on sustainability: how can festivals go green? For one, the war on plastic seems to have proliferated: this year, Glastonbury has banned the sale of single-use plastic drink bottles across the site. Co-organiser Emily Eavis estimates “the ban will save the million bottles that we would have otherwise sold” and is in line with the festival’s ethos to tread lightly on the land. Instead, the 200,000-strong audience will be served by 850 water taps and dozens of water kiosks, using Worthy Farm’s purpose-built water reservoirs. Earlier this year more than 60 major festivals, including Reading, Leeds and Download, pledged to go plastic-free by 2021. Straws, cutlery and bottles remain major offenders and bans have been met with enthusiasm by audiences. But according to Claire O’Neill, co-founder of the not-for-profit organisation A Greener Festival, which audits and advises the industry on how to reduce its environmental impact, the key challenges remain “transport, tents and toilets”. Getting festival-goers to the site using public transport or signing up to car-share schemes makes the biggest difference to the carbon footprint. Trying to make sure they pack up and take their tents is also a major environmental headache. “We actively ask people to consider what they bring to the festival and urge them not to bring disposable tents,” says Ian Fielder, operations director at Green Man festival. “We don’t ban it because we don’t want to become financially prohibitive, but they are a bane for most festivals. The waste is extraordinary.” Green Man works with refugee charities to repurpose left-behind tents, but emphasises that many of them are impossible to recycle and get sent to incinerators. At Houghton, an electronic music festival set in a Norfolk estate, sewage is treated equally seriously. “We’re using compostable toilets across the site this year,” says co-founder Tom Elkington, who explains at length the environmental benefits over chemical portable toilets. “Being sustainable and ethical is a core social responsibility for us – a lot of what we do isn’t legislation, but it probably should be.” For Festival Republic boss Melvin Benn, who runs major events including Latitude and Wireless, efficient use of the diesel-powered generators used on sites remains a key focal point. For Benn, converting to vegetable waste oil, biofuel and hybrid units makes environmental and economic sense. “I’ve worked with De Montfort University and a group called Powerful Thinking to seriously look at and measure the power drain from each generator,” he says. Monitoring from A Greener Festival shows that average generator efficiency is between 10% and 20% at the 7,000 outdoor events hosted in the UK every year; the ideal range is between 50% and 70%. Benn has hopes his festivals will be the first to hit that range. At BlueDot, a science and music festival held at Jodrell Bank observatory in Manchester, the line-up is heavy with climate crisis panels and talks from experts and activists. According to the festival director, Ben Robinson, the emphasis isn’t just on what happens at the festival but what the audience takes from it afterwards. “Of course, building mini-cities in fields every summer has an environmental impact,” he says. “But festivals can prompt long-term behavioural change. It’s not just about hedonism. People are open to new ideas and it invites them into a different conversation. We cause a conscious cultural shift – using less plastic, reducing waste, living sustainably. If these can be achieved on site, they can make a difference long after people have gone home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/jun/04/nuclear-power-doesnt-stack-up-without-a-carbon-price-industry-group-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-03T18:00:10Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power doesn't stack up without a carbon price, industry group says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/04/nuclear-power-doesnt-stack-up-without-a-carbon-price-industry-group-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/jun/04/nuclear-power-doesnt-stack-up-without-a-carbon-price-industry-group-says","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power doesn't stack up without a carbon price, industry group says","bodyText":"Australia would need to adopt a carbon price for nuclear power to be economically viable, a peak lobby group for the sector says, as it welcomes a push by the Nationals for a fresh Senate inquiry into the idea. The Australian Nuclear Association, which advocates for nuclear science and technology, said nuclear power could provide cheap, reliable, carbon-free energy in Australia, but it would only be cost competitive with gas and coal generation if pollution was priced. “They [reactors] don’t stack up in the current environment unless you have got some direct government intervention or a carbon price,” the ANA’s vice president, Robert Parker, said, suggesting a carbon price of about $20 a tonne would be sufficient for the sector to be competitive. He said “if people want to take climate change seriously”, then nuclear would enable the country to reduce CO2 emissions in line with the recommendations of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which requires human-caused emissions to reach ‘net zero’ by 2050. “If we are going to go down that road of trying to decarbonise as much as practically possible, then our analysis shows nuclear is the way to go,” he said. Nuclear power becomes cheaper than wind or solar power generation the more the electricity sector switches to carbon-free generation, according to the ANA’s analysis, with the cost of reactors about half what they were a decade ago. “The more you try to reduce your emissions across the electricity sector, the cheaper nuclear will be.” The ANA’s comments come as Nationals MPs push for a new Senate inquiry into the potential of nuclear power in Australia, ahead of a statutory review of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act due this year. The Minerals Council of Australia has flagged it will use the EPBC Act review to push for a removal of the country’s nuclear ban, saying Australia is the only high electricity consuming country without nuclear power in its energy mix. But as the sector suggests pricing pollution could help incentivise nuclear power generation and encourage Australia to cut its emissions, the resources minister, Matthew Canavan, is arguing against a carbon price, criticising business for its support of a market mechanism. The Nationals MP Keith Pitt, who is leading the charge for the new Senate probe, said he was open to the idea that a carbon price may be necessary for nuclear power to stack up. “This is the purpose of having the select committee, I think it is past time we had the conversation with the Australian people about nuclear energy,” Pitt said. He said he wanted the select committee to also look at the lifetime costs of renewable technologies in comparison to nuclear, saying solar panels only had a life expectancy of up to 20 years and there were “tens of millions” of them already in the system. “We have got a real risk particularly with solar panels and lithium batteries that they could turn out to be this generation’s asbestos,” he said. “We need to look at the life cycle in its entirety and we need to have a balanced approach moving forward with energy in this country.” On Monday, the former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce said he agreed with Pitt’s push for Australia to use nuclear power. “We dig it up, semi process it, send it to others to use and SA Labor believes we can take the scraps back and bury them. We believe in a reactor for medical purposes smack in the middle of Sydney BUT we must not use it for our power,” he said on Twitter. During the election campaign, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, appeared to open the door to Australia having a nuclear industry, saying “if it can pay its way”, the industry should be allowed to operate. But after facing a backlash from Labor, Morrison said the government had “no plans” to change the law to allow nuclear power in Australia. Morrison referred to the federal review of nuclear power undertaken by Ziggy Switkowski in 2006, saying the taskforce found it could not “support itself”. The report concluded that nuclear could help with emissions reduction, but the power would be on average 20–50% more expensive to produce than coal-fired power “if pollution, including carbon dioxide emissions, is not priced”. However, the total cost of building a nuclear power station could still be prohibitive. In the UK, the estimated bill for the nation’s first new nuclear power station in more than 20 years, Hinkley Point C, has blown out to £20.3bn (A$40bn)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/feb/28/chinese-dam-project-in-guinea-could-kill-up-to-1500-chimpanzees","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-28T06:00:50Z","webTitle":"Chinese dam project in Guinea could kill up to 1,500 chimpanzees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/28/chinese-dam-project-in-guinea-could-kill-up-to-1500-chimpanzees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/feb/28/chinese-dam-project-in-guinea-could-kill-up-to-1500-chimpanzees","fields":{"headline":"Chinese dam project in Guinea could kill up to 1,500 chimpanzees","bodyText":"Up to 1,500 chimpanzees could be killed by a new Chinese dam that will swamp a crucial sanctuary for the endangered primate in Guinea, experts have warned. The 294MW Koukoutamba dam will be built by Sinohydro, the world’s biggest hydroelectric power plant construction company, in the middle of a newly declared protected area called the Moyen-Bafing National park. The Chinese company is already facing similar criticism for building a dam in Indonesia that threatens the only known habitat of a newly discovered species of orangutan. Its executives signed a contract this week with local representatives eager to secure a power project that will bring energy and funds to one of Africa’s poorest countries. The flooding of swathes of the park is expected to force the displacement of 8,700 people. It will also increase the pressure on western chimpanzees, which have declined by 80% in the past 20 years, and are now considered critically endangered – the highest level of risk – by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The highlands of Guinea are home to Africa’s healthiest remaining population of about 16,500 western chimpanzees. In most other countries, this subspecies is either extinct or perilously threatened in populations of less than 100 individuals. The Moyen-Bafing reserve was established in 2016 as a “chimpanzee offset” and funded by two mining companies – Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée and Guinea Alumina Corporation – in return for permission to open mineral excavation sites inside other territories of the primate. Rebecca Kormos, a primatologist who has been researching the animal for decades, has warned that a dam inside the park would have the biggest impact a development project has ever had on chimpanzees. “I hope Sinohydro will reconsider engaging in a project that could drive the western chimpanzee into extinction. Once a species goes, it’s gone forever,” she said. She estimates 800 to 1,500 chimpanzees will die as a result of the project, either by having their habitats flooded or as a result of territorial conflicts if they try to move. The ape is not the only species at risk. Scientists have recently discovered a critically endangered aquatic herb near the Koukoutamba falls. The plan for the dam is popular in Guinea. But conservationists say the local population is unaware that the electricity will not be generated for them. “This is not a case of the international community putting chimpanzees before people. Three-quarters of the energy will be sold to neighbouring countries and the remaining quarter is for the mining industry,” Kormos said. Almost 150,000 people have signed petitions urging Guinea to halt the construction of the dam and adopt solar power, which the World Bank has offered to facilitate. If the dam goes ahead, conservationists say Sinohydro should engage with biologists to mitigate the impact. Sinohydro did not respond to requests for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2021/dec/13/australia-covid-news-corona-queensland-nsw-wa-victoria-borders-palaszczuk-mcgowan-morrison-frydenberg","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-13T08:04:33Z","webTitle":"WA to ease hard border from 5 February – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/dec/13/australia-covid-news-corona-queensland-nsw-wa-victoria-borders-palaszczuk-mcgowan-morrison-frydenberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2021/dec/13/australia-covid-news-corona-queensland-nsw-wa-victoria-borders-palaszczuk-mcgowan-morrison-frydenberg","fields":{"headline":"WA to ease hard border from 5 February – as it happened","bodyText":"With that, we’ll end our live coverage for today. Here’s a recap of today’s major news developments: Western Australia will ease its border rules from 5 February. Both international and domestic travellers will be able to enter the state without quarantining from that date, by which point it is expected to have vaccinated 90% of its population over 12 with two doses. All travellers will need to be vaccinated, with a very small weekly cap of hotel quarantine spots for unvaccinated international arrivals. Thousands of Queenslanders will be finally enjoying dinner in their own homes on Monday after spending months trapped across the border in New South Wales. The border between the two states reopened just after midnight Queensland time. Scott Morrison welcomed the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, to Canberra on Monday, with the leaders heralding closer defence ties as they witnessed the signing of a previously announced $1bn military equipment contract with a South Korean firm. Australia’s international border will open to more travellers on Wednesday, as the prime minister confirmed that his government would end the “pause” triggered by the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant. Covid-19 infections are continuing to grow, with Victoria reporting 1,290 new cases and two deaths, while NSW recorded 536 new cases, amid increasing numbers of the Omicron variant. Have a great evening. We’ll be back tomorrow to do it all over again. The auditor general has just published the annual report on major defence acquisitions. It’s basically a yearly stocktake on where major projects are tracking, based on information supplied by the Department of Defence. This is the report for the 2020-21 financial year, so it is looking backwards. Grant Hehir, the auditor general, found nothing that caused him to believe any problems with the accuracy of the information supplied by Defence as part of the process. But the voluminous report notes: “Defence’s assessment indicates that some elements of capability to be delivered by projects may be ‘under threat’, but the risk is assessed as ‘manageable’.” The report said the four project offices “experiencing challenges with expected capability delivery” are the Joint Strike Fighter, MRH90 helicopters, Overlander medium/heavy vehicles, and Battlespace communications systems (land) 2B. The second project listed there – MRH90 helicopters – is also known as the Taipan. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, announced last Friday a plan to acquire up to 40 Black Hawk helicopters in order to retire the MRH90 early. Rest assured, readers, we will be going through this report in greater detail in the coming days. Paul Mercurio, the actor and dancer known for his role in Strictly Ballroom, has been preselected as the Labor candidate for the Victorian state seat of Hastings. Premier Mark McGowan has said Western Australia will not reopen its borders earlier than 5 February even if it achieves 90% double-dose vaccination coverage before that date. He said this is because businesses need to prepare for a specific date and have certainty things won’t change. Western Australia’s quarantine cap for unvaccinated international arrivals could be limited to fewer than 100 people per week. Mark McGowan said an exact number had not yet been determined, but that “it may be down at 100 or perhaps less per week”. By contrast, New South Wales’ unvaccinated arrival cap is 210 per week, while Victoria’s is 250. As McGowan explained earlier, WA will only be allowing a small number of unvaccinated travellers arriving from overseas, and they will have to go through 14 days of hotel quarantine. Domestic arrivals will need to be double-dose vaccinated. Asked if he was considering extending the option of hotel quarantine for unvaccinated domestic travellers, McGowan said: “Not at this point in time, no.” McGowan explains that his strict stance on maintaining rules for unvaccinated people and poorly vaccinated regions after 5 February is because of vulnerable people in the state. Specifically, he mentions older and Indigenous residents. “We’re just trying to save their lives. It will find the unvaccinated. You might live in the desert but it can still find you.” Premier Mark McGowan was asked if further spread of the Omicron variant in other states could delay Western Australia’s border reopening date of 5 February. McGowan didn’t go as far as ruling it out, but said it was very unlikely. “Barring some unforeseen emergency or catastrophe which we can’t predict. But that’s the nature of Covid.” He said “it’s a very safe bet” that the border will reopen on 5 February. Western Australia’s health minister Roger Cook has urged residents in his state to use the time between now and 5 February – when the state will reopen its borders – to get vaccinated. Cook addressed the fact that an already stretched health system in the state was predicted to buckle if Covid spread when its vaccination rate was low. He said nearly 500 doctors and 350 graduate doctors have joined the system this year. Cook said: Make every day count, every day must be counted between now and 5 February. We have the precious gift of time to continue to get as many people vaccinated as possible. We need to make the most of this opportunity, Make no mistake about it, Covid is coming into our state. Western Australians are going to be in for a real shock from 5 February. We are going to be living with Covid-19. But there is no easy way of living with the worst virus in 100 years. McGowan is warning that there could still be travel restrictions for certain remote communities because of lower vaccination rates. McGowan said “some regions have dramatically lower vaccination rates”, flagging the Pilbara, Goldfields and the Kimberley specifically. “These are the only regions that currently have a first dose rate below 80%,” McGowan said. He said the Pilbara is of most concern, with a double -dose vaccination rate of just 46.1%. “If individual regions do not get their vaccination rates up, then further measures will be needed to protect the community.” Mark McGowan is now explaining how Western Australia’s new border rules will work when they come into effect from 5 February. International arrivals will still be required to return a negative PCR test result within 72 hours of departure and undertake a PCR test within 48 hours of arrival in Perth, as well as six days after arriving. If the traveller is double vaccinated, there will be no quarantine requirement. For those who are not double vaccinated or have received a vaccine that is not recognised in Australia, they will have to go into a hotel or dedicated quarantine facility when it opens. McGowan said the cap of quarantine places for unvaccinated travellers will be smaller than WA’s current cap for all arrivals. Domestic arrivals must be double vaccinated unless they have a valid exemption. Domestic travellers will still be required to return a negative PCR test result within 72 hours of departure and undertake a PCR test within 48 hours of arrival in Perth If a traveller’s stay in WA is for five days or less, they will only be required to return a negative PCR test result within 72 hours of departure, and won’t need to get another test within 48 hours of landing. Premier Mark McGowan has announced that Western Australia’s hard border will ease on 5 February. It will take effect from 12:01am on that day, a Saturday. McGowan explained that he was making the announcement because WA had on Monday just reached 80% double dose vaccination coverage of residents 12 and over. By 5 February, McGowan said he expects the state to have reached 90% coverage. McGowan said: Even though Western Australians have lived a normal life inside our Covid free bubble, nearly 2 million people have done the right thing and gotten vaccinated. We followed a different model to the others. And it’s worked. I want to acknowledge each and every Western Australian for everything they’ve done over the past two years. Western Australia’s current zero Covid environment and high vaccination rate will help deliver the softest landing to minimise the impact of the virus. When it enters our state, McGowan’s announcement has defied earlier speculation on Monday that the state would ease its border rules from late January. Australia’s international border will open to more travellers on Wednesday, as the prime minister confirmed that his government would end the “pause” triggered by the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant. Scott Morrison, welcoming the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, to Canberra on Monday, said Australia would open to travellers from South Korea and Japan and also international students and skilled workers more broadly. While pandemic recovery was on the agenda for the talks at Parliament House, the leaders also heralded closer defence ties as they witnessed the signing of a previously announced $1bn military equipment contract with a South Korean firm. Moon said he respected the Australian government’s “sovereign” decision to strike the Aukus deal with the US and the UK – an arrangement that China has claimed poses a threat to regional stability, amid worsening tensions between Beijing and Canberra. But the South Korean leader also voiced a desire to maintain a harmonious relationship with China, which he said was important to securing North Korea’s denuclearisation. He ruled out joining Australia, the US and other countries in a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics.

Here is the run down for every capital city: We’re expecting Mark McGowan to outline Western Australia’s border reopening date at 2pm WA time/5pm eastern daylight time. We’ll bring you that update here as it happens. Meanwhile in Victoria, the Australian Workers Union has raised concerns about the preselection process for the 2022 election amid ongoing factional turmoil in the state arising from the exit of party powerbroker Adem Somyurek. AWU branch secretary Ben Davis has written to state secretary Chris Ford calling for a halt to the preselection process that is being run by the national executive, alleging irregularities that are “potentially fraudulent”. Davis says that a number of party members have alleged that nomination forms have been filled out before a candidate has been selected, which he says is “potentially creating a false document pursuant to the Crimes Act. “As a member of the Interim Governance Committee (IGC) I hereby request that nomination forms for all contested ballots be provided to me, and if you see fit to the other members of the IGC also, before any ballots of national Executive are held,” the letter says. “Delaying the ballots in the contested seats should also occur until the party can conduct an appropriate investigation.” So far, seven sitting Labor MPs have been targeted as a result of the factional in-fighting, with one of these, upper house MP Cesar Melhem, describing the situation as “total bloodletting”. Millions of tourism dollars are expected to be injected into the Queensland economy after the state reopened its borders to fully vaccinated visitors, reports AAP. Tens of thousands of people began flooding into Queensland on Monday following the decision to drop entry and quarantine restrictions at 1am for fully jabbed travellers after hitting the 80% double vaccination target. The arrival of interstate travellers in time for the festive season is a much-needed boost for tourism, particularly in the state’s far north. Tourism Tropical North Queensland chief executive Mark Olsen said the region had been losing millions of dollars a day since early 2020. He told Nine: It’s been a really tough 21 months for the (far north) tourism industry. One third of our visitors are normally international ... and we haven’t seen them since February 2020 ... Both NSW and Victorian visitors put a million a day each into this economy so we have really been looking forward to having them back. Olsen said more than 9,000 tourism jobs in the far north had been lost since early 2020 but was confident it could bounce back after Monday’s reopening. You can read more about Queensland’s border rules easing from today in this article, filed by Jennifer King in Tweed Heads. There are 16 new cases of Covid-19 in the Northern Territory, with the government considering ramping up Covid rules for some communities. Of the new cases announced on Monday, 14 are from East Katherine, where authorities had been doing a testing “blitz”. A chief health officer directive will be issued from today requiring anyone in the NT who has been in Katherine recently to get tested. Nicole Manison, deputy chief minister of the NT, has also revealed there were only five Covid tests conducted in Tennant Creek – a town of about 5,000 – on Sunday despite positive wastewater detections of Covid. She said “frankly, that is not good enough”. Manison said it was “likely” the government would escalate Covid rules and introduce “lockouts” – where unvaccinated people are placed in lockdown – in some regional communities in the territory in coming days. South Australian premier Steven Marshall has said there are 13 new Covid-19 cases in his state for the reporting period announced on Monday. He said the majority of the cases are believed to be the Delta variant. There have so far been two confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in SA. There has been a bit more sun across New South Wales in recent days, prompting concern for people swimming in hazardous conditions at beaches in the state. Over the weekend, Surf Life Saving NSW volunteers performed more than 60 rescues, with two people requiring resuscitation. Sadly, a middle-aged man was unable to be revived at Coffs Harbour on Saturday. He was pulled from the water about 300m north of the patrol flags, semi-conscious and still breathing. NSW Ambulance inspector Charnan Kurth said “drownings can occur in seconds – we have to be constantly looking out for each other”. In the UK, Boris Johnson is gambling on an unprecedented ramping up of vaccinations, rolling out 1m booster jabs a day to stem an incoming “tidal wave of Omicron” and avoid imposing further restrictions. The army will be deployed across the country to help rapidly accelerate the vaccine program and GPs will be told to cancel appointments to dedicate resources to offering vaccines to every UK adult by the end of December. In a televised address to the nation on Sunday night, the prime minister said he was “afraid we are now facing an emergency in our battle with the new variant, Omicron, and we must urgently reinforce our wall of vaccine protection to keep our friends and loved ones safe”. Read more: The RSPCA has teamed up with two other leading animal welfare organisations to lobby both clothing brands and sheep farmers to move away from mulesing sheep. RSPCA Australia, Four Paws and Humane Society International say they will work with the wool industry to encourage the breeding of sheep that do not require mulesing. Mulesing is the process of removing folds of skin from the tail area of a sheep. It’s done to reduce flystrike and is mainly practised on sheep that have folds of skin, like merinos. It used to be the industry standard in Australia, where flystrike can be a deadly problem, but over the past two decades many wool producers have focused on breeding sheep that do not require mulesing. Some farming organisations are also changing their standards to discourage mulesing. The Victorian Farmers Federation lobbied for regulations requiring the mandatory use of pain relief when mulesing sheep, which came into effect last year. But the Australian Superfine Wool Growers Association remains in support of the practice. Four Paws’s wool expert, Rebecca Picallo Gil, said more than 3,000 Australian woolgrowers had already switched to no-mules flocks. Humane Society international’s Georgie Dolphin said: With the advanced genetics available today, it is unacceptable to continue to breed wrinkly sheep that are prone to flystrike. Our organisations want to see an end to mulesing within the next decade, a target that is easily achievable. One of the most tangible announcements from the joint presser was Scott Morrison confirming the international borders would reopen as planned this Wednesday. We reported last week this was likely, but a bunch of international students and other travellers have been anxiously messaging Guardian Australia over the weekend hoping for some certainty. This should come as a relief to them. First, a quick recap: the government announced in late November it was delaying the plan to reopen Australia to international skilled and student cohorts, as well as humanitarian, working, holidaymaker and provisional family visa holders, from 1 December until 15 December. That “pause” also included reopening to travellers from Japan and South Korea. It was to gather more information about the Omicron variant. As it stood, the Australian border was “already closed to travellers except fully vaccinated Australian citizens, permanent residents and immediate family, as well as fully vaccinated green lane travellers from New Zealand and Singapore and limited exemptions”, per the government release at the time. All arrivals to Australia also require a negative PCR test and to complete Australian traveller declaration forms detailing their vaccination status and confirming requirements to comply with state and territory public health requirements. While the government has been signalling it wanted to get on with reopening, these things are always subject to change, based on latest advice about Omicron – so many travellers were worried about whether their plans would be disrupted once again. But Morrison, standing next to South Korean president Moon Jae-in, told reporters: We also have tourism and education links that run deep – some 20,000 Korean students come and study in Australia – and we are looking forward to welcoming them back as we are the many tourists and business travellers and skilled migrants. And on Wednesday of this week, we will move again forward. The borders will be reopened both to Korea and to Japan and for skilled migration and for students as we conclude the pause that we announced several weeks ago. Morrison praised the high level of vaccination in both countries, adding: I know the more than 123,000 Australians of Korean ancestry will be looking forward to seeing their friends, their family and them being able to join together and that has been made possible because of the outstanding achievements in Korea in managing Covid and I congratulate the president on their achievements.

With that, I shall hand you over to the amazing Elias Visontay, who will bring all the news for the rest of the afternoon. In other news, John Gerrard has now officially taken up his position as the new Queensland chief health officer after Jennette Young moves on and up to the governor role. A small word of caution on the defence announcement out of the Scott Morrison/Moon Jae-in joint presser. The Morrison government has confirmed that a $1bn defence contract for new Self-Propelled Howitzers for the Australian Army has been awarded to Hanwha Defense Australia. From Morrison’s release: “Based in Greater Geelong, the contract will procure Self-Propelled Howitzers and Armoured Ammunition Resupply Vehicles, under the LAND 8116 Phase 1 project. The government committed to this project in May 2019.” The then defence minister, Linda Reynolds, announced in September last year that Hanwha Defence Australia had been chosen to build 30 self-propelled howitzers for the ADF, to be built in the Geelong region, as you can see from this story at the time. The contract signing was witnessed by Morrison and Moon before their joint press conference in parliament house in Canberra this morning. In today’s release, the government says the initial contract “covers 30 Self-Propelled Howitzers, 15 Armoured Ammunition Resupply Vehicles, and weapon locating radars that help find enemy artillery, collectively referred to as the Huntsman family of vehicles”. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, said: “The prime ability of the new vehicles is to fire and move quickly, avoiding enemy counter-attack. This project will mean a significant increase in the level of firepower and security for Australian artillery capability.” A group of male koalas from Victoria’s Strzelecki Ranges will be brought to Adelaide as part of a new breeding program aimed at securing the survival of the species. The koalas are expected to arrive in coming weeks to join a group of disease-free male and female koalas at the Cleland Wildlife Park in the Adelaide Hills. The Cleland population, including some koalas rescued from the 2020 Kangaroo Island bushfires, is considered to be the only sanctuary-managed colony free from both chlamydia and koala retrovirus in Australia. Environment minister David Speirs says the transfer of the koalas is part of a bold conservation initiative that will help secure the survival of the species. Catastrophic events like last year’s bushfires across Australia significantly reduced koala numbers... That’s why this unique breeding program, which will include the addition of the Strzelecki koalas, will help to safeguard populations and provide opportunities for research as a priority for the species’ long-term survival. The Victorian koalas are being taken from a private forest plantation after assurances from wildlife authorities their removal was in the interests of conservation. Koala Life, an independent not-for-profit organisation set up for the conservation and research of koala diseases, said the relocation would increase the number of disease-free genetically diverse animals, which would ultimately help to protect the species from future challenges. Chief executive Chris Daniels: It’s also an important step in our scientific breeding program and significantly assists our research into the species... These koalas will form part of a breeding program that can support the long-term conservation of the species, particularly in response to natural disasters. Thousands of Queenslanders will be enjoying dinner in their own homes on Monday at last after spending months trapped across the border in New South Wales. The border between the two states reopened at 1am Queensland time. Queensland’s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, estimated that 50,000 vehicles would be crossing in the early hours of Monday morning, with long delays expected. All vehicles were required to present a border pass that was only made available to those travelling from hotspots one hour before the border opened, leaving many already anxious travellers more worried about getting home. You can read the full report below: On the day borders reopen, Queensland has recorded one new locally acquired case, as well as two overseas-acquired cases and seven interstate-acquired cases, detected in hotel quarantine. Moon’s response, to paraphrase, was basically: “Dude, we have a rogue nation with a bunch of nukes right above us that we are technically still at war with - yeah we are going to try and be friends with as many people as possible, mate.” Moon: With regard to the question on the relationship with China, that was your question: Korea and Australia uphold the same values and our position in terms of the geopolitical situation, we are like-minded. First of all, in terms of our alliance with the US, it’s the basis of our diplomacy as well as security affairs and in terms of the economic relationship, of course, the relationship with China is important. However, Korea has another factor to take into account and that has to do with the peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and also denuclearisation of DPRK. We need the constructive efforts of China to enable the denuclearisation of [the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea]. Therefore, Korea is focused on the steadfast alliance with the US and also with China; we want a harmonised relationship. And we want to maintain such a relationship and we will be putting in the efforts to make this happen. And, of course, with regard to the relationship with China, there may be certain conflicts and there may be some issues of competition. However, if you look at climate change and the supply chain issue, and also in terms of pandemic and infectious diseases, there are global challenges and these are domains where we do need cooperation and collaboration. Morrison: I have absolutely no doubt that our only ambition between Australia and Korea is to ensure a peaceful and safe and free and open Indo-Pacific. Where all nations in the region can trade openly and well and positively, free from any coercion and have their own choices about how they move forward. Reporter: President Moon, Australia, like South Korea, has faced billions of dollars in Chinese trade sanctions as punishment for domestic policy decisions. How should countries respond to Chinese economic coercion? And to Scott Morrison: how can Australia and Korea work together to counter Chinese economic coercion? Morrison jumped in to answer first (perhaps as the question was being translated?). I might start - the question has come from the Australian side. I would say this. Australia and Korea are like-minded liberal democracies and we work together to ensure there are economic choices in the region. There is a strengthening of our capabilities both from defence security point of view and not just in the traditional, but also in the new areas of cyber and new technologies that occurs in a security space, but also occurs in an economic space. The fact that we’re working together on critical minerals supply chains and rare earths, these are the critical minerals and rare earths that power and support a new energy economy. And so ensuring that there are trusted supply chains between like-minded countries is incredibly important for our region. It brings stability, it brings balance. Moon says that this trip has nothing to do with China and Morrison immediately added: When you are engaging with other countries in these types of contracts, it is an objective to be doing so with those countries who are like-minded in their outlook, and I think between Korea and Australia we share a very similar view and a similar aspiration for the Indo-Pacific. Moon Jae-in has been asked by reporters if visiting Australia just days after the government decided on a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics was likely to upset South Korea’s relationship with China (which is always fairly strained anyway, given the issue of North Korea). He was also asked if South Korea intend to issue a similar boycott. Moon: With regards to the Beijing Olympics on the diplomatic boycott, we have not received a request from any other country, including the United States, to participate in the diplomatic boycott. We are not considering a boycott measure. With regards to AUKUS, we respect the decision made by the sovereign state, Australia, and this is the decision made by Australia as a sovereign nation and we respect that. And Australia is making efforts for peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region and within the region. Australia does not desire dispute arising in the region and, for peace, we will continue to cooperate with Australia. And the state visit I make at this time has nothing to do with our position over China and we believe that between Korea and Australia it is very important that we cooperate over the core minerals and for the hydrogen economy and for the low-carbon emissions technology. Moon: Third, we agree to strengthen supply chain cooperation. Australia, the world’s richest country in mineral resources, and Korea, a major producer of batteries and electric vehicles, play an important role in the global supply chain. Our two countries share the view that establishing a stable mineral supply chain is important not only for the two countries but also for the global economy, and we have signed the MoU on cooperation in the critical mineral supply chain. We will systematically cooperate throughout the entire resource development cycle including mineral exploration, development, production and mining disaster management, further strengthening human exchange and technical cooperation. Today, the two countries have set a new milestone in cooperation based on the solid friendship and trust we have built over the past 60 years. We will, together, prepare for a new era. South Korea and Australia are also apparently great space buddies now! Moon: Second, we have agreed to nurture our key future industries together. The two countries declared to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and are focusing on a transition to a low-carbon economy. Today, the prime minister and I signed the plan for low- and zero-emissions technology partnership by broadening the ecofriendly technologies such as hydrogen economy, solar power and carbon capture mechanisms. We will turn it into an opportunity to create new jobs and industries. We have also decided to strengthen space cooperation. Australia established a space agency in 2018 and is spurring efforts to foster its space industry. Korea has also set a new turning point for space development, with the launch of the new rocket this year. I hope that the MoU regarding space cooperation will enhance exchange and foster cooperation in fields from space exploration in the launch vehicle industry to satellite navigation, and I hope the agreement becomes a stepping stone for the two countries. If you were wondering whether this is all a thinly veiled front to send a message to China about who really has power in the Indo-Pacific, here is Moon: The prime minister actively supported the Korean people and the peace process and two countries continue working to the towards the lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, and also peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. Moon is now delivering his speech in Korean. Luckily I’m fluent! (I’m not, I shall be using the ABC translation.) Your excellency, prime minister Morrison, thank you very much for the warm hospitality. You have invited me as Australia’s first [leader] since the Covid-19 outbreak and today our two countries have formed a close cooperative relationship. I think this will be a great gift for the people of two countries to celebrate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties ... Today the prime minister and I advanced our bilateral relations and elevated to a comprehensive Australian partnership. Together our two countries will leap forward as global leaders and look forward to moving towards a future of shared prosperity. First, we agree to strengthen ... strategic cooperation for fostering regional prosperity. Morrison: Australia and Korea have some of the highest vaccination rates double-dose of anywhere in the world, and so that is enabling our economies to open up and we see that today here in Australia as the borders come tumbling down there in - between Queensland and the rest of the country - and Australians are being reunited because of their effort to get vaccinated and to see families reunited, to see Australians coming together as we get to the end of this year. This is encouraging, but I know the more than 123,000 Australians of Korean ancestry will be looking forward to seeing their friends, their family and them being able to join together. This has been made possible because of the outstanding achievements in Korea in managing Covid and I congratulate the president on their achievements. We look to proceeding with the many agreements that we have announced today, whether in defence, defence materiel, the memorandum of understanding to establish an implementation plan for Australia and Korea’s low zero-emissions technology partnership that the president and I agreed we would proceed with when we met together in the UK at Carbis Bay at the G7. Here is Daniel Hurst with a bit more information on those deals that were signed by Morrison and Moon this morning. Morrison: Today, as always, our economies complement each other. We are important trading partners and we welcome the prospect of Korea joining the CPTPP [comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership] and we look forward - should they wish to take that decision and step - we look forward to being an encouraging partner. The CTPPP sets a high bar for countries that understand the importance of the rule of law in trade that deals with its partners fairly and consistently in a way that promotes free trade and Korea has already achieved those marks, not only in their relationship with Australia, but with the many trading partners with whom they have trusted relationships. This investment goes in both directions and we look forward to that continuing. We’re also important security partners as we have just witnessed with the howitzer contract, a billion-dollar armoured vehicle centre for excellence to be located in the Geelong region. Here is Morrison speaking, and yes, he did get the name of the Korean War wrong ... while speaking to the president of Korea. It’s a great honour to have you here in Australia in what is your first ever trip to Australia along with first lady Kim. As guest of our government on this important state visit, the first of these we have had since the outbreak of Covid ... As you know, the friendship between your nations is deep and historic. From Kapyong to here we are now in Canberra. Our ties were forged during the Vietnam - during the Korean - War. Australia was the second nation after the United States to come to Korea’s aid in those very dark days. More than 17,000 Australians fought to defend your freedom and, indeed, the freedom of all liberal democracy peace-loving countries in these conflicts. Australia and South Korea have struck a $1bn defence deal as leaders Scott Morrison and Moon Jae-in hold formal talks in Canberra, reports Paul Osborne from AAP. The South Korean president and first lady Kim Jung-sook were welcomed to Parliament House, where they signed the official visitors book, by the prime minister on Monday. Australia and South Korea will upgrade their ties to “comprehensive strategic partnership” status during the visit. The $1bn deal - under which Korean defence company Hanwha will provide 30 self-propelled howitzer artillery weapons, 15 ammunition supply vehicles and radars to detect enemy artillery - is the largest defence contract struck between Australia and an Asian nation. The new vehicles will be able to quickly fire and move to avoid enemy counterattacks. Defence minister Peter Dutton touted the deal as a boost for Australian firepower and security in the Indo-Pacific. [It] is one of several projects that will modernise the Australian Army, ensuring it continues to maintain a capability advantage now, and into the future... We are committed to keeping our region safe while protecting our interests in a rapidly changing global environment. The deal is expected to create at least 300 jobs in the Greater Geelong region, where the manufacturing facility will be based. Construction is due to start in 2022. Morrison said the relationship continued to grow, underpinned by trade, shared values, common regional strategic interests and a commitment to an open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. Our comprehensive strategic partnership with the Republic of Korea is underpinned by our joint commitment to defence and security cooperation. This year mark 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations. Moon is the first international leader to visit Australia since borders reopened. So Moon and Morrison are signing some partnerships and deal first, and I assume will speak after that. We are standing by for Scott Morrison and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, to give a joint address from Parliament House in Canberra. A flood warning and total fire ban in the same state on the same day has pretty big “post-apocalyptic” energy, doesn’t it? It’s time to have a chat about what’s going on at The Sydney Morning Herald. Overnight, the newspaper posted an article confirming that newly appointed editor, Bevan Shields, had called longtime opinion columnist Elizabeth Farrelly and ended her arrangement with the paper after she “failed to disclose that she had registered as a candidate for the Labor party in the Strathfield local government elections when she wrote a piece criticising Liberal and independent councillors in the electorate”. The writer has now issued a statement on the situation via a Facebook post, stating that it was “an oversight on my part” not to disclose her registration, but says she never actually intended to run for local government. Simply to keep my options open, I registered my interest online. I was not preselected for the Labor federal candidate, nor for the Labor council ticket, so I did not run in the recent council election. I was involved with the Labor campaign only insofar as I agreed to have a placard on the front lawn for a couple of weeks and to hand out on polling day for 2 hours. This was done in thanks for the warm welcome I received to the neighbourhood. The ABC is reporting this morning that the Victorian Greens have referred the government-owned logging agency VicForests to the state’s anti-corruption watchdog and the ombudsman. It follows the ABC’s reporting of allegations that VicForests had logged sites illegally and spied on a conservationist. The logging agency has denied it logged illegally and said it always complied with the law. The Greens’ Ellen Sandell has written to the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC) and the ombudsman, asking them to launch investigations. I respectfully request that IBAC conduct an investigation into whether these actions by VicForests — especially the allegations of spying on a private citizen — constitute corrupt conduct and warrant further investigation... Using taxpayer money to hire a private investigator to spy on a private citizen I would consider a gross misuse of taxpayer funds. Serious allegations of widespread illegal activity by a Victorian public sector agency I would consider something also worthy of investigation by IBAC. Trade minister Dan Tehan has urged businesses not to hoard a chemical key to keeping Australia’s freight and logistics sectors on the road, reports AAP’s Georgie Moore. Australia has about seven weeks’ worth of urea – used in the diesel exhaust fluid AdBlue – left amid a global shortage as China restricts exports. The federal government is speaking to countries including Indonesia about shoring up Australia’s supply. It is also approaching Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Japan. Korea last month flew 27,000 litres of urea to Australia. Tehan told ABC radio this morning that the Covid-19 pandemic had highlighted the fragility of some supply chains: There will always be some stock which they [businesses] keep in warehouses ... But what we don’t want to see is the excessive warehousing of AdBlue at this stage. He is confident Australia will be able to secure the urea it needs: There is obviously issues around containers, shipping disruptions which we’re also working through ... But from everything that we’re seeing, there is clear supply which we can bring to Australia. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie has spoken to Radio National about the plight of Australian Julian Assange. Although attempts to extradite him from the UK to the US are ostensibly for their court system, Wilkie said “the reality is it’s always been intensely political” because he claims charges are politically motivated against Assange for “doing his job” as a journalist and reporting via WikiLeaks: This can be solved politically by Scott Morrison picking up the phone to Joe Biden and Boris Johnson and saying, ‘This has gone on long enough – it’s not acceptable that an Australian Walkley award-winning journalist is being kept in jail for really doing nothing more than publicising hard evidence of US war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, let’s release him and let him come back home.’ Wilkie also called on Labor leader Anthony Albanese to commit to the same, if he is elected. Wilkie said jail “is killing” Assange. On who he will help form government in a minority parliament, Wilkie said he had been burned by Julia Gillard reneging on his pokies reform, and in future he will treat “every vote on its merits including confidence and supply” – meaning no deal to support one side. Still, he said climate change will be important to him and Morrison has done “terribly” on the anti-corruption commission issue. Scott Morrison is currently welcoming the South Korean president, Moon Jae-In to Australia. Gosh, we are so far away from everyone, it’s always exciting when a political leader makes their way down here! Federal health minister Greg Hunt is speaking now from Melbourne where he has just announced that Medicare-funded telehealth options will become permanent. He also reiterated that Australia is on track to open the border for skilled labourers and international students: The first is about the reopening of the borders for students and for skilled labour on 15 December. Yes, we are on track for that. That has been reconfirmed over the weekend. We said on the 29th of November that we were intending to reopen on 15 December. That has been through the national cabinet process ... Then in terms of telehealth, it’s a continuation of the existing measures across the work of GPs, allied health and specialists and I want to thank everybody for their involvement in that. All of the different parts of the medical community have played their role but the RACGP has been our principal partner on that front and well supported by the AMA and ACRM. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie has implored Scott Morrison to pick up the phone to Joe Biden and Boris Johnson to end the prosecution of Julian Assange, AAP reports. The former intelligence analyst told the ABC: The reality is this has always been an intensively political matter and it can be solved politically by Scott Morrison picking up the phone to Joe Biden and Boris Johnson. It comes after reports the 50-year-old WikiLeaks founder suffered a stroke in prison in October. Wilkie said: Jail is killing Julian Assange. There is no way he will survive continued incarceration in the UK. Assange has just suffered a legal blow after the UK high court ruled he could be extradited to face charges in the US. His lawyers say they intend to appeal the decision in the UK’s highest court. He faces an 175-year prison sentence on espionage charges in the US over an alleged conspiracy to obtain and disclose classified information which revealed alleged war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. Just very normal things happening on the NSW/Queensland border. After a Gold Coast man who bludgeoned his teenage girlfriend to death escaped a murder charge by arguing that he had been provoked by her tales of infidelity, the Queensland government decided to step in. “Other than in exceptional or extreme cases you can’t rely on words, or conduct that consists substantially of words,” the state’s then attorney general, Cameron Dick, said in 2011. “We need a change to the law … just because you say something it doesn’t mean that you should be killed.” A decade later, another Queensland man, Arona Peniamina, also convinced a jury his spouse’s suspected infidelity had provoked him into ending her life in a jealous rage. The government’s reforms had not prevented him from successfully arguing he was guilty of manslaughter, rather than murder, because he had been provoked. You can read the full report below: Watch out, Queensland! Anthony Albanese is in your state now and is bringing the election campaign with him! Here’s what he had to say to the ABC before jumping on his flight to the sunshine state. We need to reconnect with Queenslanders, we didn’t do well enough in the last election. When I was locked out of Sydney because of restrictions, I spent a long time in Queensland, I did a couple of road trips up and down the coast. I visited every small place that there was in between Rockhampton and Brisbane down the coast, and I think that Queenslanders know that this is a tired government, the end of its third term, they don’t have an agenda for today, let alone a vision for tomorrow and I’ll be talking today about our plans including 465,000 free Tafe places, 20,000 additional university places, and how we build back stronger. We need to take of the sacrifice that Australians have made by actually trying to envisage how we become more resilient, how we make more things. On my trip to Queensland a few months ago, I went to Maryborough, they’re doing fantastic there. Making trains, building things, creating jobs in regional Queensland and that’s what I want to drive. A total fire ban has been declared for north-western Victoria, AAP reports. The Country Fire Authority says the Mallee and Wimmera regions will be subject to a total fire ban on Monday, It means no open-air fire can be lit or remain alight, and strict rules apply for the use of farm machinery, chainsaws and lawnmowers. “CFA advises people living in areas at risk of fire to activate their bushfire plan,” the authority said. Temperatures are expected to reach the mid to high 30s in the two regions, with strengthening north-westerly winds forecast early before a blustery southerly change crossing the state throughout the day. There is also a low risk of dry lightning in the area. A high fire danger rating applies for central, north-central, northern country and south-west regions, while the eastern parts of the state are of low to moderate risk. It is only the second total fire ban of the season, thanks in part to cooler and wetter-than-average weather in November. The outlook for this fire season indicates a lower threat of prolonged bushfires but grass and crop blazes remain a high risk across the state after average to above-average rainfall and strong fuel growth. CFA acting chief officer Garry Cook said: Overall, we’ve had milder conditions leading into this fire season, but we can’t afford to be complacent about these hot and windy days where the fire danger spikes. Grass and crop fires are prevalent this season and can move at speeds of up to 25km/h and jump highways. A person in New South Wales has been admitted to hospital infected with the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the first Omicron patient to be hospitalised since it arrived in Australia last month. It comes as thousands of protesters marched through capital cities yesterday to oppose vaccine mandates, and Western Australia and Queensland prepared to reopen their borders. After two years of border closures, the WA premier, Mark McGowan, is today due to announce when the state’s borders will reopen to domestic and international travellers, after reaching the 80% vaccination milestone at the weekend. And “tens of thousands” of people are expected to cross into Queensland after its borders reopen at 1am on Monday. It will be the first time in 229 days people will not need to quarantine on arrival, provided they are fully vaccinated. You can read the full report below: Of course with Queensland’s border opening, tourism minister Dan Tehan is out and about this morning taking a victory lap (even though the decision to open the border has nothing to do with the federal government). Here he is chatting to ABC radio: All the forecasts are, when it comes to domestic tourism, by the end of next financial year it will be back to pre-pandemic levels and international tourism will follow on the back of that, so there are positive signals for our tourism industry ... 660,000 jobs in our tourism sector, we want to make sure that reaches beyond post-pandemic levels and we need those overseas skills ... here in Australia helping us strongly rebuild the tourism sector. Things seem to be getting pretty loose over in the Barnaby Joyce isolation suite, with the deputy prime minister placing his phone inside a microwave to get the perfect camera angle for his Sunrise interview. I feel like there is a joke about radiation frying your brain in there somewhere, but I’ll just leave that up to you. China has responded “irrationally” to the Aukus pact between Australia, the US and Britain, defence minister Peter Dutton says. The conservative Australian minister continues to mount forthright criticism of the Chinese government, accusing it of “bullying” countries that stand up to it. Yesterday Dutton said the Australian government had formed the Aukus partnership with the US and the UK because it wanted to see “see increased stability and peace in our region”. “The response by China to that, I think, was irrational,” he told Sky News Australia. You can read the full report below: Time to chat about next year’s election, and the battle the treasurer is facing from an independent in his home seat. Michael Rowland: You are now facing, as we know, Monique Ryan in the seat of Kooyong. She’s a Royal Children’s hospital doctor. You’ve labelled people like she, an independent, as a front for Labor and the Greens. What evidence do you have for that? Josh Frydenberg: Well, at the last election, I had an independent who said they were gonna vote for Labor. That’s a pretty clear indication. We’ve also seen plenty of cases where they’ve just mirrored the policies of our political opponents. Rowland: But what evidence do we have at this time? Frydenberg: This is a rinse-and-repeat, Michael. What we’ve seen, we’ve seen obviously a lot of funding going into these independents around the rest of the country, and it’s a democracy, so people can put their hand up. ABC News Breakfast host Michael Rowland: Just on Omicron, you might have caught up with the news just in the last hour or so, Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, made an address to the nation there. He’s declared a tidal wave of Omicron case is about to hit the UK. He’s declared it a public health emergency, and has declared that all British adults over the age of 16 can get a booster shot by the end of the year. Taking that into account, are we being a bit too sanguine about Omicron here in Australia? Treasurer Josh Frydenberg: We saw the medical advice, and that saw a pause for two weeks of the reopening of the border to international students and to skilled workers. That was a precautionary measure. But we will continue to listen and follow the health advice, and it has served us well to date. But at the same time, we need to ensure that our economy keeps this momentum going. And we’ve seen a very strong rebound, Michael. We’ve seen 350,000 jobs come back since the start of September. We’ve seen business and consumer confidence lift. We’ve seen Australia maintain its AAA credit rating. We’ve seen a very strong pipeline of investment, both in the housing market and more generally across the economy. The Queensland premier taking a victory lap as the borders reopen this morning. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg is chatting to media this morning, discussing the Queensland border reopening. He was asked if he is “absolutely confident” that state border closures are now a thing of the past. I certainly hope so ... We do know that the Omicron variant is not the first or not the last variant that we will probably see with respect to Covid. We also know that it’s highly transmissible, but perhaps not as severe as previous variants. We also know that the vaccine has proven to be a very effective defence against the virus, with the number of hospitalisations and deaths coming down, and restrictions being eased accordingly. So, I’m very hopeful that the state premiers will stick to the plan, keep their borders open, and allow Australians to be reunited at Christmas and allow businesses to flourish. The NBN has announced plans to switch to 100% renewable electricity by the end of 2025 and use electric or hybrid cars where possibly by 2030, reports AAP. Australia’s NBN Co has announced a “towards-zero carbon ambition”, with the company outlining a plan to use electricity exclusively from renewable sources by the end of 2025. As well as purchasing 100% renewable electricity from December 2025, an initial three-year roadmap works toward switching to electric or hybrid cars were possible by 2030, and reducing annual energy use by 25 gigawatt hours by the end of 2025. Total electricity generation in Australia was estimated to be 265,232 GWh in 2020, according to government numbers. More than 8.3m premises are connected to the NBN network, and the company says it will seek a “more efficient use of energy as data demand and the number of connected premises continues to grow”. NBN Co chief executive Stephen Rue said: Beyond the direct impact of becoming an environmentally sustainable business, what’s equally exciting is the power of the network to help enable digitisation, and the huge benefits that unlocks for the nation in terms of emissions reductions, as well as socio-economic benefits. The company has already entered into a renewable power purchasing agreement intended to deliver almost 20% renewable energy to the network by the 2o23 financial year. It plans to reach the 100% target through further power purchase agreements and contracts for renewables. The announcement comes as NBN Co becomes the first Australian telco and government business enterprise to join RE100, a global initiative joining “the world’s most influential businesses committed to 100% renewable power”. RE100 Australian co-ordinator Jon Dee said: It joins 110 other major companies in Australia that have joined RE100 and made the commitment to switch to 100% renewable electricity. Between them, Australian members of RE100 use more than 5.5 terawatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power 800,000 Australian homes. The towards-zero carbon ambition is part of NBN Co’s second sustainability report released toay, which also looks at social and economic impacts. With 33% of management positions held by women, NBN Co outperforms the national average, it notes. Additionally, as at 30 June 2021, NBN Co had a gender pay gap of less than 1%. Good morning everyone and welcome to the new week! It’s Matilda Boseley here on the blog with you today and I have some good news to start us off. After nearly five months the Queensland border has finally opened! As of this morning, anyone from Victoria and NSW can enter the sunshine state as long as they are fully vaccinated and have proof of a negative PCR test before beginning their journey. With tens of thousands of people expected to travel today, Jen King is up on the NSW/Queensland border this morning to bring us all the updates. Let’s go west now because Western Australia’s premier is set to finally reveal when the state’s borders will open, ending months of speculation. Mark McGowan is expected to announce a firm date for the reopening, this morning, likely in late January or early February. The state’s borders are closed or heavily restricted to every other state or territory except Tasmania. It’s anticipated the vaccination rate will have climbed to 90% by the time the borders finally reopen. Once the borders come down, transitional restrictions will come into effect. This will likely include mask mandates in high-risk indoor settings, and proof-of-vaccination requirements for large events with crowds of more than 1,000 people, nightclubs and casinos. Entry to remote Indigenous communities will remain restricted and contact registers will still be used. OK! With all of that out of the way, why don’t we jump right into the day?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/jan/08/lab-grown-food-destroy-farming-save-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-08T06:00:21Z","webTitle":"Lab-grown food is about to destroy farming – and save the planet | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/08/lab-grown-food-destroy-farming-save-planet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/08/lab-grown-food-destroy-farming-save-planet","fields":{"headline":"Lab-grown food will soon destroy farming – and save the planet","bodyText":"It sounds like a miracle, but no great technological leaps were required. In a commercial lab on the outskirts of Helsinki, I watched scientists turn water into food. Through a porthole in a metal tank, I could see a yellow froth churning. It’s a primordial soup of bacteria, taken from the soil and multiplied in the laboratory, using hydrogen extracted from water as its energy source. When the froth was siphoned through a tangle of pipes and squirted on to heated rollers, it turned into a rich yellow flour. This flour is not yet licensed for sale. But the scientists, working for a company called Solar Foods, were allowed to give me some while filming our documentary Apocalypse Cow. I asked them to make me a pancake: I would be the first person on Earth, beyond the lab staff, to eat such a thing. They set up a frying pan in the lab, mixed the flour with oat milk, and I took my small step for man. It tasted … just like a pancake. But pancakes are not the intended product. Such flours are likely soon to become the feedstock for almost everything. In their raw state, they can replace the fillers now used in thousands of food products. When the bacteria are modified they will create the specific proteins needed for lab-grown meat, milk and eggs. Other tweaks will produce lauric acid – goodbye palm oil – and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids – hello lab-grown fish. The carbohydrates that remain when proteins and fats have been extracted could replace everything from pasta flour to potato crisps. The first commercial factory built by Solar Foods should be running next year. The hydrogen pathway used by Solar Foods is about 10 times as efficient as photosynthesis. But because only part of a plant can be eaten, while the bacterial flour is mangetout, you can multiply that efficiency several times. And because it will be brewed in giant vats the land efficiency, the company estimates, is roughly 20,000 times greater. Everyone on Earth could be handsomely fed, and using a tiny fraction of its surface. If, as the company intends, the water used in the process (which is much less than required by farming) is electrolysed with solar power, the best places to build these plants will be deserts. We are on the cusp of the biggest economic transformation, of any kind, for 200 years. While arguments rage about plant- versus meat-based diets, new technologies will soon make them irrelevant. Before long, most of our food will come neither from animals nor plants, but from unicellular life. After 12,000 years of feeding humankind, all farming except fruit and veg production is likely to be replaced by ferming: brewing microbes through precision fermentation. This means multiplying particular micro-organisms, to produce particular products, in factories.I know some people will be horrified by this prospect. I can see some drawbacks. But I believe it comes in the nick of time. Several impending disasters are converging on our food supply, any of which could be catastrophic. Climate breakdown threatens to cause what scientists call “multiple breadbasket failures”, through synchronous heatwaves and other impacts. The UN forecasts that by 2050 feeding the world will require a 20% expansion in agriculture’s global water use. But water use is already maxed out in many places: aquifers are vanishing, rivers are failing to reach the sea. The glaciers that supply half the population of Asia are rapidly retreating. Inevitable global heating – due to greenhouse gases already released – is likely to reduce dry season rainfall in critical areas, turning fertile plains into dustbowls. A global soil crisis threatens the very basis of our subsistence, as great tracts of arable land lose their fertility through erosion, compaction and contamination. Phosphate supplies, crucial for agriculture, are dwindling fast. Insectageddon threatens catastrophic pollination failures. It is hard to see how farming can feed us all even until 2050, let alone to the end of the century and beyond. Food production is ripping the living world apart. Fishing and farming are, by a long way, the greatest cause of extinction and loss of the diversity and abundance of wildlife. Farming is a major cause of climate breakdown, the biggest cause of river pollution and a hefty source of air pollution. Across vast tracts of the world’s surface, it has replaced complex wild ecosystems with simplified human food chains. Industrial fishing is driving cascading ecological collapse in seas around the world. Eating is now a moral minefield, as almost everything we put in our mouths – from beef to avocados, cheese to chocolate, almonds to tortilla chips, salmon to peanut butter – has an insupportable environmental cost. But just as hope appeared to be evaporating, the new technologies I call farmfree food create astonishing possibilities to save both people and planet. Farmfree food will allow us to hand back vast areas of land and sea to nature, permitting rewilding and carbon drawdown on a massive scale. It means an end to the exploitation of animals, an end to most deforestation, a massive reduction in the use of pesticides and fertiliser, the end of trawlers and longliners. It’s our best hope of stopping what some have called the “sixth great extinction”, but I prefer to call the great extermination. And, if it’s done right, it means cheap and abundant food for everyone. Research by the thinktank RethinkX suggests that proteins from precision fermentation will be around 10 times cheaper than animal protein by 2035. The result, it says, will be the near-complete collapse of the livestock industry. The new food economy will “replace an extravagantly inefficient system that requires enormous quantities of inputs and produces huge amounts of waste with one that is precise, targeted, and tractable”. Using tiny areas of land, with a massively reduced requirement for water and nutrients, it “presents the greatest opportunity for environmental restoration in human history”. Not only will food be cheaper, it will also be healthier. Because farmfree foods will be built up from simple ingredients, rather than broken down from complex ones, allergens, hard fats and other unhealthy components can be screened out. Meat will still be meat, though it will be grown in factories on collagen scaffolds, rather than in the bodies of animals. Starch will still be starch, fats will still be fats. But food is likely to be better, cheaper and much less damaging to the living planet. It might seem odd for someone who has spent his life calling for political change to enthuse about a technological shift. But nowhere on Earth can I see sensible farm policies developing. Governments provide an astonishing £560bn a year in farm subsidies, and almost all of them are perverse and destructive, driving deforestation, pollution and the killing of wildlife. Research by the Food and Land Use Coalition found that only 1% of the money is used to protect the living world. It failed to find “any examples of governments using their fiscal instruments to directly support the expansion of supply of healthier and more nutritious food.” Nor is the mainstream debate about farming taking us anywhere, except towards further catastrophe. There’s a widespread belief that the problem is intensive farming, and the answer is extensification (producing less food per hectare). It’s true that intensive farming is highly damaging, but extensive farming is even worse. Many people are rightly concerned about urban sprawl. But agricultural sprawl – which covers a much wider area – is a far greater threat to the natural world. Every hectare of land used by farming is a hectare not used for wildlife and complex living systems. A paper in Nature suggests that, per kilo of food produced, extensive farming causes greater greenhouse gas emissions, soil loss, water use and nitrogen and phosphate pollution than intensive farming. If everyone ate pasture-fed meat, we would need several new planets on which to produce it. Farmfree production promises a far more stable and reliable food supply that can be grown anywhere, even in countries without farmland. It could be crucial to ending world hunger. But there is a hitch: a clash between consumer and producer interests. Many millions of people, working in farming and food processing, will eventually lose their jobs. Because the new processes are so efficient, the employment they create won’t match the employment they destroy. RethinkX envisages an extremely rapid “death spiral” in the livestock industry. Only a few components, such as the milk proteins casein and whey, need to be produced through fermentation for profit margins across an entire sector to collapse. Dairy farming in the United States, it claims, will be “all but bankrupt by 2030”. It believes that the American beef industry’s revenues will fall by 90% by 2035. While I doubt the collapse will be quite that fast, in one respect the thinktank underestimates the scale of the transformation. It fails to mention the extraordinary shift taking place in feedstock production to produce alternatives to plant products, of the kind pioneered in Helsinki. This is likely to hit arable farming as hard as cultured milk and meat production will hit livestock farming. Solar Foods thinks its products could reach cost parity with the world’s cheapest form of protein (soya from South America) within five years. Instead of pumping ever more subsidies into a dying industry, governments should be investing in helping farmers into other forms of employment, while providing relief funds for those who will suddenly lose their livelihoods. Another hazard is the potential concentration of the farmfree food industry. We should strongly oppose the patenting of key technologies, to ensure the widest possible distribution of ownership. If governments regulate this properly, they could break the hegemony of the massive companies that now control global food commodities. If they don’t, they could reinforce it. In this sector, as in all others, we need strong anti-trust laws. We must also ensure that the new foods always have lower carbon footprints than the old ones: farmfree producers should power their operations entirely from low-carbon sources. This is a time of momentous choices, and we should make them together. We can’t afford to wait passively for technology to save us. Over the next few years we could lose almost everything, as magnificent habitats such as the rainforests of Madagascar, West Papua and Brazil are felled to produce cattle, soya or palm oil. By temporarily shifting towards a plant-based diet with the lowest possible impacts (no avocados or out-of-season asparagus), we can help buy the necessary time to save magnificent species and places while these new technologies mature. But farmfree food offers hope where hope was missing. We will soon be able to feed the world without devouring it. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist.
